## Project Description
Kaya ChildCare is a childcare centre dedicated to providing childcare support for kayayei children while their
mothers are out working. The centre is designed to run to fit the schedule and life of the Kayayoo mother
which currently opens at 7:30 AM on weekdays, Monday through Friday. One Sunday per quarter, workshops
and programs are organized in health, hygiene, sanitation, and nutrition for the mothers. The centre caters
for the nutrition, health and cognitive needs of these children. It runs as a not for profit entity which allows
the Kayaei mothers to bring their children.
* There is only one class of users:
* Staff - these are the users who control the activities for the care center. They are responsible for caregiving, organizing events,
speaking to partners, getting donors, monitoring child development and fostering research for the center

### Main Functionalities of the Data Powered Site
The general purpose of the platform is to allow Kaya ChildCare have a
robust system in place to help track their activities. Functionalities of
the platform will include:
* Information for both a mother and a child enrolled under the program
* Keep records on cognitive, health, and nutrition data for the children
* Information on children who need extra health care and have
developmental gaps
* Information about the staff and the development stage class he/she
teaches and the students under her care
