85614,wonderful experience,5
85615,"I took this course about 10 years off the college, and it was excellent refresher on the topics I don't use on a daily basis. Absolutely great lecturer, great videos and study materials!",5
85616,This series is really the course you need to take if you feel not comfortable and want to know why(or describe the feelings) when you code in school or work.,5
85617,Not as good as part (a). But still a great class!,4
85618,Incredible continuation of an already amazing course.,5
85619,"Lovely course! The treatment on closures was great, and I really enjoyed the programming exercise.",5
85620,Part B of a 3 part course. One of the best i have taken up on Coursera,5
85621,Excellent course material. Homework is a bit esoteric though.,4
85622,Great course on Racket. Fun writing your own interpreter.,5
85623,"I learned a lot from this course, thank you.",4
85624,"Great course! Learned more about PL, what is interpreter/ compiler language, what is statically typed/ dynamically typed. The homework is very rewarding! Looking forward to Part C.",5
85625,Dan Grossman is a really amazing teacher! Learnt a lot! :),5
85626,Perfect course series for me!,5
85627,AMAZING COURSE!,5
85628,"good course, writing an interpreter in racket was fun",5
85629,"An absolutely high quality class. The instruction is superb, the assignment is on par with top programs at Stanford, MIT, and CMU. Dr. Grossman's lecture is just so clear and energetic that makes learning this hard topic fun.",5
85630,I learn lots of important programming language concepts from here.,5
85631,excelent introduction to pro tools,5
85632,"Except the fact that it was taught well, I believe that pressuring people work with a specific program to pass a course is not helpful. I believe that instead of learning how to handle PRO TOOLS from scratch you should change the course to something more creative like recording different instruments, measuring the studio space, monitors and much more helpful things than advertise and make AVID richer.FriendlyAll the best",1
85633,This is an excellent course! It takes you through all the steps you will need to start producing music with Pro Tools. The instructor (ChrissyTignor-Fisher) gives some awesome tips that will help you make your productions even better.,5
85634,"Excellent course, very well organized and the teacher is really direct and clear, which made it much more effective!",5
85635,"Great! The course is very cool Well thought out, practical and fast, I was able to learn in a very short time all the tools needed to continue learning. Today I'm doing all my recordings in Pro Tools. Many thanks to Chrissy Tignor-Fisher for the brilliant teachings.",5
85636,simple and understanding,5
85637,"Great introduction course. Unfortunately the Protools free version is very weak and limited. After I finished the course there was no motivation to go ahead with so many limitations in the SW. I can't even create more than 3 songs :-( Besides that, the ProTools price is too high to buy it for personal use.",4
85638,I absolutely enjoyed this course! I gained the confidence I was looking for through the positive instructorChrissy Tignor Fisher she really made it fun.,5
85639,"Very interesting course! Although I knew a couple of things before, I also learned a lot. On the other side, I was a bit limited at the moment of doing assignments since I used Pro Tools First. So certain things were only theory for me. However there was a lot of things to learn and I did! Thanks Chrissy!",5
85640,"It's awesome. I thought that I'm quite expirienced Pro Tools user, but I've discovered its very useful functions from this course. Also you'll get here basic knowledge of mixing and mastering in easiest way to understand and you can use that knowledge in any DAW you want, not only Pro Tools.",5
85641,a little too short but good,4
85642,"a little too short, which is good",5
85643,Great Basic course to start you off,5
85644,Very nice course!,5
85645,very helpful,5
85646,"Standart indutrie DAW, but not my favorite. Good performance from the teach! I had many issue with pro Tools first, be sure to get a full vertion and an iLok key from avid before enrolling, will save much stress and trouble.",3
85647,"Is a great course for musicians, producers and composer. It's a great DAW",4
85648,"For a course with the name ""Pro Tool Basics"", I was expecting some specific knowledge about this particular software but what the course really teaches is basic music production things (samples, synthesizers, how to create tracks, how to record audio, compressors, EQs, etc).As I am already a music producer using Logic Pro, I was hoping to learn more about the software itself and its differences in comparison with other DAWs in the market, so I was a little bit disappointed in the end!",2
85649,"Great introduction to Pro Tools even for the seasoned amatuer who's been playing around with DAWs. I now have basic skills with Pro Tools, plus my editing and mixing skills have improved. This course won't make you a pro but it's a great introduction and well worth your time if you're a newbie or have stalled in your amatuer persuits. **thumbs up**",4
85650,"Amazing course. I loved each lesson, the examples, the methodology, the teacher is Amazing!!! (Feel like we're friends now!) Very easy to follow exercises and achievable assignments.",5
85651,"Great teacher! Entertaining, easy and fast way to learn Pro Tools! She's Awesome!!! :D",5
85652,"Great course with a fantastic teacher who kept every lesson easy to understand and interesting. Thank you for this course, it was really useful!",5
85653,"I came into this class with already quite a bit of self-taught experience with Pro Tools. I think this course provided an excellent foundation with the software. It covered the full arc of getting started, learning the fundamentals, and then concluding with a final project that incapsulated many different skills and functionalities in order to present a final production of a song. You have to put in the work but if you follow through on the instructions carefully, I think you'll be rewarded. Chrissy is a compelling and adept explainer of things and she also peppers in some good fun and humor along the way. It's clear that she's very knowledgeable and navigates through Pro Tools with ease (keyboard short cuts are vital).My main goal here was to make my workflow much more organized, smooth, and structured while also becoming much more confident in my mixing abilities. Chrissy explains in very simple and clear terms how to accomplish these tasks which left me feeling satisfied. Good job!",5
85654,Great!!!,5
85655,"The course may be called Pro Tools Basics but this requires also basic audio knowledge. It shouldn't be explaining about microphones and how to connect an XLR cable.Also it was more a course on how to compose electronic music on Pro Tools rather than using Pro Tools for recording and editing. I mean not so many people use Pro Tools for composing. Pro Tools is a global standard for recording, editing, mixing and mastering. I was waiting to learn more things on these topics and not on EDM...P.S.I really like EDM but this shouldn't be the main focus of the course!",3
85656,Great course with all the basics covered and clearly explained with good examples.,5
85657,"Great Course. I wish there was more lessons as to how to record acoustic instruments (guitar, piano,drums). I did not know anything about Pro Tools before course, and now I am able to setup a simple recording session. thanks",4
85658,"Although it is a very informative class and Chrissy is a good teacher, I am finding this class to be EXTREMELY troublesome unless one possesses the means to purchase a great deal of equipment and product to work within Pro Tools. It should be noted that Pro Tools First (the ""FREE"" version I downloaded) is a DETRIMENT to learning in this course and will effect your grade negatively. I am also dismayed by the lack of community participation in the forums. On other Berklee / Coursera classes, this hasn't been nearly as much of a problem.",2
85659,Full of great information!,5
85660,Very nice basic course. Pretty understandable.,5
85661,"The reason why I gave one star is because I don't think its content is completely related to its title. This course is very similar to music production but using only pro tools.If you are looking to learn more about music production using pro tools, then this is an awesome course but if you already have some background in music production and you just want to learn pro tools basics, then I don't think this is an appropriate course (in my opinion).",1
85662,Some creative stereo FX will be better for the course,4
85663,"Top quality. I have read many instructions manuals on Pro Tools, and too many poor YouTube videos. I have learned more in this course than in all of my other investigations and studies put together. Clear, concise, and understandable. It gets to the essence of understanding and being able to use Pro Tools. Avid should hire Chrissy Tignor-Fisher. Excellent instructor! Please consider an advanced course in the future!",5
85664,"Excelent.The basics of Pro Tools; but also the basics of elementary concepts of audio and music production. The teacher is awesome, super understandable.With just this course you are set up and ready to go on the Pro Tools journey on your own.",5
85665,It's a wonderful course. You learn from people who knows how to teach you.,5
85666,Complicated things made so easy to understand!,4
85667,Very Good Course!,5
85668,Very good course explained in a clear and nice way!,5
85669,This course is a good shortcut to start Music Production using Pro Tools. Practical tips and relevant information.,5
85670,THIS IS THE BEST CURSE I TAKE THANKS TO ALL COURSERA AND BERKLEEE TO MAKE THIS POSIBLE FORM SOUTH AMERICA THANKS TO ALL I REQUEST U CAN MAKE TOO PROTOOLS BASIC MIXING AND MASTERING COURSE PLEASE,5
85671,"Berkelee's Pro Tools Basics is one of the best courses I've taken here. Chrissy Tignor-Fisher is a wonderful teacher. She is very knowledgable and explains everything clearly, with an encouraging and inspiring attitude. The lecture videos are top-notch, with excellent presentation quality and tons of relevant information. Course assignments provide plenty of creative learning opportunities. Last but definitely not least, the peers in this course are so supportive, kind, and talented. It's been a joy to be a part of this course. Highly recommended to everyone! *****",5
85672,"An absolute joy! Chrissy has a wonderful presentation style and an ability to explain in detail without patronising the student. The best Pro Tools course I have undertaken, and the first Coursera course I have felt comfortable actually submitting work to.I would be eager to follow any other Pro Tools courses presented by Chrissy.",5
85673,I have big expectations with this course !!,5

85675,Thanks a lot! :-),5
85676,Very good tool to get introduced into the serious DAW world. Recommended!,5
85677,"This class has been the best Pro Tools course I have studied .Chrissy Tignor-Fisher has put together an incredible progressive lesson plan . The video lessons are top notch . The quality of audio and visual are crystal clear . The information is presented and demonstrated with such clarity it keeps you wanting to learn more . Chrissy I,m at week 4 of your 5 week Basic Pro Tools course . I took the class so I can really start tapping into the power of Pro Tools and get my studying habits back up to par . Yes there are assignments and deadlines through out this course . Thanks to the Coursera and Berklee Team for providing this platform of education . I look forward to participating in more courses provided by Coursera.",5
85678,"Good and quite extensive course. The only drawback I find is the language diversification. Some teachers use English and some Spanish, with opposite subtitles. If I were the organizer, I would suggest video classes in Spanish (as the teachers seem more fluent) with English subtitles, given that Spanish is the 2nd language and English the 3rd. Text classes in Spanish and English alike. Greetings to the excellent teachers and thank you very much.",4

85684,"Its good course, I have learned allot.",5
85685,"The course has very nice and easy to follow content for a beginner. I think it could be even better if two small problems are addressed. First, in the lecture videos some slides are to fast and I had to pause or go back several times. Second, the course content is not equally distributed among the 4 weeks.",5
85686,"Wonderful, useful information, Slides were very useful. it would be good if it could slow down just a bit.",4

85709,"Very clear, and a lot of useful information. Thanks!",5
85710,This course has revolutionized my thinking about every task I need to accomplish. It should be introduced to students as soon as they reach middle school.,5
85711,The class and the content is very good! But the way that the professor teachs is kind of boring for me.,3

85716,"Very interesting course that gave me an excellent overview of the project management process. But, I would have liked more practice with a capstone project for example!",4
85717,Very basic. The structure is odd; the last week contains more material than the rest of the course put together.,3
85718,Great introductory overview of the subject. Highly recommended.,5
85719,A quick and essential course for everybody who wants to review the basics of project management.,5
85720,The first three weeks are totally trivial. I hardly doubt that anyone learns something except how certain practices are called. (Maybe good for school students.) Week 4 is better. I recommend the lecturer to improve the previous weeks and to redistribute some of the contents of week four. Some real-world examples which point out typical mistakes or give useful hints would be welcome in the first three weeks as well.,1

85736,I would have like it if they could provide free graded assessment to non-certificate students; and make option for certification,3

The instructor, Rob Stone, PMP, M.Ed. delivered the course so perfectly! He is definitely a guru in the subject of Project Management. I liked his delivery: he met you where you are; and he is also likeable. His instruction felt like one-to-one and tailored to learners at different levels.

86041,"The course had many information provided and thanks for that. But there are some things I disliked and I guess by fixing them the course would become much much better.1. The information refers to the PMBOK very often. That is good, as the PMBOK worth (must?) reading for any PM, but it is a bit difficult to understand anything while a teacher just retranslates something, from any book — especially not written by the one — with poor examples. The much better way for lecturer is to explain it by oneself, not by just staying there and repeating what I can read from my display.2. I dislike fixating to any software. Maybe Microsoft Project is a good example, but I am sure not the only one at first, and as I am a Mac person who has personal Macbook and Mac Pro at work I am not going to use Windows only for one application. There are plenty of them these days, the same or just similar. The key is not a software itself but the methodology using in the one. The methodology is worth understanding, for sure.3. Grammar mistakes and misprints. It looks a little strange that no one reviewed the materials: neither on Coursera (I am sure it is not so easy to review every course) nor the creators. I am highly puzzled about how it could be possible: if it is a free course for someone there are also many of those who are paying for the courses, and the courses also represent the University. How the University cannot find someone to check the mistakes before publications? (To be precise there are tiny mistakes related to headers and graphics which make the materials looks untidy).4. Materials production is very poor in details, even for the key ones: typography, colours, thickness of the fonts and lines. There are no contrasts, no highlighting — that looks as a draft, not as a final course worth spending the time, effort and money. If there are no people available to help with producing the materials of a good quality you can ask people from trueowl inc. (the website is trueowl.com and the working email is trueowl@trueowl.com) to help with it. They — we, as I am member of the team — are highly concerned about educational materials and motivated to enhance the quality of the materials, even for free of charge.Anyway I am glad I finished this course, as it gave me understanding which way should I continue with diving deeper into the theme.Thank you!",3
86042,"I thought the course did a nice job of covering the subject, but it seemed to jump around from the original struct",4
86043,Very usefull,5
86044,"This course seemed to me the most un-interesting course. The content though important was not taught in a way to engage the student. The professor basically read everything.

Please use real world PM uses, not going to work..Show examples of project management that went horribly wrong..lots of those examples as well.",3
86119,"Instructor seems uninterested or bored. Sometimes he only reads the slides without adding anything else to the content. Others, he goes quickly through a slide without any time to digest the information. Overall, intro level concepts are ok, but specifics about creation or handling of tools is left without deeper explanation",1
86120,"A great overview, not any real depth, some practice examples would be nice. Good for those who have never done PM at all as a primer.",4

It helped me get a clearer perspective on how things are being planned and what methodologies are in use at present times.

Small projects based on the application of some planning software would really add more value to this offereing by the University iof California, Irvine.Thank you Professor Rob Stone",4

86190,"Great course! I would add some business cases to complement the learning. Would have been nice to have a brief video on ethics about pricing.

86201,worthy enrolling this course.,4
86202,"I've really enjoyed this course. There is a great mix of approaches to the subject matter - video lectures, interviews, case studies, articles/textbook excerpts and short quizzes. The balance between covering a wide-enough range of topics, and giving sufficient depth of information is just right in my opinion. Overall, this led to a really engaging experience and I feel that I've learned a lot. Moreover, there is plenty of practical guidance as to how principles can be applied in a business context. Thank you for doing such a great job of putting this together.",5
86203,"So far, this has been my favourite module. thought it was thorough and challenging enough for anybody to learn but also down-to-earth for newcomers, the right balance, which is a heroic act to achieve in a",5

86208,"Thank you, Professor, it was really interesting and a little hard in the beginning. Everything very logically described, everything clear.",5
86209,The techniques used in this course really help to first keep you in business and second distinguishing yourself among other competitors. The other advantage of this course was its quizzes which help me to get more of the each module by presenting real world practical cases.,5
86210,"The professor did not Interact with people, I was wiling to see some discussions and contributions among people",1

86213,Brilliant and Helpful,5
86214,Very useful,5
86215,"Excessively short course. Like previous course in the specialization no slides of the lectures were provided. Approach over-simplistic. IE could done more. Also as in previous course there was no supervision from the staff of the discussion forums. Also looking at the big picture, there is a tremendous gap in quality and approach to online courses between EU institutions and US top tier institutions (favoring the US offerings). Looking at Wharton, U. Michigan, Yale courses (just to mention a few) and then looking at the majority of European offerings, the gap is very salient. If IE wants to stay relevant in this online space, some benchmark is advised... If you are in the 'game', you must 'play' it better...I hope you will accept my critic as constructive and positive, not as negative. As an European I am more critic and I would like to see more quality, relevance and credibility of EU offerings. As it is, it is a matter of time until Wharton and U. Michigan spread their offerings into this specific field and with a superior approach they will most likely divert students to their offerings, probably lowering and marginalizing your courses.But despite my critics it is fair to salute you for your efforts and availability to offer this course.I wish yoy luck.Ricardo J. Oliveira",2
86216,Thanks for a completely awesome course! :-),5
86217,"Professor was excellent; engaging, clever and clear to understand and follow.

I signed up for the Public Speaking specialization and am looking forward to taking my next class.",5
86218,Definitely learned a lot. Facts like do not repeat yourself is good advice for writing or when you are coding!

But more important, he gives a great example and guideline on how to prepare it. Highly recommended MOOC.",4
86233,"Great content delivered in a manner that is easy to understand and also is useful for non-native English speaker and applicable to at least some of the European languages.What could be improved is adding slides to each of the lectures. Also content wise it felt a bit small, both lectures and assignments required very limited time per week (probably around 2h/wk).",4

86235,I love that,5

86239,Amazing course,5
86240,Awesome. I learned lot. I think I am getting better at presentations and public speaking,5
86241,"This course has been an eye opener for me, I truly enjoyed it. It gives you basic knowledge of what it takes to be a good public speaker, and you can apply this knowledge not only in presentations, but also in your daily life. The most difficult part for me was to make the videos and watch myself, but it really helps in your improvement. Also, the feedback of your classmates makes you see things you haven't caught. Try it out, you won't regret it.",5

I am working across cultures as a leader and although I know a few things about the subject it can still give me deeper understanding and a better overview as well. I wish this course would have been available when I started my international position, I might have avoided some mistakes. Still it is not too late to learn:-)",5

The reading materials are also impressive - not just relying on the theoretical context. HBR articles are on the the best reliant sources at the moment and as a fan of Harvard deliverables, I am glad that the University put it as the references. The video is out of the box. Involving the alumni having important position in mutlinational companies is a smart idea.

86315,"Ok course.When I am taking a course from Wharton school, and from adult learning perspective, more is expected than simply small lectures and few activities. Some areas that I see this may be improved...1) Latest evidence based support (few articles/papers) on achievement and satisfaction (Success both parameters). This is widely discussed field as subjective and objective career success.2) In addition to SAME - better instruments/scale those are easily available online.3) Some better links to career related articles from Harvard/California management review or organization dynamics on the topics covered.",2
86316,I learnt a lot！thank you,5
86317,"After this course I was able at least to formulate these ideas on paper and tried to work out the plan. I think this is not the final action list, I can add more in future.",5
86318,So far this course has helped me to understand my self better than before,5
86319,"To me as a beginner, it's a great course",5
86320,"Well thought out and designed. Great opportunity for those who have full personal and professional lives already, but who are looking for a structured way to self-reflect. Very manageable time commitment. There is as much to get out of the course as you want and as little to get out it as you decide.",5
86321,"Great class! Professor has really interesting life experiences, stories, and activities to help you reflect on your own life and journey towards success.",5
86322,Fantastic course! The professor shared some interesting personal stories and explained things clearly with helpful examples. The course altered my perspective of success and gave me a better sense of how to live a more fulfilling life based on my personal values.,5
86323,Just take this course,5
86324,Really good!,5
86325,"So helpful and interesting. Thank you so much Richard for sharing knowledge, personal and professional experience and wisdom! I feel very happy, energized, inspired, connected.",5
86326,"Very helpful course changes my mind about success. I have heard the similar ideas from others, however, it makes a difference in a Wharton course. Recommend this to everyone.",5
86327,"This is a valuable course. Everybody, successful, unsuccessful, in the pursuit of success, should pause and rethink about what success truly is.",5
86328,Amazing course,5
86329,"Fantastic course. It's very thoughtfully designed and was perfect for the type of reflection needed to evaluate one's life and develop a theory of success. I appreciated Professor Shell's openness to the different ways people might define success. He is definitely not trying to push anyone in a particular direction, but providing resources to figure out your own direction.",5
86330,One of the Best courses I've taken in my life,5
86331,great course,5
86332,"I enjoyed this course and recommend it highly. I just wish the instructions for the exercises were clearer...but I have to admit I had many distractions and other things going, so I could have done better.",4
86333,The perspective of balance of this course is absolutely how I do see success. Is greatly explained and motivates the student in a very good way.,5
86334,simply excellent. thank you so much for this course,5
86335,5-star pending on me passing the course - of course! :) great stuff!,5
86336,I would just like to say thank you.,5
86337,"A great course! Professor Shell is calm and articulate, which makes his course that much more transformative. I found renewed motivation and insight in my search for success. Thanks again Professor Shell!",5
86338,"Tough course. Study hard to have best results, folks.",5
86339,"Complete and useful course about Process Improvement. You can learn, also, about the philosophy and the history behind the Lean Six Sigma",5
86340,"An introductory course to Lean Six Sigma and DMAIC. Fairly well presented by Prof. Anand. A primer in basic statistics would be recommended before commencing with Module 3. To the creators: Some lessons were lengthy and I would suggest max video length to be 20 minutes each. All in all - a very interesting and relevant topic. I would recommend this as a ""start here"" to anyone who intends pursuing the more comprehensive and rigorous Yellow/Green/Black belt body of knowledge/certification.",4
86341,Comprehensive. Understandable. Very knowledgeable instructor. Excellent teaching skills.,5
86342,"It's really interesting the approach on this topic, which is very focused on the real aspects of the process improvement and not only a list of techniques.",5
86343,"Great review of concepts to refresh lean and six sigma, and process improvement in GENERAL.Expected deeper and more practical information (case studies, maybe a project in a module instead of a quiz, etc.) regarding the service industry as stated at the beginning of the course. There just one part of a module (aprox. 15 min) that got into some detail.Also, there was no interaction at all in the forums. If at least the mentors could set some interesting subjects and comments to motivate that, would be of help.Due to this, my expectations weren´t met. Was looking for detailed service industry (financial) applications of process improvement knowledge.",2
86344,Good overview of the basic tools that are used in various process improvement processes. I'd prefer to have a multiple course series reviewing this topic rather than a single course but this is still good for what it is.,4
86345,Very clear and concise. Exercises and quizzes were very educational.,5
86346,Overall great professor. The the course has a lot of real life examples. Would recommend the professor using a book in conjunction with notes. There are power points but they are limited on information that's given. Then there's transcripts that have all the information in the video. However you're looking at is 50 + Pages of paper for the ranscripts.,5
86347,"I would not recommend this course. The content is very relevant to the subject matter. However, the lectures are much longer than they need to be, and filled with unnecessary commentary. The instructor often verbally discusses the statistical formula with a few bullets on a slide with the focus on himself. The delivery would be much better if the instructor would put himself in the background and the focus be reoriented on a whiteboard style walk-through of the equation at hand.",2
86348,"I love that topic, but I think, the videos are too monotonous. Maybe give it more pop-up quiz to make it better",3
86349,"Course material is a bit light, missing useful pieces of information. The example code is functional but not of sufficient standard to pass the documentation exercise. The solutions to the exercise are not covered in the course material. It takes a lot of outside work to get a good mark. Course is good, but the material needs a bit of work.",3
86350,This is a critical skill and it's barely covered anywhere else. Thanks for making this course!,5
86351,This was a great challenging course! Love it.,5
86352,Very good course for intermediate/advanced R users. Sad that you are elegible to do assignments only if you pay.,5
86353,"I liked the course a lot since it is actually covering most of the things related to the package development. Nevertheless, I still feel (the same as with the previous classes) that authors could have spent more time building the course materials as many chapters are very brief and if I hadn't had the past experience with some of the topics, I wouldn't have any idea what the course is telling me (e.g. merge conflicts in git).",4
86354,"This course provides useful knowledge in building R packages, as well as opportunities to implement our knowledge. However, as the previous courses in the series, the last module (week) is extremely challenging compared to the previous ones.",4
86355,Just reading. There are not videos.You are not allowed to submit the quiz if you do not pay.,1
86356,Interesting and informative course.,5
86357,"it is an awesome course , with many information.",5
86358,Very useful,5
86359,"Great course, learnt a lot!!",5
86360,Good Course，I studied it twice...,5
86361,"This is a very useful course. There is a lot of web apps these days and Python seems to be a very powerful way to access, translate and use data from the web.",5
86362,Excellent course!!! Presents some nice applications of Python in analyzing web data.,5
86363,Great Course!,5
86364,Super Course. Helped me lot with web scraping.,5
86365,"course is very good, assignment is very good",5
86366,Dr. Chuck has done it again! Another excellent and highly entertaining course on the Python programming language. Highly recommend for anyone looking to look a little more deeply into this amazing programming tool for people in all manner of jobs.,5
86367,Very basic introduction to Python.,4
86368,I am upset that I can't complete this specialization for free but oh well. Thank you Dr. Chuck for your hard work.,5
86369,The way Dr. Chuck teaches and shares his knowledge is way too much fun and easy to understand. Made me to think that Python is easy to work and more enjoyable. Thanks to Dr. Chuck and Coursera.Please carry on with your great service to the online community!!,5
86370,Very detailed course and lots of information to digest. Thanks to the team and tutors.,5
86371,Many thanks Dr. Chuck,5
86372,Explain very well how to capture urls from the Internet and then manipulate them as files....,5
86373,"Seemed rushed, concepts not explained fully. videos are too formal, professor not funny and less relaxed than during the first two modules of this specialization",3
86374,This was one of the best course I ever took in python. Now I use it to understand the web and also to write API program. Thank you so much Coursera,5
86375,"Great course, well paced for Python beginners but thorough",5
86376,"Simple and fast intro to read HTML, XML and JSON.",5
86377,I've learned much about how to use python to process web data. This course is easy to understand and pretty helpful.,5
86378,"Amazing tutor, excellent course!",5
86379,"I definitely recommend to anyone interested in python programming to consider take this course with Dr Chuck. It starts from the basic and become a bit challenging and it is enjoyable whiles you start projecting in ways to use it. I am looking forward to continue learning and be prepared to apply it in my work. Thank you Dr Chuck, the way you teach and interest to integrate student from around the world is very much appreciated.",5
86380,Thank you Dr.chuck!!,5
86381,thanks a lot. I learned web scraping,5
86382,great course,5
86383,"Thanks MR. Chuck! you're always so humorous and thought-provoking!A small suggestion: when switching on the transcript button, the scripts would bar some PPT contents (bottom parts), which then asks you to switch it off.Prof. Chuck the course series is indeed really helpful and leading for students! Thank you.",5
86384,I loved the course and learned a lot!,5
86385,Good To leran,5
86386,Dr. Chuck is the best,5
86387,Materials and assignments are easy to understand,5
86388,I do not think some quiz questions are covered in the lectures.,3
86389,Great teacher and great course!,5
86390,"Very good, useful content. Great instructor presents material in a way that's very easy to follow along with. Recommended.",5
86391,Quite practical for web information retrieving.,4
86392,"As a high school teacher learning how to process student performance data to drive instruction, I found this and Dr. Sev's instructional style incredible helpful!",5
86393,"It took me longer than I had hoped to complete this course, but it is very satisfying to finish. Dr. Chuck, I appreciate your passion and your dedication to teaching the world about Python. Thank you very much!",5
86394,Good course for the beginning of 'Spider'.,5
86395,Excellent course and teacher!,5
86396,"I am learning a lot but I understand there is a lot to learn, this course had the basics of it and Dr. Chuck explains everything very well. But would have been nice if the assignments were little harder ;)",5
86397,Thank you for helping me with study this course!!!,5
86398,thank you Dr. Chuch the course is amazing,5
86399,"The course material is great, but the assignment is too simple, especially the last(You don't need to write any codes). I think the assignments can be more challenging.",4
86400,"Good course for accessing web using python, Thanks!",5
86401,Thanks dr chuck!,5
86402,it is very meaningful and useful.,5
86403,"I have learned exceptionally well from all the materials, lab work and videos through out the course.",5
86404,"Very challenging course but very useful and fun, enjoyed it, Thanks Dr. Chuck!",5
86405,Very useful course !,5
86406,"Great course, thanks!",5
86407,"very useful syllabus,",4
86408,An excellent course to breeze through for getting a disciplined knowledge in accessing web data with Python.,5
86409,"It felt really neat to be able to call web data. It's starting to feel like what I'm learning will be useful in my job and life now. Dr. Chuck makes things easy to understand, but the assignments generally contain enough tricks to guarantee that you understand the subject matter.",5
86410,Thank you so much for this helpful course!!,5
86411,5 starts. A bit more difficult than prior sources but that is what i expected. Dr. Chuck keep my interest with his charisma.,5
86412,Useful course. The explanantion is very clear.,5
86413,Awesome Teaching! Learnt many concepts in an easy way.,5
86414,"great courses,good.",5
86415,"This course was informative, useful, and fun - one of the best programming courses I've taken on Coursera. I'm on the road to being able to use python for data cleaning and analysis in my work and this course felt like a major stepping stone. I'd like to sincerely thank Dr. Chuck for putting this course together - he's giving so many people an opportunity to learn to code.",5
86416,"This is a good course, now I can do a lot more things with Python",5
86417,great start using Python,5
86418,"Now we're cooking with gas. This is course three of five in the University of Michigan's Python for Everybody series and things start to become real. Where Course 1 was very action/reaction in learning Python's basics, Course 2 was more abstract (and the weakest of the three so far), Course 3 builds on the other two and you get to taste Python's real world potential. Granted, this is all an introduction series and nobody is walking away from these courses into a full time developer position - but you do begin feel functionally dangerous (in a good way). The biggest takeaway from the course is giving you that taste of what is possible. We don't know how to do it yet (and the course isn't going to go beyond the intro depth) but after this third course you're likely getting smitten by Python and know you want to avidly take your learning beyond this series.",4
86419,"Awesome course, love the professor!",5
86420,The course is very good. However the course covers only the basics of how to use python to access web data. It would have been good to add an assignment to use REST APIs in the real world scenario.,4
86421,Great course,5
86422,I love this subject and I learn a lot about how to use python to access web data. Dr.Chuck is so humorous,5
86423,Love this course!,5
86424,Amazing! Very comprehensive course,5
86425,"Dr Chuck is incredibly talented at explaining things, and has style!",5
86426,"great class,I study a lot here, hope for more similar classes!!",5
86427,Dr Chucks lecture are great and full of fun.,5
86428,"Dr. Chuck is awesome, love his courses!",5
86429,Awesome material. Great introduction with practical applications. Awesome lecturer. Thanks!,5
86430,Very powerful course for beginners to programming and python that immediately gives you the tools and skills to do interesting things with the web and web data!,5
86431,Very poor that in order to submit any exam I have to purchase the course when I can download the book and learn as well.,1
86432,There should be more programing exercises.,3
86433,Great class!,5
86434,great course,5
86435,thanks everyone related to this course i really enjoyed a lot,5
86436,Good Stuff!,5
86437,"Dr. Chuck's explanations are clear and all the lessons are easy to follow: focus on relevant web technologies, perfect pace, examples based on popular APIs. As someone with some basic knowledge in programming already I was expecting the assignments to be more challenging. As clearly announced on the website this course is targeted at beginners who took the previous courses from the same teacher: all exercises can be solved in about 10-15 lines of code and the solutions can be directly applied from the videos without much further thinking. The rest of you will, like me, breeze through it in no time. Kudos for the interesting interview videos proposed as bonus material!",4
86438,very good，it's helpful for me!I am so happy that i can learn how to use python,5
86439,"Great course. Learned a lot about JSON and XML. Expanded my view of what is possible in programming. Never explained SOAP or why it sucks, and I can kinda explain REST, but still not quite sure what ""representational state"" refers to. Its just data, no state, and no representation, so why is it called that. Thanks!",5
86440,"Excellent Python web access , examples and practice real cases. Great Teaching!!",5
86441,I have a good time to learn this course . Thanks all all the staff.,5
86442,nice course for intermediate user. It would be better if there is some assignment (maybe only a few) have more challenging questions which cannot found much hints in lecture notes.,5
86443,The assignments are just difficult to solidify understanding without becoming frustrating or getting stuck. The mentors are very helpful and quick to respond.,5
86444,Great series of courses at just the right pace. I can do one in my lunch hour and not have to think about 4-5 hours of study per week. Also you can self pace and go much faster so you can finish the course in 1-2 weeks but I always find it is better to take a little longer to let the ideas sit and bounce around a little.,5
86445,This course if great!,5
86446,"An excellent course, Dr. Chuck manages to put various things with ease. Material as well as teaching is excellent. However, I found the necessity of having more programming exercises with more difficulty than what course presently offers. More exercises with higher difficulty are needed to emphasize the material we have learnt. Apart from that, this is an excellent course.",4
86447,Best teacher I've found yet,5
86448,"Very useful, explained in detail basic concepts.",5
86449,Good intro to APIs,4
86450,Wonderful course and instructor. Bonus video are also very helpful.,5
86451,Great course.,4
86452,"Amazing course with an even amazing professor! Keeps me so involved and inspired to finish the course and the content is so interesting, I dont feel like I should stop these courses! I have already started using the concepts I learned here into my daily work.",5
86453,Very helpful....:),5
86454,Incredible course! Incredible Topic! Incredible Instructor!,5
86455,This is an amazing course teaching is excellent and good for a beginner.Dr. Chunk Rocks.,5
86456,Very good course. I definitely opens a window of possibilities!,5
86457,Great course with fun and useful,5
86458,One of the most enjoyable courses i have taken. Lots of interesting 'real-life' exercises.,5
86459,"The course is quite interesting and fun, I enjoy the moment I got the correct output. (:",5
86460,It's a solid cour,5
86461,"This is not another general Python course which leaves you with an 'idea' of what can be done and you struggle to actually do it. This course is in fact giving you all the relevant tools you need and leaves you with a set of practical skills allowing you to write Python codes to extract Web Data that can be used for further analysis. Creating a web browser, screen scraping, parsing XML, or JSON are among the actual skills you're getting and this is all possible thanks to the first class lectures and materials provided by Dr. Chuck. He has a particular talent and desire to teach and explain things to you so you will understand them for good.",5
86462,Great course! Very challenging while using all of the knowledge conveyed in the previous courses. The assignments are interesting in getting the lessons topics across. Multiple ways to get the correct results and allows you to be creative.,5
86463,good learning on how to exchanging data across the web. Quiz & Assignments are little tricky though overall had a great time.,5
86464,"Wonderful course for anyone with zero prior coding experience, or those who know other languages but want a way to grasp the important basics of Python.",5
86465,Very useful and practical.,5
86466,Great training by Chuck,5
86467,There's in a change in the way of presenting the course. I prefer the previous 2 section though.,4
86468,Very good short introduction.,5
86469,"I felt a big jump in the learning curve once we reached XML and JSON. I could complete the assignments because all I had to do was make small changes to code provided, but I don't feel like I've even close to understood yet! Will keep re-reading the book chapters...",4
86470,This is the most friendly course i have ever had. The course is very useful for beginners with no background in programming and those who want to understand the behind the scenes part of the WWW.,5
86471,This was really a very great experience to have this course. I really had a good time and interest while learning the things. the best part of all these courses are that its very interesting and knowledge feeding,4
86472,great teacher! great course!,5
86473,Awesome! Easy explanation.,5
86474,Excellent course! Very well prepared. Looking forward to the next one.,5
86475,"I like the teaching style. I have learned how to do web scraping, parsing json and APIs. Reading the book was very helpful in addition to the lecture videos.",5
86476,Well thought out.,5
86477,Lecture slides were well explained and assignments were not too difficult so getting demoralized was out of the question. Thanks for everything.,5
86478,Very interesting.Enjoyed every minute.,5
86479,So useful as usual. Thank you Dr. Chuck.,5
86480,Great stuff! Expanding my CS knowledge tremendously,5
86481,very useful course,5
86482,"Again, great course from awesome programming teacher Dr. Chuck! Recommend this course for anyone who wants to learn the basics of API and web parsing.",5
86483,"I feel so great participating on this course, as I do learn lots of new stuffs regarding on Web socket, HTTP request, Data interchange through web service and many more. I having great fun and enjoying every single lecturer throughout the course. Excellent experience !!!",5
86484,"Amazingly excellent course. Many thanks for Dr. Chuck for creating that. Everything explained very well, enabling doing simple steps to quickly achieving results. For those who alreay know some programming I would really recommend starting from this course and skipping the first 2 courses. Skipping means it's better to read the first 10 chapters Dr. Chucks's book through and start this course right after that. It will save your time allowing not ot do too simple tasks but just read about the Python syntax. The course is also great because of Dr. Chuck's talent to explaing everything with fun and ease. Definitely 6 stars out of 5 for the course!",5
86485,Really good course. Helped me add more tools to my internet hacks. :),5
86486,"Great course, I learnt a lot coming from no programming background.",5
86487,Gained a basis for working with Web Data in Python. Good course!,5
86488,This course is really awesome and a great motivator towards learning python :). Love you Dr Chuck <3,5
86489,Excellent course and very well presented,5
86490,"Awesome course. As usual, Dr. Chuck presents the material in a very intuitive and fun way. The videos are a joy to watch and I look forward to the programming assignments. Would definitely take more courses taught by Dr. Chuck!",5
86491,Highly recommend for those that do not have much free time.,5
86492,I have really enjoyed this course and is getting more and more complicated but that is actually why is challenging.,5
86493,"Enjoy every bit of the course. Again, Thanks Dr. Chuck",5
86494,Was well structure until the part about accessing parsed data in JSON; this was a little rough as the example provided in the lecture accessed data like: parsedjsondata['person']['age']. In the actual assignment this does not work and I had to use a work-around by using range(len(dictionary)) which is not covered in this course.,4
86495,Very good course showing how to interact with the internet. Assignments could have been a little more taxing but on the whole it gives a flavour of what is possible.,4
86496,I really enjoyed this class. Thee professor's way of teaching makes it very easy to understand python. I am looking forward to his other future classes,5
86497,Thats a great course and the instructor teach superbly!,5
86498,"I enjoyed the course very much. One can start the course before the formal date, which is a very good option for the people, who does not have much time. Thanks a lot for your work.",5
86499,Somehow this section is bit confusing or rather to say the content is not really enough to work alone. Not even to solve the assignments without example codes.,3
86500,This course is really fantastic! Both the lecture and assignment are well prepared.Now I have got basic concept of accessing web data using Python.It's time to write my own Web crawler now!,5
86501,Good introduction to getting data from the web. I've used this course to scrape fantasy football data and analyse it in Excel,4
86502,"Once again, another excellent course from Dr. Chuck. However, the Coursera format has changed from that of the previous two courses and the submission of quizzes and assignments are now locked; they don't show progress or get marked as completed unless you purchase the certification. So, if you're auditing the course, don't bother with the quizzes and don't expect the course to show your progress (mine still says I'm on week one) or be marked as completed in your profile even though you've watched all the videos and submitted the assignments.Dr. Chuck, I understand that University of Michigan has to find a way to monetize these courses. However, since the previous courses used auto graders, and this course seems to as well, I'd like to request that the quiz and assignment features be unlocked so auditors can see course progress and completion like the previous two courses.",4
86503,Absolutely fantastic lectures,5
86504,very nice course that introduced me to the very useful geocoding thing.,5
86505,A perfect course for anyone new to the Python language.,5
86506,Very informative and easy to learn such cool things. Thank you for providing me such an opportunity to learn via Coursera.,5
86507,Great intro course for accessing data on the web.,5
86508,Excellent course. Concepts explained in an easy to understand manner.,5
86509,Keep going this way!,5
86510,I really appreciate all the hard work put by the professor to make this course a great one and i helped me to see and experience a new side of python which i lack before.All mentors were very helpful and would eagerly take other courses of this specialisation.Thank you all.I had a great learning experience.,4
86511,Such a great course! I've used BeautifulSoup an JSON a lot while scraping the web and this was a nice foundation refresher. It also taught me coding conventions and I didn't realize I needed! Like properly encoding URL parameters to APIs,5
86512,"Good course, great instructor!",5
86513,This is an excellent introduction to Python´s web data handling. Very written as expect from this specialization. Thank you very much Dr Chuck and University of Michigan for this great Coursera´s course.,5
86514,"Course is good, the problems should have been a little more complex. Thanks to the faculty for such a great course.",4
86515,"Another good course in the Python Specialisation! You'll need to have a thorough grounding in dictionaries and lists for this module, so make sure you're across the concepts and syntax of those data structures :)",3
86516,老师讲得很好。虽然课程中用到的是Python2，我自己用的Python3，但是对照课本，完成作业没有问题。讲到XML和JSON那里，感觉有点难懂，下一门课要上一下Internet History，technology and Security。谢谢老师。,5
86517,"Third one down in the specialization and still loving the courses. I quite enjoy the fact that the assignments are not given to us step by step but instead make us think through what is required. The lectures provide the basics needed to complete the assignment but you have to understand and extrapolate on the basics provided. Still very motivated so far. The next course is the main reason I enrolled in this class, getting to play with databases. Thank you Dr. Chuck.",5
86518,Good class. Clear presentation and learning programming skills.,5
86519,In the last two weeks I have gained an immense amount of knowledge under Dr. Severance. Thank You!,5
86520,"This course is garbage. The instruction videos are fine, but the assignments are imprecise in their language at times, and there are certain key points needed to complete them that aren't covered in the videos. The mentor in the forums is lousy, and his responses are worded as if he's talking with a peer and not a beginner/student.I may or may not try another coursera course after this. But if this experience is any indication, Coursera isn't very good. The same UofM course appears over on Udemy, and I wonder if it is just being repurposed on as many platforms as possible without the care needed to make sure it works.",1
86521,Thank you very much! An amazing course and great presenter!,5
86522,Excellent course material provided. The videos contain all the necessary elements required to complete the assignments. The assignments are also well designed to test your knowledge learned from the videos. Kudos!!,5
86523,"To know more about the wonders of Python Language and its related concepts in the web world, this is the course that one can take. Thanks to all who made this specialization available to us :-)",5
86524,"I really enjoyed the course. Maybe too easy if you already have some coding experience, but very good for beginners.",5
86525,nice easy course,4
86526,"Interesting intro to JSON, REST, SOA with Python.",5
86527,Great Course from a great man :D,5
86528,"There could be more assignments (maybe more complex, or with different outputs) to fix the knowledge of the video lectures.",5

86555,"This is the third of 5 courses in Python 2.7, so the full 5 courses are excellent for a Beginner to become a solid Intermediate, this Web Access course alone should only be taken by those with some Python programming experience (like the prior 2 beginning courses on programming and data structures in Python). I did the course using Python 3.5, from Anaconda, after starting the more challenging MIT 6.00 courses (2 of them), which use 3.5 but are faster paced yet with more challenging problems. [Some issues switching from 2.7 to 3.5 -- there now is a revised Open Source book using py3x] Dr. Chuck's course offers true high quality learning but allowing me to work my 40 hrs /week and do the course, altho it took me two sessions to finish. Now fully completed after switching to the next later session. NOTE - these MOOCs allow one to switch to the next session when one falls behind; this is better for getting TA help in the forums when there is a problem. Thanks!(above is same as Class Central, below is new)How could it be improved? By having for each required assignment a similar but more difficult optional assignment, which can be further discussed in the forums. I'd expect that switching auto-grade assignments & sample code to be py3.5, especially the print() change, would be fairly easy and allow students to choose which version to do the assignment it.",4
86556,Easy to understand yet very useful course. Each module starts with the basics making it look easy. The assignments are very useful and lets you play with the code to do more than what is asked. Really enjoyed this course!,5

86571,The lectures are well explained. But the programming exercises are too basic . Expected the programming assignments to be more challenging . Good course but each week could be completed by 2-3 hours . And the 6 week course can be completed within 1 week by casual work . But its a good introduction to access web data using python . Recommended for beginners .,4
86572,Really Great,5

86602,"Nice course, you get an introduction to using python to access different types of widely used formats of web data.I liked that, apart from showing how to ""get the stuff done"" with Python, the course also explores a bit of the history of each of the tyeps explored and tries to ""scratch the surface"" about how each of them works.On the down side: I think the code already provided for each assignment is too much. One ends up not writing his/her own code, if not for a couple of additional lines.",4

86707,Very good class,5
86708,Every course taught by dr Chuck is a new quality. Substance of the course is little more demanding than previous 2 courses but paradoxically I had a feeling that new topics were taught without going into details... which paradoxically is good for the course. Dr Chuck showed some teasers of Python abilities and if You are more interested in some topics You practice in on your own,5

86720,"I thought the content layout for Courses 1 and 2 were okay. However, when I got to Course 3: Using Python to Access Web Data, I was extremely disappointed. This specialization is advertised as one does not require programming experience. Course 3, however, introduces a variety of computer science topics that I believe cause information overload for a beginner. A student is bombarded with information about regular expressions, the HTTP protocol, web sockets, URLs, HTML, XML, JSON, and APIs. In fact, the video lectures spend the majority of the time explaining these concepts, while spending very little time explaining how to use Python to access web data. The corresponding book, Python for Informatics, was of little help understanding the assignments. Like the videos, the book lacks sufficient numbers of examples. The few examples that are given lack adequate explanations of the code they contain. I found myself on many occasions asking, ""What exactly does this line or block of code do?"", and could not locate the answer. If not for the forum, I would not have been able to complete th",1

86749,Very helpful and detailed.,5
86750,"Good, too much of seeing the professors face while in the middle of explaining code. Not that he's ugly, but when looking at code, it helps to keep it on the screen a bit longer, rather than showing his face momentarily and then back to the code.

86755,Thank you Professor Severance!,5
86756,"I have got a very handsome introduction to the regular expressions , web services and API . The lectures are very easy to follow. It is better to answer the quizzes right after watching the vdo lectures. The questions are mostly from what has been described in the lecture. The assignments are a little more insightful. May require basic google searches to acquire knowledge of accessing the data structures. The assignments addresses rudimentary practical problems but very substantial for starters in this field of programming. Thanks to Dr Chuck. The course is very well organized and have materials to hold the attention of the person who is following the lectures.",5
86757,a little bit too easy for person who had basic knowledgement of python,3

86760,"I moved to the US a couple years ago and started my career from scratch in completely different sphere - Quality Assurance. I never supposed myself to be a technical person and felt uncomfortable with IT things. I have in my head the combination of tech terms and tools mixed up with huge gaps, this course helped me to systematize my knowledge and feel more confident and engaged with what I am doing. I completed 3/4 sessions and would rate the first two 5 stars, and probably give a little bit less, 4 stars, to the third one, only because sometimes I had to find on the Internet additional materials which were not covered by lecture and course materials to complete my assignments.",4
86761,Dr Chuck is great.The assitance on doubts is also really good.,5
86762,This course came in handy JIT for my new job. It made me a look like a rock-star to my new manager and director! It has pushed me further into Python and realizing it's much easier to deal with than powershell.,5
86763,Charles was very clear and describing the ideas behind the code which makes it a lot easier to understand.,5
86764,"This course is entering a different web world, which is a little complicated for me to understand it. In general, Professor Severence did a good job to show the basic ideal for us in an relatively easier way.

86811,"This is the best and interesting part yet, I think. This is because, its the place where the cool applications in python begin.",5
86812,"I was shocked when I saw the inventor of Python from this course. But now I got used to see any inventors of Internet. After you met those Internet Inventors, you felt anything about Internet is simple.The way Prof. thought was very fun and easy to learn. Great!",5
86813,"This course teaches basic knowledge about how python accesses web data. Simple but really worth learning. In addition, Dr. Severance's lectures are very clear to understand. Overall, it's a great course.",5
86814,"good course, maybe a bit too rushed and easy",4
86815,I liked the course a lot.,5
86816,"Maybe homeworks are too easy, but they are concentrated on the course...",5
86817,Getting a little more difficult but you have the tools to do it. Make sure to reference previous classes/chapters. Class is good in that it makes you use what you've already learned to solve new problems.,5
86818,Very interesting and helpful. It equipts me with the very basic but useful knowledge for python.,5
86819,"Great, as usual :) Thank you Dr. Chuck!",5
86820,Great class!,5
86821,Wonderful class!,5
86822,Very nice course!!!!!,5
86823,"I found that some parts of the course were confusing. You really have to take the time to read documentation to do the assignments, which was difficult with my busy schedule. (And just because you read the documentation doesn't mean that you understand the code!) Overall, I learned a lot and still recommend the course - just wish there was less background and more explanation of the actual codes that you can use while parsing.",4

86837,Dr Chuck is awesome!!!!,5
86838,Its very useful.,5
86839,"The Teacher made me thirsty of more work. Especially in the last chapter, I was looking for more challenging work. The way the assignment was designed and the topics were taught made me think, the assignment for the last week was quite easier and I was expecting something more challenging. This proves the beauty of this class. I wish I have a trainer like this always with me, at least as long as I cannot go out and look for work myself.Thanks a million to Dr. Charles Severance. This is a very positive experience.",5
86840,It is the best course thanks for all,5
86841,"Very useful course. Good design from instructor, easy to learn with examples. useful for most non-professional program writer. thanks.",5
86842,"I have enjoyed this course very much - same as the two prior courses. The main differences are: this course was much more difficult and Dr. Chuck used some new video recording technology. I thought the presentations were more direct and to the point, but enjoyed the previous style from earlier courses as well. I would recommend this course and the associated courses to anyone.",5
86843,"This Coursera need a little background in programming, and Dr Charles is fun boy! He teaches this class in a easy and vivid way! Getting basic skills from extracting data from internet! learn to deal with popular data structure in the web world",5

86884,"The course is quite vivid and practical. Dr Chuck has always been humorous. Surprisingly I've learned a lot through this course.(Another thing to mention: the assignments concerning XML is quite hard, and perhaps need more illustration in lectures.)",5
86885,"A clear, step by step introduction to using python to get and parse information from the WEB - using URLLIB, XML and JSON",5
86886,Nice class with Dr. Chuck!,5
86887,"Basic but great for beginners! I think a lot of people will ""break the ice"" with Coursera courses with this one.Really fun!",5
86888,Fantastic learning and entertaining as well,5
86889,The course did give me the the theoretical and syntactical basics in terms of how web programming is done using python. Chuck Severance is brilliant in his ability to explain complex concepts by reasoning via analogy. It would have helped if the problem sets were more challenging and in tune with real world applications.,3
86890,This got a lot more challenging.,5
86891,Very useful.,5
86892,"Just go for it, learn lot of things and have fun.",5
86893,"Great course. Interesting and fun. Final assignment could be a bit more difficult, imho (but that doesn't make me give me less than 5 stars).",5

86900,"very very impressive course, learn some interesting coding, concepts everyday !",4
86901,Great,5
86902,Very structured and comprehensive course. One of the best of coursera!,5
86903,Thank you all,5
86904,Bonus videos are good and motivating,4
86905,"Compared with last two courses, this course is a little more difficult to understand.",4
86906,I found this course difficult than the previous ones and would give a suggestion of adding more weeks if the course syllabus demands.Syllabus of this course is very vast and so lectures must be increased.,4
86907,Very easy class with a lot of fun.,5
86908,"People use Python for many purposes: to make games, build web services, to solve business problems, to work with sensors, drivers and robots. Python is also used heavily in scientific fields for academic research and applied work.Python is an incredibly efficient language: your programs will do more in fewer lines of code than many other languages would require.Py4inf and Python explained by C. Servance, is a great developing of the foundations in programming (first two courses) that will serve you well for the rest of your life, as well as a course that will give you a sort of try to understanding of what great things python can do for you.I strongly recommend this course for anybody, who wants to start with informatics.",5
86909,"Professor Severance is awesome. I really like how each video is an in-depth look at a specific example and that he tells you what to ignore and when. I think his sense of what's important is spot on as I've already started to apply some of his lessons to personal work and find that as I work through personal projects, the next question I have is usually covered in the next lecture or soon thereafter. The videos build on one another in a very coherent manner and the assignments are applicable to what you learned. I think the assignments could be a little more challenging and that more references to the book should be included in the lectures as the book is also very helpful and a great primer for each week's material, especially when it comes to understanding parsing XML and JSON more. I think more chapters on this in the book could be very helpful though.",5
86910,I really enjoyed the class. Dr. Chuck makes full use of the medium to make it interesting. I read the book before but this online course really brings python to life.,5
86911,The courses are awesome!,5
86912,"This class does a good job of easing you into the world of retrieving and using web data. Though, I do wish that there were just a few more assignments at the end in order to solidify the learning a bit more.",5
86913,This course is really deep and useful!,5
86914,Awesome Course! Many thanks for making this course!,5
86915,I really like this course. I will recommend this to all beginners.,4
86916,One of the best courses that I've taken this year. The Ebook for the course is great.,5
86917,A good start to understand what goes around API world.,5
86918,"Good course, very helpful",5
86919,superb course thanks.,5
86920,"Great job, Dr. Chuck! :)",5
86921,"Excellent course, straightforward and Dr Severance has a great teaching style. Pragmatic and clear. Thoroughly recommend this course.",5
86922,pretty good and awsome,5
86923,"Great overview, but not enough of a good thing; I would have liked for the course to be a bit longer and go more in detail. Still an interesting course for beginners.",5
86924,"I like the way the instructor teaches this class. It is full of fun and knowledge. I feel like to use python a lot more now, thanks to this coursera class!",5
86925,Not too difficult but learned a decent amount.,4
86926,I've really enjoyed this course. Dr Chuck makes the course content very easy to understand. Thank you!,5
86927,Where the first courses were really about laying down the python foundations this one showed me the first practical applications. I really thought that this API business was never going to be easy to understand but thanks to this course I am now directly getting data from our online ERP system and creating my first simple analytical programs.Really exciting stuff!,5
86928,Dr. Chuck is one of the best.,5
86929,Great course with practical examples!,5
86930,Loved This One Too!,5
86931,Not clear examples in the videos. Tests are way different than what the Prof. covers in the videos.,3
86932,Well organised. Dr. Chuck is a good instructor. What more? He teaches you web scraping and XML parsing.,5
86933,"I only received 96% as a final result, even though I obtained 100% for every assignment. Pathetic rating system. If I had paid for this course I would be incensed.",1
86934,Very engaging and fun. A little too basic with not enough exercise though.,4
86935,"More than what one will expect!Excellent Course!Thank You, Dr. Chuck. :)",5
86936,"Nice cours , I enjoy it ! thanks a lot Sir about all your efforts",5
86937,"Learned a lot about Google and other APIs, and how to use them! Definitely helpful when learning about how to access and analyse important data sources!",5
86938,Prof is amazing!!,5
86939,"Great course to get involved in how Python can resolve web problems like accessing data, logging and other stuff, it's a very complete course that teaches you the essentials of managing web browsering and service with python.",5
86940,Maybe too easy and too less exercises. The lectures are very clear.,4
86941,Dr. Chuck is Phenomenal! thank you,5
86942,Very clear introduction!,5
86943,"适合新手 还有很多不足之处。There are fewer supplemental materials. I think it can give more import supplementary, especially the most relevant portion of the book.",4
86944,"Like always, pretty good.",5
86945,It's a great course!!,5
86946,Engaging instructor! Loved his style!,5
86947,"Great instructor, great topic!",5
86948,"Very interesting, you could learn a lot.",5
86949,This has been hugely helpful in my new informatics role. Thank you!,5
86950,Just the right course to begin with to play with web data/api's,5
86951,A great introduction course. However the assignments are not challenging enough.,5
86952,Really a nice course! Dr. Chuck makes it easy to use Python to access web data! Thanks a lot!,4
86953,A very good course which simplifies everything.,5

86956,Great course!It gives you a great foundation for using Python with the Web.Really an interesting part with the APIs,5
86957,"too basic,you need read more online resources to do real projects.",3
86958,"Great course, especially for those already knowing some coding, to get a full dive into accessing the most common web data formats. Dr. Chuck's lectures are funny and really out of the usual coding classes.",5
86959,"Best of the best. Great instructor and materials. I finished all 4 classes of the series, which tells you how much I enjoy learning from this instructor.",5
86960,Great course for introducing web data to Python,5
86961,Good one,5
86962,I am learning very powerful tools for extracting web data. I love it and the professor is great.,5
86963,Awesome Mentor and Course outline.,5
86964,It has a lot of information about web in general. Dr Severance is fun to listen to and definitely not boring.,5
86965,Wonderful course!,5
86966,This section is very interesting and I get a lot from it !,5
86967,"Excellent course and excellent teacher.The course is well organized that though it's a bit rough at the beginning , once you get into the mindset the video lectures and assignments come together very easily.",5
86968,Assignments could be a little more difficult and not exactly like examples. Still a great course and I learned a lot about retrieving data from urls.,5
86969,Wonderful courses for introducing such productive tools under Python to access web data!Thanks to Dr Chuck!,5
86970,I absolutely loved this course. I really enjoyed the course material and the instructor was always very engaging!,5
86971,"I used to be in one python programming course in school. That course ended by BeautifulSoup. This course just added to where I wanted to continue. Very clear demonstration, I'll definitely finish the following courses in this series. Thank you Dr. Charles!",5

86973,Great course,5
86974,"Excellent course, fantastic instructor. The lectures are well-designed and well-delivered. The assignments are not challenging enough, but overall they were fun.",5
86975,Great lectures and instructor. I love this course and learnt a lot.,5
86976,Charles Severance focuses on practical applications with just enough theory. This gives you enough tooling to work independently with web data and doesn't require much time commitment.Thank you to this course's team.,5
86977,"Really nice course. Help was available when I needed it, however I think some of the integration of urllib needed to be better elaborated.",4
86978,Excellent course and excellent instructor. I highly recommend taking this course!,5
86979,"First, thank you Dr. Chuck for the well-designed class.Here are a few things that may help improve this class:first, it might make more sense if you introduce python class or object first, then the package and method and return type will make more sense.second, it could include more coding for scraping on the web, the examples are very limited(well, ok I understand this is a pretty introductory course....)Last, for those who use python3, there are many thinks you should notice to make ur code work, such as from bs4 import BeautifulSoup, also notice the urllib has been split so you should import urllib.request and urllib.parse, also for those return value as byte, use decode('utf8') to convert it to strings, otherwise it will cause a lot of trouble in json",5
86980,"Really awesome course to know how to access web data using python. I love this materials because those materials are excellent, excellent teaching style perfect examples.",5
86981,There are many details don't explain clearly enough for a beginner to understand.,3
86982,Thanks,5
86983,Excellent learning platform!,5
86984,"Very tidy and step by step course. Dr. Chuck has a great sense of humour, it wants you to keep wanting more. The bonus videos with all the great inventors of the languages is like cherry on cake.",5
86985,Awsome course,5
86986,I would say a very good introduction to the topic.Would be nice if maybe in the future you would add some more advanced excersises ( just to gain more practice),4
86987,Huge thanks to Dr. Chuck.,5
86988,Had a great time learning how to access web data using Python!!!,5
86989,Pretty good. It was only a refresher for me.,4
86990,"Great class. The video lectures cover the topics in a very interesting and easy to understand way and the exercises make sure that I understood what I learned, also, I like the idea of providing part of the source code which helps maintain the focus on the things that are newly learned while writing the code.",5
86991,"Things start to get a bit complicated in this course, but the step-by-step approach saves the day and you actually improve your programming skills without really noticing the process! Doctor Chuck rules :)",5
86992,Very good course!,5
86993,interesting and helpful!,5
86994,"Awesome starting point for whom wants to know about ""web access using python""",4
86995,Just great!,5
86996,Great for beginners. Would be better if assignments were more challenging. Really had fun while learning :),4
86997,Great course to give you intro for using python on the web.,5
86998,Pretty great for understanding Python basics. Best way to start your Python or programming life. B|,5
86999,"Such a awesome course which is plausible and easy! I am also a prospect student to UM, hoping to see Dr. Chuck there!",5
87000,it was great but I needed the previous ones more. I Hope next one will be more practical for me.Thanks Dr. Chuck :),5
87001,"excellent, very instructive between each program proposed",5
87002,Good for starters.,5
87003,"I thoroughly enjoyed the course, and learnt a lot.",5
87004,Great class,5
87005,Very good course! Professor is engaging.,5
87006,Great course explained in simple way.Finally got a grasp of Regular Expression and Json.,5
87007,"print 'That was awesome, thank you!'#Oops, an infinite loop...while True:print 'Long live our noble Dr. Chuck!'",5
87008,I've learnt a lot of new. I've discovered such things as XML and JSON for myself. I hope this course become a great beginning for my further studying of computer science. Thanks to Dr. Chuck and his comtades.,5
87009,"It's good to learn how to access web data including specifically html, xml and json.",5
87010,it's hard to understand,3
87011,the best python teacher and materials i have encountered so far!,5
87012,"Strange as it may seem, I would have liked more assignments to reinforce all the new concepts I tripped over on my way to finishing this course.",4
87013,"Great class, like the previous ones. However, I liked the split screen with the slides on one side and the video on the other better.",5
87014,A very very good course. Dr Severance did an excellent job and provides a very thorough explanation of the topics. I would recommend this course for anyone interested in learning Python in a hands on and interactive way. The quizzes and the exercises were good and directly track the course material.,5
87015,"Very good course, it's worth trying!",5
87016,Excellent coaching & content. It would be great though if the contents where in python 3 instead of 2,5
87017,"something not clearly explained, maybe I was stupid.",4
87018,"Unfortunately on the whole I was very disappointed with this class. I took the first two Python courses and found them manageable, but this third one was an unrealistic increase in difficulty from the previous two. I reached out for help on the discussion board a number of times and saw many others were struggling as well. Mentors who responded to some of the other students were clearly getting defensive when those students were getting nowhere on the assignments. I think this program should reevaluate itself so students such as me can keep up with the assignments. On average I was spending about 10 hours per week just on the syntax for building the programs.A little about my background: I have 20 years of experience in the private sector and am currently an analyst in cyber security. I have an undergraduate degree in finance, an MBA, and another master’s degree in Data Analytics. This 5 course program has been described and sold as beginner level, and given my background I should have handily been able to complete it, but that was definitely not the case. Normally I don’t leave feedback unless I feel strongly about something, so I hope you take it seriously. Thanks.",1
87019,"This course helped me to understand a lot of things, and gave me the knowledge to create my own web scrapper tool for my web app",5
87020,I could have all basic knowledge in accessing web data using python.Thank you professor!and Thank you Coursera,5
87021,"Absolutely a MUST for anyone looking for a smooth intro into APIs, HTTP requests, and data exchange on the web. As always, Dr. Charles' magnificent pedagogy will guide you step by step up to the point where you will be sending requests and fetching data from your Twitter account. Create one if yo do not have it yet. :-)It will be absolutely beneficial to update this course to discuss the Twitter library available in Python, wish is far easier to use than the currently explained method.",5
87022,This course is much harder than the first two but you will learn A LOT!,5
87023,very useful course. Out of the whole specialization loved it the most !,5
87024,"This is the third course in the Python for Everyone series, which builds on the lessons of the first two courses. The course's automated grading made it easy to continue with each assignment at my own pace; and the way the information is presented makes it easy to learn without getting frustrated.",5
87025,Great!,5
87026,"Neat work, excellent class structure. simple and practical.",5
87027,Very completed course as usual!,5
87028,very useful and interesting,5
87029,good course!,4
87030,One more great course on Python from Dr. Chuck. Thank you very much! I love this sirie of courses!,5
87031,"A very good introductory course to learn web scraping. Awesome instructor, Dr. Chuck.",5
87032,best of what I have seen.,5
87033,I still have a confused feeling of this course's content.,4
87034,"very nice but since they never used a framework for python, that was disappointing.",5
87035,Nice course but it needs harder assignments,4
87036,Great!,5
87037,Very good course .... python has the language of future,5
87038,"The instructors breaks every concept into easily comprehensible bits, so the next time you resume learning you build off a firm understanding. Great course.",5
87039,"The instructor is able to explain the concepts clearly and effectively. After participating in other Python courses, I have come to appreciate Dr Chuck's method of teaching a lot. Also, I love the ability to practice what is learned.",5
87040,"I learnt Python with the introductory course ""Programming for Everybody"". Then, I completed this course and it added a whole lot of tools to my knowledge. It is amazing how much you can accomplish in such a short course. The assignments are very well oriented, so by basically modifying the code you wrote for this class you can already do a lot. It also gives you a very good basic knowledge about web programming, so you can now understand and interpret many things and concepts you are seeing all the time. I recommend it a lot.",5
87041,"Excellent course, recommended for anyone who wants to build web applications using python.",5
87042,Very good course,5
87043,Great Course!Built a Instagram Bot and WhatsApp bot for personal user after completing this courseAwesomeThanks a lot Dr. Chuck,5
87044,The class is interesting.,5
87045,Very well planned course.,4
87046,A wonderful course for python enthusiasts...,5
87047,Another amazing course from Coursera and Dr Chuck.,5
87048,"This course got very technical very suddenly which was really fun! From normal python to regular expression python, to surfing the web with python (by suddenly writing a web browser) and then suddenly using python to leverage on APIs. Each chapter is a really fun quantum leap in understanding!However, I felt that the lectures could be better delivered for that chapter (less wordy, chunky notes, more examples) because it's really a whole new world each time.Really worth the time and effort though!",4
87049,"This course is both clear and essential, no rubbish-talking, I really like it. Thanks to Dr. Chuck and Coursera!",5
87050,Best Course out there ! Thank You !,5
87051,The best course for getting started with Python and thinking about computer programming.,5
87052,Excellent - but I wish that the course had tougher assignments to really push me to practice on the topic - although I admit this is hard to grade.,4
87053,Thank you!,5
87054,very good information of many concepts and nicely put together.,5
87055,"The course is helpful for me. It gives me an overall view of what's happening inside every click of mouse on web browser. Through this course I've learned about XML, JSON, how to parse those data, how to use and request API and many useful things.Thank you Dr. Chuck for your series Python class.",5
87056,Great content! Easy to understand and follow.,5
87057,Thanks for presenting the comprehensive introduction on not only python but the knowledge of the internet structure. And the plus interviewing videos with internet pioneers are really interesting.,5
87058,Excellent Course. Thanks to Charles :),5
87059,"Excellent course by an excellent educator, Dr. Chuck. I will continue the next module. Thank you, Coursera and Dr. Chuck.",5
87060,A very good course and teacher !,5
87061,Great introductory series of courses led by Charles Severance. Lot of fun and learning and good sense of humor of Dr Chuck. Fantastic idea with series of video interviews with people who made great impact on computer science. Thanks:).,5
87062,excelent course to learn Python. Congratul,5
87063,Amazing course. Learning a lot here. Thanks,5
87064,Its a super great course!!!,5
87065,Well taught.,5
87066,Many Thanks for Dr Chuk for presenting us the well crafted course. Kudhos!!,5
87067,Superbly explained. Maybe there should be a intermidiate level to this.,4
87068,Really enjoyed it.,5
87069,Simple and good beginner course.,5
87070,Really good python course,5
87071,The course is awesome but really need extra efforts.,5
87072,This course is very useful in your workplace!,5
87073,Simply perfect!,5
87074,Most excellent and useful online course I've learned!,5
87075,"Great class. Goes over the basics of pulling data from online sources: HTML, XML, JSON. Also goes over the basics of those 3 so if you know nothing about those, the class is helpful. Coming from knowing literally zero about Python and starting from course 1, this is the first course out of the specialization where the assignments were a little tougher and took some googling. (PS I'm using Python 3, so it may be a little more straight forward with 2, I'm not sure though)",5
87076,"Best courses ever !As a bioinformatician, Python is a very essential language to learn, and it was never easier than this.Thank you Dr.Severance!",5
87077,I learned alot from this course .,5
87078,Great contents and very simple presentation of materials that anyone can understand..,5
87079,Very good for a beginner and a programmer trying to be a Pythonist,5
87080,Instructor is great!,5
87081,Very interesting. Has a lot of sense with the two previous courses. Fantastic!,5
87082,"Very informative, learnt a lot of practical skills in data analysis",5
87083,Dr. Chuck is simply awesome.,5
87084,Awesome experience. I would like to meet Dr. Chuck personally someday :),5
87085,pretty good!,5
87086,"Thank you very much, dr. Chuck. This course was very helpful.",5
87087,"Five stars from me. Shows what Python is really good at, which is gluing the service-oriented architectures together.",5
87088,All the concept are extremely well explained.,5
87089,Dr. Chuck is the man. Well prepared class!,5
87090,"I learnt a lot with Python web data. I found it easy to assimilate the lectures. Chuck, the teacher insist that you follow the previous course but I found web data accessible to someone that barely used python. The mentors are helpful in the forums.",5
87091,"good content simple yet covered many parts , learnt about rest api and other things . As usual Dr Chuck you are great mentor . Thanks",5
87092,Great course!,5
87093,Great teaching. Genuinely share useful tips and add fun into teaching. Best teacher I have come across thus far on Coursera and Edx combined. Keep the great work!,5
87094,Good course on web crawling.,5
87095,GO DR Chuck !!!. Good Course,4
87096,"Thank you, Dr.Chuck! You're the best! I will talk with all my friends about Coursera and the great programs you have.",5
87097,Nice introductory course. It will be useful for beginners.,5
87098,Dr. Chuck seems really passionate about both teaching Python and giving students a understanding of the role Python fills in the world of computer science. Great course for beginner programmers.,5
87099,Easy To Learn !,5
87100,Very advanced but easy,5
87101,We can start using our programming skills and access data from the web and use it. Very easy to understand and brilliant presentation.,5
87102,Very interesting and informative course!,5
87103,"This is one of the Best intermediate python course you would find out there. Being taught by a professor from a reputed University, you could blindly enroll. It mainly focuses on Web scraping",5
87104,"i really enjoyed this course it became one of my favorites it is quick it is concisous has a lot of knowledge, it is perfect",5
87105,A great course and teacher!. congratulations !,5
87106,"An excellent course, not only the Python instruction but also the various videos",5
87107,Great professor.,5
87108,pretty awesome !!!,5
87109,"Good course, again very clear instruction.",5
87110,Very well organized. Dr. Chuck is awesome!,5
87111,Concepts are explained very clearly.,5
87112,Its a good course.,5
87113,Pretty straight forward to do assignments based on sample codes,4
87114,"This course has been a Godsend to me. I was so confused about so many things and all the other resources I could find out there just assumed that I knew things about which I was, in fact, clueless. I got the book and watched a lot of the lectures twice but in the end I really feel like I got it. The assignments were manageable and doable after the course lectures and I have gone back and done a number of them over again to solidify things in my mind. I feel like the web is my friend now, not a source of cheap tricks and booby traps. Thanks!",5
87115,"The course was a bit too shallow for me, the techniques shown are very basic examples of what can be learnt using stock python libraries (json, socket, urllib, ElementTree) or external (BeautifulSoup).I really expected something more, for instance authentication techniques, or methods to parse complex websites, rather or in addition to the basics shown here.",3
87116,Cool,5
87117,Simply Awesome!,5
87118,Learned basic steps and techniques to access web data,5
87119,Very fun and useful,5
87120,"I really enjoyed this course and found that I am feeling more confident with my skills from the previous two. However, as a point of improvement I would suggest making the final module a bit more challenging. Perhaps this was intentional but, although the final module introduces JSON well, I don't feel as though my skills improved while doing it. (Then again, the counter argument could be that it is good practice and repetition before moving on to anything too much harder...)",4
87121,Excellent !!! Its an easy course but I learnt a lot.,5
87122,"Useful contents, very concise.",5
87123,The exercises are very simple. It would have been great if there was a final project so that the student can see how to use what he/she learnt in a real application. The videos and the teaching are certainly good.,4
87124,"I liked it very much. Good style, do not go into useless details, focus on understanding, enough to start the deeper understanding on your own. Thank you!",5
87125,Great course !!,5
87126,Perfect and Useful Course so far,5
87127,"Great course! The reason why I didn't give 5 stars is that assignments are too easy. If we can resolve some real problems, that will be better.",4
87128,"I think this course has many introduction about the logics of Internet, but it's not so interesting as in the previous courses in the same specialisation.",4
87129,This course taught so much more than just Python and so elegantly. Thank you.,5
87130,Wonderful course ... learnt a lot and was not bored .. the amount of things to learn is just right. The assignments are fun.,5
87131,Excellent course! Python is powerful on the Web.,5
87132,"Great course, excellent to retrieve information from the Web.",5
87133,First step to crawl.,5
87134,Super useful course! I really liked the style of teaching. Thanks Dr. Chuck!,5
87135,Simply Great !!!,5
87136,Nothing short of being excellent!,4
87137,"This course strayed too far from its origins. Yes, this course contains topics that are nice-to-know, but they are by no means essential or useful.",2
87138,because of the details covered in it. The way everything is taught through explanation.,5
87139,Great course! I could recommend it for all...,5
87140,he provides clear explanation,5
87141,Python all the way baby!!:0),5
87142,Beautiful Course!!!! Now I know what is the API and i can do something with it. Thank you.,5
87143,it helps me build the basic foundation,5
87144,"This course has helped me learn the basics of regular expression and how to parse html, xml, and json data with simple exercises. After completing the course, I feel ready to apply what I learned to do more complicated tasks with the associated python libraries.",4
87145,"One of the courses that upon completing, leave you certain of your new capacities. Very rewarding and even entertaining.",5
87146,Good informative,4
87147,"Great course, especially when accompanied with book. The lecturer is great with nice sense of humour. Tho the fee is a bit too high.",5
87148,"Everything is perfect about this course. Topics are practical, examples are easy to follow and Dr. Chuck is a funny companion.Two suggestions to improve the course: to design bonus assignments that require more sophisticated and related Python applications; to give direction of going deeper in certain topics, such as leveraging Amazon API.Thank you!",5
87149,"Sometimes easy, sometimes hard. Learned a lot! Interesting how very simple programs can be used to interact so easily with API's like Google's or twitter.Excellent teacher!.",5
87150,Thanks Dr. Chuck.,5
87151,Great course~,5
87152,"Interesting, informative, and engaging.",5
87153,This course is phenomenal. I learned so much from this course. Dr.Chuck is one of the best professors you will find and is very entertaining to listen to.,5
87154,Great introduction to know how to access Web Data through XML and JSON objects.,5
87155,Loved the course. Learnt a lot about API and scraping.,5
87156,Good introduction for web scraping,5
87157,Thank you!,5
87158,Great course except it seemed little effort was put into explaining the python side of the week 5 and 6 material.,4
87159,Good introduction to web services.,5
87160,more content is needed.,3
87161,"Maybe it's great for beginner, but the assignment is too easy .",3
87162,Another great course in the specialization.,5
87163,"I've taken many online courses in technical fields and this course, largely due to the quality of the lecturer, is the best.",5
87164,Exceptional short course.,5
87165,After the first two courses this one seems to be much more difficult. Maybe some intermediate course is needed.,4
87166,Great information. Dr. Chuck is a great instructor.,5
87167,Clear,5
87168,Interesting,4
87169,Great class. It is very perfect for beginners.,5
87170,"Wonderful, as all the courses by Dr. Chuck!",5
87171,"Great professor, great class",5
87172,This course inspire me to think about what we can build to facilitate my work and life.,5
87173,Difficult yet rewarding,5
87174,"Dr. Charles Severance is by far the best Computer Science professor out there!!! I've done a significant amount of online Computer Science courses -as well as classroom courses back in college - and not one professor has been as fun and easy to understand as Chuck. He puts presents every topic in such a way that you're never scared off thinking ""i'll never understand this stuff."" He make computers and everything technical make sense. I've basically binge-watched almost every lecture/course he's headed up.I've always been a little embarrassed to say I code in Python when talking with professional Developers. I just thought it was an entry level language with limited capabilities. Now i'm proud to say i code in Python. I can't believe i can develop my on web browsers now.He makes learning fun and seems like he's be a really fun guy to get to hang with. Thanks Dr. Chuck for your love of teaching, you're the best!",5
87175,I can only recommend this course! The Professor is the coolest and explain all the stuff,5
87176,Great class. I like the pace and I am learning a lot of useful ways to use python.,4
87177,"Very useful course, lots of new features, especially with GeoJSON data retrieving6 stars from 5 =)",5
87178,Good lectures. Inspiring code examples and programming assignments.,5
87179,"Assignments are very easy, and there aren't easy to follow notes that one can use instead of always having to watch the videos.",3
87180,"One of the best online course out there on the Internet, It made accessing Internet using programming look so easy!",5
87181,"The course is well-organized and focused, and Dr. Chuck present it nicely with a lot of humour. I really like the way it get to the point while still providing all the information one needs to get going. Well done!",5
87182,"through this course , you will have a better understanding for web data",4
87183,"Challenging, but fun.",5
87184,Lots of food for thought . Great piece of data rich lessons. Thanks Dr Chuck :),5
87185,Great course!,5
87186,Good and useful course,5
87187,Excellent for introducing someone to programming in Python. In my case it was easiest to move from a language like C/C++ to learn Python.,5
87188,"Love this course. I took the first two (as one course), learned a lot (and worked really hard, since I started from scratch). But this one brings the coding part to the web and suddenly gives the whole experience a different dimension. Mind-opening. That's why I like it.",5
87189,"Very good material and instructor; just lacked on two things (under my point of view):1) Development of a simple webapplication to make the communication between webserver and client;2) Implementation of a socket and actually make the capture of a ""stream"" and translate (maybe opening the packets accordingly with the protocol);",4
87190,Thank you for teaching this wonderful course!,5
87191,Excellent videos with an engaging presentation. Very good assignments that were just the right difficulty!,5
87192,Awesome Course,5
87193,Great Course! Explained well.,5
87194,a little bit hard,4
87195,I really enjoyed i,5
87196,"All in all, I liked the class. I would like to learn about this topic and the database access using Python, and I still think this is a very good beginning. I like the enthusiasm of the instructor, but I think he short sells many of the things he is teaching. I would also suggest providing more challenging assignments, for instance, as optional ones. These may be such that they require reading the referred text in addition to watching the videos.",3
87197,Good course capturing the basics.,4
87198,"This course was very interesting to see the connection between Python and web applications. Learning about Browser,HTML, XML Json & API is very practical. Great Course and very useful.",5
87199,More assignments would help us more,4
87200,The form of presentation in the previous courses (video and slides simultanously) were better.,4
87201,"Great lecturer! Quiz and assignments are very easy to follow and finish, which keeps student engaged. Hope the programming assignments could be a little more challenging. But I guess that is left for the final project for the whole series.",5
87202,Great introduction to using techniques in previous course with online data.,4
87203,great introduction course. I wish you offered more advanced courses in python as well.,5
87204,This course is good for those people who has never program in Python. But for experience people there is nothing new in this course.I would really appreciate if1) the target audience is mentioned in a course it would be really helpful2) what a person would achieve after completion of a course .,3
87205,Professor Severance is a delight!,5
87206,"Dr. Chuck class is full of learning and fun. He leads us through everything in a logical manner thus even people who do not have a lot of experience with programming, even they find it easy to understand.",4
87207,"Great Course, you learn the basics very quickly",5
87208,Thing go deeper but you can also get the feeling i learned something usefull,4
87209,Loved this course. I had no idea python was so powerful. The python language truly represents power in its most simplest form.,5
87210,good times!,4
87211,Excellent introductory course for python and web data with some really cool examples.,5
87212,"Good as introduction course, but short of deep digging",4
87213,Great course! Doing the specialization,5
87214,"It was the most interesting course on Python for me. I started this to learn more about JSON and XML, but figure out how to parse websites and work with APIs. Everything was so clear and fun. Thanks Dr. Chuck!",5
87215,This is a great class. I thought the course work was fun to work through.,4
87216,This course is really very useful.The effort given by Dr.Chuck is very appriciateable and this course is very interesting as well because many great programmer told their history of discovered thing.,4
87217,"I have added Python to my resume, and now I am contacted by recruiters significantly more often than before.",5
87218,"thanks a lot, Dr Chuck",5
87219,I love this course! Dr. Chuck is an excellent instructor. I'm going to take more classes from University of Michigan.,5
87220,I like thi course,5
87221,"Enjoyed with this class, and Dr.Chuck is a really good instructor!",5
87222,Good explanation of the material.,5
87223,Thank you for teaching me!,5
87224,Great course,5
87225,5 stars! Would have given more if I had an option to do that.,5
87226,Useful feature for Python!,5
87227,"Nice but quite simple. And I missed the teaching of good pythonic programming style (something that is more than just script step by step but encapsulate functionality in functions, use advanced programming techniques, test your code and so on).",3
87228,This is a very good course. It is very well-explained and you feel that you finally start programming FOR REAL. I recommend it 100% for anyone who is trying to start programming!,5
87229,Lot of examples and theory well explained. Course includes suggestions where to look for further knowledge.,5
87230,a real pleasure to learn stuff this way!,5
87231,It's awsome,5
87232,Charles did an excellent job while describing and making a student much interactive in his class. He showed the learning in a very basic way and i personally enjoyed the class. Cheers to the python class :),4
87233,"Very well structured, very informative. It is great that is not going into great detail, but directs the students to more resources, and focuses on the gist of the concepts.Many thanks for this course, Dr. Chuck!",5
87234,Very good course for python enthusiast,5
87235,This course is great for beginners and Dr Chucky is very good teacher.,5
87236,"I enjoyed the lectures, and the overall focus on understanding the information, not such rigidity in structure of class, testing, time limits. This seems to be a better innovative freedom based way of learning that I seem to learn better within.",5
87237,Access web data is really a cool thing by using python and print it out .,5
87238,"Excellent, very interesting and well taught course. Takes a complex subject and makes it understandable and fun to learn.",5
87239,This phase of course about Python is dificult but amazing and I recomended to everybody start to learn this work. :-D,5
87240,Finished,5
87241,"I did the whole course over about 1 day. I was already familiar with Perl, Regex, HTTP, XML, JASON and web scraping, but totally unfamiliar with Python. Fortunately it did not rely on having done earlier Python programming basic parts too much. Will I do the other parts of Python for everyone? No, I think I would rather work and learn on my own problems.",4
87242,Good course ...,4
87243,Very interesting course. It revise central ideas of programming with python and other software technologies,5
87244,Great class. Dr. Chuck was fantastic as always.,5
87245,Really funny way to learn the bases of internet programming in Python.,5
87246,"It was an opening-mind course for me. I rated 5 stars because it helped me in my work place. So it is not just a good-to-know course, but actually it also built up your competencies.",5
87247,"Great course, great teacher.",5
87248,practical and awesome !,5
87249,"The pedagogy of this course is disappointing because of a lack of sequential instruction. Large gaps exist: explanations of syntax and conceptualization of how the data flows seem incomplete. I have looked at all kinds of documentation as well as the book, but I cannot find what I need to know, and this a barrier to completing the assignments. The instructor's videos have shown me very little of what I need to understand the concepts. The examples show at most 20% (that is just a guess, it is probably less) of the knowledge that I need to complete the assignments. When I ask questions on the forums, the first word I think when I read mentors' explanations is ""cryptic.""",1
87250,"Great course with good teaching, practice. And exams",5
87251,Great Course ! Great teacher! Thanks!,5
87252,Chuck is awesome. This course is very interesting and he does a great job explaining the concepts!,5
87253,thanks to dr.chuck for taking this course...he is really cool...and his way of teaching is awesome...i referred this course to my friends...they are really doing good...,5
87254,Third course in the specialization and it's only getting more exciting!,5
87255,Very well rounded and structured course!,5
87256,"This course felt a little light compared to the other ones in the series, I wish I could have learned more. Beautiful Soup was introduced as a way to do things, but not thoroughly explained as a package. I did appreciate the in-depth explanation of XML and JSON formats. Dr. Chuck is an amazing instructor.",4
87257,once again only matter the ability to make it simple,5
87258,"There were so many new libraries and concepts introduced in the last two chapters. It became a little bit confusing and overwhelming. Yes, a huge part of coding is picking up new tools on the spot, but it would be great to understand the fundamental theories behind how some of these libraries and concepts work at least once before being plunged into that reality! Also, I think that being overwhelmed could cause a lot of students to simply quit before they have really understood how the resources out there (documentation, etc.) could help them. Also, as the students start have to read multiple docs, etc. the time expectations per week should be increased.",4
87259,"Delivered just right. I actually got a good understanding of JSON and XML, and how to use them with Python through this course. Thank you for all the team, this has been a great experience!",5
87260,"A great continuation of the former course, it assumes that you now have a certain knowledge of the language but it gives you all the tools you need to learn the new contents.",5
87261,"The continuity and smoothness of the first two Python courses have been lost. From week 3 onward the assignments were badly worded, and that distracts the learning. People were trying to decipher the wording of the questions, not learning how to code. Lectures of later weeks were ""rushed"", very little buildup of understanding and I felt assignments were done for the sake of passing, very little were learned during those final 3 to 4 weeks. Effort were mostly wasted as little learning has been retained. May be there are topics that needed to be introduced for Course 4, will see, as I'll be doing straight after. The course overall is still very positive and the prof. clearly has put in a lot of effort and they are greatly appreciated.",2
87262,Dr. Chuck continues to be an awesome teacher and makes programming understandable and fun!,5
87263,Another great course by Dr. Chuck. I enjoy and appreciate his philosophical approach to teaching!,5
87264,Quite nice course. The atmosphere was very enthusiastic and the stress levels were at a minimum. Thanks!,4
87265,Its informative and easy for beginners,3
87266,"A bit more difficult than 2 courses of the same speciality placed before, but if you've finished them than it's still quite easy for understanding. I understood how web applications are working after completing it and even used API by my own. Nice course!",5
87267,"This is the second Coursera course that I have completed; although, I have enrolled in many. Dr. Chuck is one of the best MOOC professors that I have every encountered by far. This course and the quizzes/projects were challenging, but not intimidating. Typically, I have found a disconnect between the lectures/reference material and the quizzes/projects; however, Dr. Chuck has struck the perfect balance.",5
87268,"It was an experience for me for a lifetime ! I always dreaded about XML and JSON but this course to an extent removed the fear of XML & JSON of mine. I have to practice a lot in coming days to master XML & JSON and at the same time the Python module ""BeautifulSoup"".The course was just gorgeous and our instructor for this course is just great. This is the 3rd course on Python I completed successfully.",5
87269,Best teacher for a programming language..,5
87270,Fantastic teacher!,5
87271,very good to start your web data accessing career,5

87278,A nice course for beginners.Dr. Chuck is really humorous.,5
87279,Best Python Intro!,5
87280,"Jst the Best Teacher and an incredible course, cheers chuck! :)",5
87281,Dr. Chuck is awesome!,5
87282,Really a great course. Amazing.,5
87283,Thank you very much,5
87284,"Very good course to build on basic knowledge of python. Content is accessible, lectures are well presented and easy to understand. Using python for tasks such as web scraping shows the potential of python whilst still being fairly accessible for the majority of students.",5
87285,best teacher everthe programming tasks are actually a little bit too easy,4
87286,"This is a course where you will understand all about web, servers, web services, json, xml and other internet protocols and how to use Python to interact with these topics.",5
87287,All the best of REST and APIs seen through the eyes of Dr. Chuck and Python.,5
87288,This course sequence is one of the best. It really helps me to build up python from scratch.,5
87289,Another excellent and informative addition to the Python Specialisation Course. Builds upon previous knowledge seamlessly.,5
87290,Awesome course to be studied by everyone.,5
87291,"Dr. Chuck is awesome, learned so much in this course.",5
87292,The presentations flow well and have examples with which to work.Dr. Chuck (Dr. Severance) is lively and educational.,5
87293,Fantastic and Easy Class for Beginner.,5
87294,Awesome course.,5
87295,was fun learning,4
87296,Excellent course with excellent instructor!,5
87297,"If Charles Severance jumped off a bridge, I would follow him; writing Python on the way down.",5
87298,Need to add more examples and contents for this class. Homework is so easy,3
87299,Great and a lot of fun,5
87300,Very very good experience.,5
87301,With simple and clear illustration of the web structure as bonus,5
87302,"Excellent, exceeded my expectations",5
87303,Very useful class,5
87304,"It is good course, but I would like it to be in the more material and details of Python.",3
87305,Love learning python,5
87306,Great Course!,5
87307,"Took the first two courses which were fine but this one started off poorly and just got worse, unfortunately. I'm wondering if I can get my money back.",1
87308,Thanks for making studying so much fun!,5
87309,Gah! The second last assignment...for items in data['comments'] :Took me an hour to figure out that I needed to add that last bit in brackets! It just did the for loop twice each time...All the best!,5
87310,Very helpful if you want to learn how to deal with web data using Python. Dr. Chuck explains really well. Homeworks keep simple and focuses on the important concepts. Five stars!,5
87311,Grateful about taking this course and getting familiar with the hows of accessing web data and using web APIs. Clear explanation about essentials of SOA and how Python easily manages data serialization with JSON and XML,5
87312,This course covers a lot of ground at a pretty fast pace. It's not going to teach every aspect of the subjects covered--it couldn't possibly do so in the time--but it teaches enough to allow students to ask the right questions later.I would like to see more searching practical exercises to cement the learning. The existing assignments follow quite closely the worked examples which means those coding along with Dr chuck aren't going to have too much more to do.,4
87313,"Really, very good Course; you can learn more more details about web services",5
87314,good stuff. thanks!,5
87315,Thank you!,5
87316,"No teaching. Just a guy talking and sometimes complaining about imaginary students' hypothetical thoughts. Do the problem sets for practice. If you need help, pause the videos and try the code out yourself.Seriously though, a programming course where the teacher is not actively type out the code but just scribbling around it. He doesn't work through code but talks around the concepts.",1
87317,Dr. Chuck is the best teacher I have ever had.,5
87318,"Good initial overview to the topic. Most code is actually provided to the student, preventing deeper learning via trial & error. However, it is a tradeoff of making the course accessible to a large number of students versus being too challenging and preventing newcomers from enjoying the subject. Dr. Severance is excellent -- entertaining and clearly very knowledgable. For any novice programmers looking to understand how Python can be used to access the web and scrape its data, this is the best place to start.",5
87319,Dr. Chuck is the best!,5
87320,little more information of the supporting programs that we are using should be provided.,4
87321,Great Course!,5
87322,It's very practical and accessible for quick comprehension. Love the narrative style of the professor!,5
87323,Excellent way to step into the Python world!! Don't esitate join this course. But be aware that this is the third and you have to start from the first course (Programming for everybody).,5
87324,This Course was fascinating and introduces you smoothly to what happens behind the 'surfing the web' scenes as well as using Python to access and make use of web data (also demonstrates how cool Python is having all these built-in goodies).,5
87325,Excellent.But sad part is there are not many exercises and exams. Problem are some how simpler(!) not different from done in examples.,4
87326,"Simple, elegant and very useful ...",5
87327,Really useful to learn how to interact wit web resources from python,5
87328,Thanks for the clear explanation in the videos.Good course for beginners.,5
87329,very impressive.,5
87330,The course is great and it definitely left me wanting more content.,4
87331,"It's a very practical course. The course is in a good pace. The contents are broken into smaller pieces. Thank you Dr. Chunk for making Python+WebData easy and fun to learn. One little thing I wish was the slides and code could be shown for a longer time, or constantly showing on the screen as the two earlier python course. Currently I had to pause the video couple times to digest the slides or code.",4
87332,"Some typos in the assignments, but otherwise very straightforward course with good information. -1 star for not having python 3 ""support.""",4
87333,"The course sped through the coding portions while spending a lot of time on the theoretical side of how the Internet works. Overall a very helpful overview, but I would have liked to spend more time coding.",3
87334,"Although I've given 5 stars to the other classes of the specialization, I think this one beats the others in a big time.",5
87335,"Covers variety of topics in a very simple fashion.Good point to start for anyone, who is interested in subject.",5
87336,Easy to understand and a well - paced course.Thank you Dr. Chuck!,5
87337,It's great with all the material provided free in the course. It's really a nice professor!,5
87338,Great course! I wish json and soa topics were explored in more detail.,5
87339,Awesome Teacher,5
87340,Awesome classes. Good assignments.,5
87341,"learned a lot. From python regular expression, to open a file, read url data, web scraping, HTTP, XML, JSON.",5
87342,Very useful course!,5
87343,Good one :),4
87344,Very good start for sentimental analysis,5
87345,the course is good for the beginner's and provide the small great examples to help the students to understand the concepts to maximum.,5
87346,I'd like this course to be more difficult and i'd like it to have more practical exercises,4
87347,Dr Chuck is scaffolding step by step your skills in python in a cozy way.,5
87348,This course is pretty good.,5
87349,Great course and great teacher!!!,5
87350,Very interesting course and manageable and understandable content and curriculum.,5

87361,An excellent class. I learned a lot that will be applicable in real-world programming.,5
87362,"Another great course taught by a master. This class is perfect for anyone who wants to learn how to retrieve and read data from the web with Python. If you are new to programming, take the previous Python courses in this series since this course builds on concepts learned in those courses.",5
87363,"Great Course! Dr.Chuck, thanks for your passionate sharing.",5
87364,"This was a really great course, I enjoyed it a lot. A always wanted to write parsers on my own, and know, thanks to Dr. Chuck, I have the required knowledge base. I think that completing this course will really help me through my life. Thank you, Coursera and Dr.Chuck, for this fantastic opportunity!",5
87365,Thanks for course,5
87366,"Good course, things learned from this course can be easily applied to real application. However, it will even be better if more programming practices are provided.",5
87367,awesome professor and course materials. Dr. Chuck explained the contents really well.,5
87368,"The class is good, but the content in the class is not that much.I think more complex project to solve some interesting tasks in homework will be better.",4
87369,Amazing. The concept was broken into logical unit which made it easy to understand.,5
87370,Love the python specification so much and really make a lot progress.,5
87371,Lots of new things to learn. Beginners should complete the first two courses before attending this one.Excellent teacher and mentors.,5
87372,Great course. Dr. Chuck is great teacher.,5
87373,Just starting,4
87374,"Very Good class, thanks for making this course available for the world",5
87375,Basic project to learn deal with data through web.,5
87376,"A more challenging course, as to be expected in this stage of the specification. It would be interesting to know how much of the underlying code is working",4
87377,Perfect course.Perfect pace.,5
87378,"Great kick-off for what I am sure will lead the students to countless hours of solving ""puzzles"" with Python. I wished the assignments would have been a bit more challenging but they definitively fit the purpose.",4
87379,"easy to follow course. I've learned so much following these, the increments in learning are manageable each week.",5
87380,Speaker knows how to explain complex stuff in easy language. Very good intro.,5
87381,"Absolutely great course.This course has de-mystified the basics of accessing web-data and has atleast helped me realize the power of python to access it.Faculty, Well delivered ! you have kept the discussions lively and have made me eager to learn more.",5
87382,"Dr. Chuck is a ""GREAT"" teacher. :)",5
87383,"Hi there!It was fun to learn python! Thank you for teaching.Best wishes,Denis",5
87384,an amazing course!,5
87385,I'm getting coursera verification prompts too often. This doesn't happen in any of the other courses I've taken/I'm taking,1
87386,Great Course,5
87387,Dr Chuck makes Great JOB!!! Thank you Dr Chuck!,5
87388,Very nice course. Not to slow and not to fast.,5

87391,Again another good course! 5 stars!,5
87392,Great course! I had so much fun :),5
87393,"Nice, usefull knowledge!",5
87394,Cristal Clear...!!!,5
87395,For the third Course in the Python specialisation this is a very basic 6 weeks. The assignments are repetitive and you are pretty much spoon fed everything. If you are looking for a challenging course this is not for you!,2
87396,Very helpful topics...Best xml and json parsing lectures ever.,4
87397,"Useful, interesting lectures !",5
87398,It would be great if there were more practice. The theoretical material as always on top.,4
87399,I enjoyed this course the most.. best one in the specializatin,5
87400,"This course takes the student from beginner to novice. Easily the best course I've taken on Coursera so far. I'm also doing the Python for Everybody specialization and if you've taken any of Dr. Chuck's courses, you know he's hard to beat, but Dr. Matthew Yee-King did it.",5
87401,"(As always), Dr. Chuck rocks!",5
87402,Dr. Chuck is the man! Makes python cool.,5
87403,"In this course you really start using what you learned in the first courses. Dr. Chuck gives you just enough to get you started, but leaves enough out that the homework can still be a challenge.",5
87404,"Thank you for a wonderful courses ,Keep up the great work and surly one day its gonna change the education system.In India Many Educational Institutes are there just for business . So the one who need the real knowledge Surely gonna get through this. Thanks for such a wonderful and knowledgeable Course .",5
87405,"I liked this course very much! I love Python and now I use it almost every day! There is only one thing that costed me a little more time than others to get used to. I learned Python3 by myself because I was told that Python3 would be more popular. In this course I have had to pay extra attention to the grammar.Life is short, you need Python. Thank you Chuck! It has been great to learn Python with you!",5
87406,It was a fun but some of the assignments required deep thinking.,3
87407,Very interesting and a lot of fun with Dr Chuck.,5
87408,Wonderful course.,5
87409,"I found it to be a very useful class on important topics in web analytics. The homework assignments are not very difficult and encourage learning instead of grade-seeking. Plus, Dr. Chuck is an engaging instructor!P.s. I gave it 4 starts because the assignments were a bit too easy at times. My feedback is to include advanced but optional assignments in future sessions.",4
87410,"I prefer the format of the previous courses, where the video of the professor was in parallel to the notes/presentation and did not alternate between slides and video of the professor. It gives you more time to make your notes, and refer to the notes while the professor is talking.",4
87411,For those interested in XML and JSON is great!!!!,5
87412,"I have really liked the course and the way it has been presented. Although the course doesn't go into too much depth, it still gives a solid introduction to web data parsing and the available tools for the same. I strongly recommend this as a beginner's course.",4
87413,Outstanding Course for a newby. All about programming. Lectures and problems are clear and relate directly to the subject not related topics like statistics and other disciplines which add nothing to the Python and Python programming focus. Dr. Severance has built a great specialization here. Problems can be challenging but doable within the time frame represented by the course description (give or take a couple hours on some of the more challenging ones. I've learned alot! Thanks,5
87414,"Clear explanations, good assignments",5
87415,Very engaging instructor. Great pedagogy.Content of the course might be somewhat outdated.,5
87416,"Very applicable to real world development, but well thought out and executed for all levels to learn.",5

87422,"Great course! Quizzes are fair, assignments are perfect for learning the material.",5
87423,Thanks a lot for this course!,5
87424,very good and clear sessons,5
87425,"It was really helpful. I have 18 years of software development experience, but never learnt python and after going through this course, I could understand the power of it and how it can be used. I could learn the concepts very well and of course had to google to refresh myself, but its well organized and put together in a way we can learn easier and faster.Thanks to Dr Chuck. Sometimes your comedy was above and beyond, but at the end of the day, it was a good course and learned quite a bit.",5
87426,Dr Chuck is a great teacher.,4
87427,Pretty easy but that does not mean one does not learn anythonig from it. It means it is pleasant and not a too big workload.The instructor is really clear and fun. I recommend it just for that even if you are familiar with the topic.,5
87428,Great Course,5
87429,very interesting and well explained,5
87430,It's so much easier to learn more about python and data by taking this course.,5
87431,It is a great class,5
87432,All these courses really need to be updated to Python 3. There is no advantage in sticking to Python 2 anymore with Python4 on the horizon,4
87433,"Amazing course! It has a good pace, in terms of level of difficulty, it progresses really well! Dr. Chuck is an amazing professor and does a great job!",5
87434,Perfect,5
87435,Great course. Beyond basic knowledge of Python.,5
87436,The whole Python for Everyone Sequence is Awesome.Each of the individual sections has been exceptional.Section 3 of 4 - This course Accessing Web Data and Section 4 of 4 ( DataBase ) were the main reasons for me taking the course.I would highly recommend the Python for Everyone Series.,5

87471,Thank you so much for your lecture.I am so happy attending your course.,5
87472,great course,5
87473,"Loved it, it was hard, but i completed. Course needs some updates, there are few mistakes that took me longer time to complete tasks. And i liked the videos when it was Dr Chuck and desktop video in same video, it was more easy to keep along. Now it is harder when you concentrate on the code and then suddenly you lose your concentration when you see Dr. in full screen.",4
87474,Absolutely fantastic. Dr. Chuck's teaching style is completely in-sync with my learning style. The content is clearly presented and the effort in teaching shows. Thank you Dr. Chuck for taking the time to present this material and for creating the tools for all of us to use.,5
87475,Dr. Chuck's lectures are helpful and engaging. Without them I doubt I would be completing the lessons. My goal is to learn Python specifically to apply toward improving how we develop medicines for the pharmaceutical industry. I began taking Dr. Chuck's UM Coursera course after trying out codeacademy and preferred using my own version of Python and IDE rather than the web based compiler provided by codeacademy.,5
87476,"Dr. Chuck in one of the best profs I've ever had, even though I've never actually met him...",5
87477,One of the best courses available,5
87478,Enlightening! Can't wait for databases!,5
87479,"Awesome!!! I cannot believe that only a few weeks ago, I was an absolute novice, and now I am able to dig deep into live websites, drill deep, and extract specific information! Dr. Chuck is one of the best instructors I have ever seen!!!",5
87480,"This is very useful in data digging! Thank you Dr.Chuck, thank you everyone who contribute to this course!",5
87481,"This course was awesome. Dr. Chuck is by far, the best professor I've yet to come across, and the only one who taught in a way that I could comprehend. He makes the material easy and fun to understand, without too much hand-holding. I feel confident enough to complete assignments without feeling like I'm just parroting code and not learning anything. These courses are awesome and I can't wait to see what he's going to offer next.",5
87482,Very inspiring lesson through which I find I have more to learn!,5
87483,I like it!!! as always Chuck is clear and wise in make everybody undertand the contents of the course. thanks,5
87484,I'm very satisfied with this course. The course material was good. I covered my expectations.,5
87485,"Good course, want more info!",5
87486,for beginners is wary good :),4
87487,"Great class for those of us who taught ourselves, but need more. Great range of exercise difficulty.",5
87488,"This is a simple, practical course that will teach the basics of how to access web resources with python programs.The goal is not teaching you how to write nice programs, but just enable you to write something working to pull interesting data out of existing data sources like files and web services providing text, XML and JSON data.The videos also feature some interesting background.",4
87489,"I think this course is a really good overview of how to use Python to retrieve web data using the two most common data interchange formats: XML and JSON. Not only that, but you also get a brief yet good introduction to what XML and JSON are, as well as the basics of network communication and regular expressions. I was hoping the assignments would be a bit more challenging, but the free textbook provides additional exercises to practice with. As always, Dr. Chuck's style helps makes this course (and his other ones) a great one.",5
87490,Dr.Chuck's courses are fantastic! you can't miss it,5
87491,"The course provides useful knowledge. It's fun to learn with Dr. Chuck, he is a great teacher.Thank you for all the knowledge, I will definitely use it.",5
87492,"Simple, Concise, kind and fun explanations on web data access.",4
87493,"Dr. Charles seems like the coolest teacher ever. He also explains things in an understandable, yet, amusing way.",5
87494,I'm learning so much! Thanks,5
87495,csev is the best,5
87496,Great teacherGreat teaching methodologyInvaluable material,5
87497,"introduce XML and json with REST, nice for starter, if you expect more, read more related books",5
87498,it is easy,5
87499,"Great tutorials, explanations, starting code samples and assignments.",5
87500,"I like this course, but for me it was a little bit harder to understand some basic stuff. Ie, in JSON for me was confusing to hear ""a list of dictionaries"".Furthermore I didn't know what kind of operations I need to apply to them -- therefore I was checking for types of integers and even ""brute forcing"" a combinations of possible operations.As I have finished this course, I'l definitely check again previous chapters to build a better fundamentals in my head.Thank you dr Chuck!",5
87501,Hands down the best python course I've come across. I look forward to completing this series.,5
87502,Dr Chuck makes it look easy. Great teacher.,5

87505,An amazing course to learn how to program with Python accessing data from the Web.,5
87506,Fantastic stuff. Loving it. Thank you so much for putting the effort into providing this course.,5
87507,"I really like the simplicity of the overall program, makes it easy for even a beginner.",5
87508,"great energy and great class.1. nice assignment website, but it could use a bit file up-load and nosetest to held automate grading.2. I wish they have more web robot, crawling, interesting problem examples.3. peer review would be nice, so a better read-able pythonic programming style can be nurtured.4. wondering if the course grading website can be done in ipython notebook.4. I guess the instructor mention using RESTful, it could be also nice to have an assignment orproject to make a REST server with some database(sql-ed or sql-less).After all there a are lot of big data out there to be accessed and processed.",4
87509,"Loved this class. Perfect level of difficulty for me, engaging videos, and the material provides the right amount of info to get the assignments done without being too obvious. Dr. Chuck is really entertaining :) I am seeing more and more ways that I can apply this to my work and look forward to the continuing classes.",5
87510,Great code examples and insights by Profesor Severance,5
87511,"This course is awesome. Dr. Chuck's ""super"" explanation and lectures make it easier to understand stuff. Initially, I wanted to review a couple of videos but ended up completing all assignments.",5

87515,"Really useful, recommended to everybody",5
87516,"Very good content. The difficulty increases, but if you know the content of the two previous courses you can suceed!!!",5
87517,"It was Ok! The preofessor has a good style of teaching, but the depth of material could have been better and the assignments more challenging.",4
87518,Excellent Course for intermediate Python Developers. Really enjoyed it and definitely learned a lot.,5
87519,Very good presentation; takes small steps and shows examples of assigned work.,5
87520,Love it,5
87521,Good course.Thank you Dr. Chuck and Coursera.,5
87522,"Dr. Chuck is just awesome!He gives valuable information in such a very fun way. I love this class!Learn about scraping the web, APIs, REST architecture all that while strengthening python programming skills.Thanks Dr. Chuck!",5
87523,Very well done. The interviews are great.,5
87524,Awesome Class :),5
87525,Delivered in a simple yet effective way. And straight to the point. Useful to me,4
87526,"Another course taught by Dr. Chuck, maintaining same levels of quality and excellence as other courses. Recommended to get a better understanding of Python's capabilities.",5
87527,"A 5 star for Dr.Chuck' teaching, however, some more problems could be given :)",4
87528,"With this course you really feel that you are starting to do something real, that you may also use in your daily life...",5
87529,"Too easy for accessing web data, with many bonus.",4
87530,Great for everyone !,5
87531,Great ideas to improve the technical knowledges to scrapping web data,3
87532,"Awesome level of teaching by Dr. Chuck, many valuable theory about web. Interesting tasks. May be the best course within whole specialization. Thanks so much!",5
87533,Very interesting and useful,5
87534,The course is helpful.But there are not many practice exercises.It's quite easy.,3
87535,"More material, or coverage of the existing material with more library coverage would have improved the course.",3
87536,"The course is great although a little bit simple or slow-paced. But since it is for beginners I think it is Ok the way it is. You will learn the foundations of accessing the Web Data, so it is a really great starting point. You will enjoy and you will want to learn even more!Dr. Chuck is a great teacher whom I would loved to have at class. He explains things quite clearly, in a funny way and he transmits passion in what he is teaching.",4
87537,"Good course, but I might have used a little more rigor and material, maybe more exercises would have been nice.",3
87538,"Absolutely outstanding class, like all its predecessors. I'm extremely pleased with what I learned, and this helped give me the tools to make some progress on a side project I've been working on for several years.",5
87539,"Great course. The instructor is very senior, and makes the knowledge very clear and ready to understand. Further than that, he also shares a lot of hints that you can follow to dig deeper. I love this kind of teaching style.",5
87540,"Very good course for beginners. I liked the lectures, they were engaging and bonus videos are nice addition. Exercises were maybe too easy, but still for a beginners course just right. The only problem is there is less practical work than it should be, adding more exercises would be nice, and adding more difficult ones would help better grasp the material. That's why only 4 stars.",4
87541,"An extremely well-structured and useful course. As someone who had only syntactical familiarity with Python, this course taught me a great deal about the ease and power of the language. Moreover, the technical knowledge included (APIs, RegEx, etc) is highly relevant and practical.Given that it's part of an introductory series, the difficulty level of the assignments is understandable. But providing some more rigorous optional assignments can be a welcome addition to the course.That being said, I would recommend it to anyone looking to explore Python and the power it grants with its simplicity.",4
87542,This part 3 is more interesting than 1 and 2.,5
87543,I would like to thank Dr. Charles Severance for a very informative and easy to learn material. It was pleasant to go through this course.,5
87544,"It is a really good course, the video classes are really clear and the topic is very useful.",5
87545,Very good teacher/instructor.,5
87546,"Easy to follow , nicely constructed",4
87547,Its bit tough to me actually...But lecture was so good....,4

87549,Just Awesome!,5
87550,This course is good for both novice and expert in Python. Lots of new things to learn.,5
87551,Good class - estimated effort is appropriate - and the teacher has humor.,5
87552,It was fun to expand my python knowledge. Thanks...,5
87553,Great Course! I've learned a lot from the class.,5
87554,Dr. Chuck is awesome!,5
87555,"Dr. Chuck is an exceptionally-inspiring teacher. He explains complex concepts like XML, JSON, HTTP, API, RegEx in such an eloquent and down-to-earth fashion that despite having the videos at x2.0 speed, I can grasp everything he tries to deliver. Amazing! This course, and many other Dr. Chuck's courses, are really how online courses should be. Excellent instructor, fair share of hands-on programming assignments.However, I just hope that there are many more programming assignments, maybe many optional challenging, extensive programming assignments or even projects would be an ultimate Coursera experience.",5
87556,good course,5
87557,i'm enjoying python and dr chuck's style of teaching more and more. thank you very much!,5
87558,"It was Amazing! Thousands thanks to Dr-Chuck, fellow classmates & of course all these great people in the bonus videos.I have started my programming adventure with Dr-Chuck and now there is a burning desire to keep going. It is highly recommended to get this course.All the best,Sinan.",5
87559,Great learning experience.,5
87560,"Thx, Dr. Chuck!",5
87561,It is a very good course with book. The only think is I would like to have a more complex exercises. Most of them are just to modify some given code,5
87562,Assignment Doings felt not that good as the courses before.,3
87563,I learnt so much in this course just as in all the previous courses.Thanks Dr. Chuck!,5
87564,Dr. Chuck makes learning and using Python to 'non-trivial' Web -access tasks so easy I would not have believed is possible. This course gives kick-start for your own attempts to conquer Web.,5
87565,"Great Course, Learnt a lot !!!",5
87566,I recommend this course to anyone who wants to program in Python.,5
87567,Great course and thank for all of you.,5
87568,"easy to understand, very suitable for online learners.",5
87569,"Everything good explained, even if u would be a beginner. Earlier it took me much time to learn these concepts from different sources in web. Dr Chuck explaines this all (call webservises per APIs, JSON, XML, XML schemes etc) in a very vivid manner in this collection of videos. Recommendable.",5
87570,Best teacher I've had so far on Coursera.,5
87571,A quick overview of some really fun tools!,5
87572,This is one of the most amazing Python courses I have seen!!,5
87573,Charles Severance is perhaps the greatest instructor of a programming language that I have ever encountered. Not only are the lectures engaging but the assignments are relevant and I have been able to apply what I have learned immediately to my day to day life.,5
87574,"I had a little bit of knowledge about Python coding before taking these courses, but it was very insightful and helpful in my quest to learn more and helped instill the things I did already know.",5
87575,Fun course that was challenging and very useful.,5
87576,Strongly recommended!,5
87577,Very much enjoying the course so far! Am glad this topic is so well handled.,5
87578,"Great teacher, with a great sense of humor.",5
87579,It's awesome to learn retrieving data from web!,5
87580,"I've taken a number of courses on Python through Coursera and this was the first course that I was able to follow through to completion, and I believe that is a combination of Dr. Chucks teaching style, and the activities he uses to convey the information. It was amazing to learn about things like using APIs and mixing python with Databases in a way I could understand at my level of programming knowledge, and it enabled me to start thinking about my own projects in a completely new way.I'm really looking forward to completing the capstone project.",5
87581,Great!!!,5
87582,Absolutely brilliant,5
87583,Great course on web scrapping.,5
87584,This class is not challenging at all,2
87585,thank you dr.Chuck! this is an amazing class,5
87586,Excellent course. The last 2 lessons on XML and JSON could have used a little harder problems for exercises.,5
87587,"excellent! educational, entertaining and enjoyable",5
87588,Great course to get you started with web scraping.,4
87589,Fantanstic and recommended!,5
87590,Very good introduction to python and its application to access web data. Dr Severance makes the process fun and easy to access. I would maybe have appreciate more complicated assessments.,4
87591,"Very good introductory course to learn how you can code to get data from web using different constructs i.e. web crawling, web services, json api etc. Also introduce reg-ex and other programing construct to process the data from web.",4
87592,Wonderful course. Takes in depth on course content. I liked the extra interview videos and assignments!,5
87593,"Great Professor, great course!!!",5
87594,"Fantastic course! I was vaguely familiar with XML, APIs, web services, etc. prior to taking this course, so this laid everything out in an organized and logical manner with good explanations, great textbook/slides, and good exercises.",5
87595,"Excellent course, very interesting and challenging!",5
87596,"Good lectures, good assignments and good professor.",4
87597,"If this course has given more related reading material, it would be perfect.",4
87598,"This is a good course if you are interested in getting to know how to parse html data and xml/json data using python libraries. The techniques you learn can be immediately put to use to do some really cool things with existing APIs like the twitter API, or that of Google and so on.",4
87599,"This course builds on knowledge gained from previous two courses in Specialization, so it can be taken without taking previous two given the participant has enough programming knowledge. The assignments are practical and content very well explained by great instructor. This course provides an example of using python in real-world small applications.",5
87600,Very interesting,5
87601,Thanks for this course!,5
87602,This was an amazing course. Would recommend it to anyone looking to further their programming knowledge.,5
87603,"I like this course so much. Not only this one, but the whole series. I learned a lot and I feel myself into Python now. The lectures are great, so are the examples and tricks.",5
87604,awesome course,5
87605,"Excelent course, it teaches you how to extract the online data with python, and the different types of data avaible.",5
87606,Great comprehensive course for web developers interested in Python.,5
87607,Actually a good course.,5
87608,The course is well organized and touch on topics that matter in the real world.,5
87609,Very accessible and a clearly knowledgeable professor. Materials and pace is great for a beginner to programming or someone looking to learn a new language.,5
87610,Lectures were very informative and sample code was provided for studying.,5
87611,Thank you Dr. Chuck,5
87612,"Great course. Good workload to do the course in the evening, after a workday.Highly recommended!",5
87613,overall covered a lot of interesting material - hope to see more classes that dive deeper into webscraping and not just getting at the basics,4
87614,Well done Professor Chuck and team! thank you once more for this awesome learning experience!,4
87615,This is an excellent course; good pace and amount of material.,5
87616,"I really enjoyed the course and found it cool how you can write python scripts to act like browser. However the API stuff (especially the twitter one) seemed kind of vague to me, since I don't have twitter.",4
87617,"This session is the most interesting one since I enrolled this series of Python program studying. The technology I learned here opened the door of using Python to organize and catch data from web. There must be big land behind and I want to pay a visit, by additional work after this.",5
87618,Learning from Dr Chuck is great.,5
87619,"Yet another excellent course... My prior reviews were so ravingly positive that I now feel compelled to offer a very minor area of potential improvement: Dr. Chuck might have considered going a bit deeper into Geojson API and perhaps even done a second API. Also there were some glitches in the Geojson assignment: My python Spyder was left frozen a couple times before I got things working.I understand that some students would have complained due to the length of Week 6, but if you requested the simple first assignment completion after the first 10 minutes of video lecture, you could have snuck in two concrete API assignments later on. Also, you could have had a Week 7 with the second API and alternate Web Access assignments. In sum, I was left wishing I had a bit more API experience.Nevertheless, I give this class 4.75 stars, which rounds up to the usual 5 stars. I've completed three of Dr. Chuck's classes and I'm on the fourth. Dr. Chuck is the incarnation of the super MOOC professor. Long live Dr. Chuck!",5
87620,"As always, Dr. Chuck makes learning this material fun and interesting. Nice to be getting to some good, hands-on, stuff after learning the foundational material. Thank you Doc!",5
87621,The information is presented is really easy to understand useful. I wish I could dr Chuck teach more complicated subject like algorithm !!!!,5
87622,This course is a great introduction to web programming using python.,5
87623,Very good and fantastic,5
87624,"Great introduction to web scraping, basically teaches you what you need to start doing web scraping on your own. Only remark, why teach urllib instead of requests? requests seems to be the better library.",4
87625,"Good course, I think Charles should avoid explaining the code so in detail sometimes that makes the course pace very slow",4
87626,"Excellent. A little short on the exercises, but its my turn to experiment with code and keep practicing.",5
87627,I found the course most enjoyable and the material all meat and no fluff - it taught exactly what it set out to teach - impressed,5
87628,thanks to the best faculty ever!!!the course was very informative and all the concepts were well explained.,5
87629,"We want some details in lecturings, thank you",4
87630,Its a nice course. To the point assignments(could have been tougher !). Lucid explanation. Please go ahead and take it.,4
87631,Extremely useful and relevant for today's technology,5
87632,Thank you!,5
87633,Another great course offered by Dr. Chuck!,5
87634,thanks!,5
87635,"Its great course. I am enjoying it. Right now I am in week 2, so cant tell more than this. But, I really like the way this class is going on . Thanks for this course!",5
87636,Thorough and comprehensive course with many worked examples. The additional material is very interesting!,5
87637,The lectures are clear and the practical assignments are very nice!,5
87638,Awesome! Every single detail is well explained.,5
87639,Complicated stuff. But instructor make it easy and fun to learn.,5
87640,this course is really hands-on and immediately usable in (beginners) projects. Dr. Chuck's enthousiasm and 'simple but effective' way of teaching made me feel a bit like a programmer after 3 courses. Currently doing course 4!,5
87641,"very inteserting course, not only about python and great introduction to internet protocol and how web service works from a coding perspective ! very useful and it is one of the best class attained on Coursera!!!! Thank you prof",5
87642,Fun course! Charles is very entertaining and engaging,5
87643,Excellent introduction to accesing and manipulating data from the web or other sources. Light load of lectures and easy assignments it can be completed in a few hours and allows you to wrestle further complexities on your own.,5
87644,Great python course! I recommend it to all.,5
87645,"I though parsing xml or json is much complex, but with python libraries its awesome!",5
87646,Great course following on from Python Introduction. Fascinating interviews along the way!,5
87647,"With other courses, I was having the feeling I was going nowhere. With this one I am enjoying it a lot because we are actually doing fun things, like accessing a web page and extracting information that can be used for whatever else. Extremely practical! :)",5
87648,"Assignments were too easy, and were really ""fed"" to us. Also, I liked better the setting in the previous course where Dr. Chuck was in his office and we always saw his screen.",4
87649,Very good course! Thank you Dr Chuck!,5
87650,easy to follow at a good pace.also comes with home work assignments that make sure you can apply the code.,5
87651,Very Very knowledgeable and real life usable information are taught. Simply awesome,5
87652,Useful stuff. Room for more difficult assignments.,4
87653,"A very nice brief course that introduces a lot of useful tools, libraries, and techniques to access the data on the Internet.",5
87654,Dr Chuck takes you step by step through the process of accessing data from web pages and services. Clear and detailed.Everything you need.,5
87655,Very clear explaination and useful. Good for beginners.,5
87656,good overview on web scraping using python,4
87657,A very good intro to how to use Python to access web data. I loved it!,5
87658,"Professor and course are great. However, I feel that there weren't enough practice questions to bolster our understanding of the material and the lessons were spread too thin.",4
87659,A must if you are learning web programming.,5
87660,Thank you. Dr. Charles Severance and the University of Michigan.Excellent course and very learning of easy.,5
87661,Love this course and learning a ton!,5
87662,I worked with Python in 2001 for my first job at a hedgefund company. It was refreshing to work on the basics of the language and to refresh syntax and new libraries. Python is a powerful language and Dr. Chuck has made it easy for beginners as well as for advanced members to quickly get up to speed.,5
87663,excellent and practical application of the subject matter.,5
87664,Fantastic! Learned a lot and felt much of what we learned was very useful to understanding and being able to apply the concepts taught.,5
87665,The assignments could be harder.,5
87666,The course was great! The tasks could have been a bit more complex and demanding.,5
87667,"Very interesting, Thanks",4
87668,Good Stuff. Keep it coming!,5
87669,(from someone in a non-computer field) Dr Chuck does a fantastic job of simplifying explanations of how python interacts with online data. This course is a great followup to the earlier python for everyone series.,5
87670,"That was one of the most interesting courses. It's amazing what you can do with this language, the web data you can manipulate. It's awesome.",5
87671,Nice course !Clearly show us the knowledge and skills of python xml json and etc,4
87672,Another outstanding course with Dr. Chuck! Highly recommended for everybody who is interested in Python.,5
87673,Great Course!Fine videos and lectures.Good examples.Easy assignments!,4
87674,awesome... thank for everything ! i learned a lot !,5
87675,Awesome Course. Learnt a lot on how to use Google API's. Dont have knowledge on the JSON or XML but this gave me a brief intro of everything i need. Big Thanks to Professorrrr!!!,5
87676,"Continuing with the experience I had with the previous course, the content is exceptionally delivered to ensure maximum uptake by students. Professor Chuck rocks...!!",5
87677,easy but useful,4
87678,Dr. Chuck is simply an amazing teacher!,5
87679,very very basic course looking forward to advance version of it.,3
87680,OK course but easily forgettable! Maybe more fun and practical exercises would not harm.,5
87681,Well constructed course.,5
87682,"Very good, learnt a lot. Would be even better if this also covers Python 3.",4
87683,Great course!,5
87684,Thank you for the great course!Really appreciate your way to explain complex things in a simple manner!Recommend for everyone to subscribe the Dr. Chuck's courses!,5
87685,This was very interesting to me as I have only used Python in stand-alone programming situations.,5
87686,Good course. Nice introduction to pythonweb tools. Cool explanations.Highly advisable,4
87687,dr.Chuck is the best),5
87688,Wey easy for the person with some python experience but the best part is that takes only hours to complete all assignments and quizes,3
87689,thx for bringing the course. Loved the content delivery and challenges in the terms of assignments,5
87690,Actually I think I need more homework and practice.,5
87691,I personally find this course usefull. It teaches good current toolsDr Chuck is a very motivating guy.In order to get better the course needs more exercises,4
87692,Very nice course! Thank you Dr. Chuck!,5
87693,"Excellent teaching and quizzes and assignments, this is a interesting course.",5
87694,A wonderful course!,5
87695,"I really like this course. I was able to learn several useful concepts to retrieve data from the web. I like the assignments, there are needed to practice and see the potential use of the material class. Lectures are very easy to follow with several examples that help you to remember previous concepts. Maybe I would like to see more examples!",5
87696,"It's amazing, very organized, easy to follow and fun!",5
87697,The teacher allows understand the basic concepts through element examples. It's a great course.Thanks.,4
87698,"Very Good,",5
87699,"A very good course, but not as good as the first two in this specialisation.It could do with a bit of editing and strengthening the last 2 exercises.Other than this, Dr Chuck is an excellent teacher and great fun to follow.",4
87700,Very well explained. Plenty of learning material.,5
87701,Great course with ready to run exercises which can be customized very quickly to your needs.,5
87702,Well refined lectures and wonderful resources.,5
87703,"An amazing course content!! This is a very enjoyable course about Python language programming. Dr Chuck explains each topic with clarity, which facilitate the comprehension of Python from the beginning. In my personal point of view, I would like to have a more deeply exploration in topics. It could give more tools to learn and complexity to each assignment. The book as supported material is a very good resource for consult through all course.",4
87704,Good course. It expands on the basics learned earlier.,5
87705,Dr. Chuck is so nice and this course will not even be boring bcs of his fabulous teaching! Really learn a lot of useful stuff of Python after this class set!,5
87706,"Awesome Lectures...Thank you, Professor..",5
87707,"It was a great course but I felt that the exercises could have been a bit more tough. If the exercises were challenging, then it would be a great way to learn the principle of Read-Search-Ask.Thanks, Dr.Chuck. Looking forward to Databases with Python course.",4
87708,very easy to follow and very useful,5
87709,"This course teaches the ""why"" and the ""what"" as well as the ""how"" to gather data from around the web. Particularly excellent is the web service through API's.",5
87710,Dr. Chuck is an awesome educator and his passion to develop and expand MOOCs to address our outdated education system is inspiring.,5
87711,"Very nice course and very well organised. The only thing I have to point is that I expected a little bit harder. Nevertheless perfect. It is very good to have all the classes ready at the beginning, so one can take its own rhythm.",5
87712,"The instructor and the material actually help you learn, instead of just throwing you in the deep and expect you to figure it out.",5
87713,One of the best courses ever!,5
87714,Good course.Gives a clear view on the way websites and API's work.,5
87715,"Very practical. Chuck's is the best at explaining things. Very simple, useful and hands on.",5
87716,"This was a short but very good introduction to APIs and Python's ability to retrieve data from the web.The load is quite low, so my suggestions to the teacher would be: make it harder! Include more examples and make both quizes and assignments harder in the same amount of time.",5
87717,Yet another fantastic course in the specialization where I learned a lot!,5
87718,This covers techniques to harvest data from online sources. A common first steps in many projects.,5
87719,"One of the best features in online courses compared to self-learning is pseudo interactive environment through video-lectures. So whenever the professor is capable of providing short, compelling and attractive speech, it's really great. Any reduction of reading means reducing the work of learner. this point is more obvious in programming courses.This course in this term does great.",5
87720,"A very interesting professor! This is my second course in this specialization, and it is possibly I'll take the SQL one as well. However it is too easy. Students still have to take some time learn the modules themselves.",4
87721,Another excellent Dr. Chuck course!,5
87722,"Again, thanks for Proj. Charles with the useful course!",5
87723,This course really teaches me what I wanted to know. Text and sample codes are wonderful. I think it's easier now for me to step up. Thank you.,4
87724,"This is the third course I have taken from Dr. Chuck, and I have loved them all. His teaching style matches my learning style and I find Python to be an easy to learn and easy to use language.",5
87725,Great course,5
87726,"Very good course, I would like to have seen some more challenging assignment. Other than that, very stimulating and learned a lot about web protocols and data.",4
87727,The professor does a great job of explaining the content in an easily understandable way and is very practical. The assignments require very minimal adjustments to sample code from the lessons so this is far easier than a typical course or say the EdX MIT intro to python course. I came in feeling comfortable in rudimentary python and leave now feeling a lot more prepared to use those skills manipulating the web and calling APIs.,5
87728,"Extremely good explanations as all courses in the specialization (sometimes much too well explained, as the course targets complete beginners). Additionally, it provides a lot of value by effectively stringing a series on mini courses on specific standard Python libraries, which is something not found everywhere:* the regular expressions library* libraries for web communication (socket and urllib)* parsing HTML (beautiful soup)* data transfer libraries (XML and JSON)",5
87729,Thank You! Very excited about the next course!,5
87730,Fantastic Dr. Chuck course - by far the most motivating course I went thru on coursera.Well do to Chuck and Congratulation to your (behind the curtains) team for their work too.,5
87731,Dr. Chuck as allways makes me feel myself smarter than I thought before his courses.,5
87732,"Dr. Chuck is a brilliant teacher. The Python for Everybody Specialization is perfect for absolute beginners. Between the video lectures and the textbook, I was able to practice each concept until it made sense to me. I have absorbed a phenomenal amount of vocabulary without feeling overwhelmed. Dr. Chuck has boosted my confidence that I can learn this new skill, enjoy every moment of the process and... dare I suggest... get a job!",5
87733,Fantasti! It has been a lot of fun learning.,5
87734,"Amazing course, specific and thorough lectures- learned a lot and had fun!",5
87735,"Very well designed and organized courses. Best mentor Dr. Charles Severance it perfectly explains the study material for those who are in the first encounters with the technology of programming computers.Personally, I'd add that this course helped me understand the programming language Python.Regards Dmitry",5
87736,Great course!I mainly loved it because it does leave some things for the learner to be figured out and does not spoon feed the answers to the assignments!The videos are really fun to watch as well!Thank you!,5
87737,"Definitely, the best web data course for novice python learners!!",5
87738,Great course covering many important features of modern development,5
87739,Instructor makes easy to learn Python!!!,5
87740,"Thanks Dr Chuck for a perfect, easy and interesting course. All topics that were discussed contain source code that is self described and easy to understand. I recommend this course to everyone who wants to learn something new. Many thanks to Dr Chuck and all people who make this course open to everybody. And thanks Coursera also :)",5
87741,"very fun course to learn, a slightly advanced level course after this(doesn't matter included in this specialization or not) will be great!",5
87742,Dr. Chuck is great teacher! I really learned the material of the course!,5
87743,Simply loved it,5
87744,"So far i haven't found a professor such as Dr Chuck who via his videos makes it both entertaining and engaging to learn about programming as well as technology in general, i highly recommend his courses for any beginner!",5
87745,Great Course. But assingments were to easy to do... :),4
87746,It's a great course with many activities to help solving real neccesities.,5
87747,"I liked this course a lot, even I wasn't really a beginner for Python. I learned some really cool stuff!Maybe one minor improvement could be to also use the learned things from Week 1 (regular expressions) even in the other assignments. I found regular expressions a really interessting topic but missed them a bit in the rest of the course.",5
87748,Super course. I've already used some information from this course to make my work-life easier :-),5
87749,The professor teaches with utmost zeal !!,5
87750,"It's fun to watch the videos, and the learning process is very enjoyable. Thanks.",5
87751,So good its invaluable,5
87752,Very useful class - all topics a relevant for retrieving data over the web,5
87753,"Very interesting course. But, so fast. I think it could cover more tools.",4
87754,Great,4
87755,"a good introduction to retrieve pages and (de)serialization of JSON and XML using Python modules, ending with an introduction to APIs.",5
87756,"It's an easy course, but good to get into more advance python's stuff",4
87757,Great job!,5
87758,I am glad.. this is a second Python course with Dr. Chuck and University of Michigan. The courses has been very useful and i have applied it in another programs that use python for to develop scripts.Thanks..,5
87759,"Course had pretty good basic information for people not familiar with programming. I would like to have seen more in-depth tasks or project(s) that would require deeper exercise of the topics covered in class. Each assignment boiled down to parsing a file using specific method (reg ex, Beautiful Soup, XML, or json libraries) to do the same task. Requiring people for instance to build additional data types already taught (lists, dictionaries) would have been at least little more challenging.Overall it is a good basic intro class.",3
87760,Was great to start seeing how python can be applied to scraping web data,5
87761,"Pretty interesting course, in which I gained a lot of knowledge about access web with Python.",4
87762,"Great Course, very informative.",5
87763,"Using Python to Access Web Data, like its two prerequisites, is a five star couse. It was fun, like the name of the course, to use Python to access web data. I did not know that before. It was a little harder than the two prerequisites, but it was a good course. Thank you, Dr.",5
87764,"i had no knowledge in web api. After this course, I feel confident now to go out and start using all the APIs out there and build my own python application",5
87765,Dr Chuck - a computing professor with a sense of humour - won me over in the end. This doesn't ask too much. It's clearly set out and you get to have a little go at programming at the end of each session. This course highlights how easy Python is more than anything and that's a good thing. Good coding language for beginners. Good course for beginners or novices.,4
87766,Learned a lot. Python is ok.,5
87767,"A few glitches in the assignment content, but overall pretty good.",4
87768,Good course!,5
87769,well course,5
87770,"Great course, great instructor! I've learned a lot, but the assignments are a little easy.",4
87771,highly recomended,5
87772,"Cool, enjoyed this course a lot!",5
87773,Very good course,5
87774,Another great addition to the specialization!,5
87775,"Excellent course, with the right balance between depth and affordability. The bonus interviews are amazing.",5
87776,"Awesome program, well structured, well lectured, student-focused and challenging engaging while making all the hard parts easy to grasp and understand to the novice/entry level student. A+++",5
87777,Great course but need to be updated to Python 3.x rules,3
87778,Great course and even though the topic was more interesting then the previous 3 courses (interesting as in fun) I didn't like the new format where Dr. Chuck wasn't in a picture-in-picture frame so that we could always see the slides and him at the same time. Many times the slides would cut out to him and it was very distracting as I'd have to pause and go back.,4
87779,The course provides a fabulous overview of using Python to access web data sources either via a scrape and search of HTML or via XML/JSON data provided by an API. The course builds on the previous two courses in the sequence; if you have completed those then I suspect you can continue your journey with Python.,5
87780,"pretty cool to learn python from Dr. Charles, i wish to learn more advanced courses on python from him.",5
87781,"Simple and fun to learn, especially for beginners.",5
87782,Good Course!,5
87783,"Practical hands-on real life examples, excersises and assignments!",4
87784,"It appears, during this course I'm becoming hungry for Python programming. Somehow weird but also very attractive programming language. Especially when I succeed in doing something in so called ""pythonic"" way. And thanks to professor. It's a real pleasure to listen to his lecture.",5
87785,It is a good class!,5
87786,"Lectures were entertaining, but the assignments were way too easy.",3
87787,The material covered is more complex than the previous courses yet there is much less explanation given. It's still perfectly doable but one ends up feeling like you are missing something.,3
87788,"One of the best courses that I have taken! Thank you so much for this course. I was out of touch in coding, and wanted to get back to programming and learn a new language like Python. The step-by-step explanation, availability of sample code and the le",5
87789,"very useful, practical!the assignment and material is well designed with all heart.",5
87790,"Finally understand a bit about what is API.Again the lectures are very clear.Comparing to the previous two courses on python basic, this one teaches some cool stuff one can do with python.Also the lecture does not take much time. I could finish the entire course (videos and exercises) in two weeks next to a full time job.",5
87791,Brilliant Teacher!,5
87792,Material 5/5Instructor 5/5There is none better than Dr Chuck and University of Michigan for learning python on-line.,5
87793,It is a very useful course with a brilliant Dr. Chuck . I am grateful with him an,5
87794,Lots of fun. Great teacher.,5
87795,Great course. Useful. Very easy assignments which could be done by a child.),5
87796,"This course is one of the best I've taken on Coursera. The lecturer is engaging and makes the subject matter interesting and clear. The exercises are considered and related to the lectures, so can be completed without pain or massive amounts of prior knowledge. It's a course for anyone wanting to brush up their Python - I recommend it!",5
87797,Learn some useful stuff,5
87798,Dr. Chuck is the best!,5
87799,Charles Severance is a truly exceptional teacher. I learned a lot about how to access web data and engage with API's. Loved the course.,5
87800,Very helpful to understand the python APIs to access the web data and how to parse the XML and JSON formats. The course presentation was friendly and easy to follow. The assignments were covering the python in detail. Overall very useful and highly recommended.Thank you.,5
87801,It would be much better if the difficulty of programming homework is harder.,4
87802,Professor Chuck is the best! And this course is very helpful too!,5
87803,"Very solid. Good material, and I learned quite a lot.",4
87804,Brilliant course. Loved the way Python can access web data so easily in few lines of code. Thanks Dr. Charles and team (Y),5
87805,Very good course,5
87806,"Professor is good and funny, and subject is interesting, but that's all. Very basic course, very easy to follow and not at all challenging. Also (maybe because being that easy), peer review is compromised by people who doesn't really know what they're doing there, with comments that were clearly made without any knowledge about the subject.",2
87807,"Phenomenal. My second completed course with Dr. Chuck as of now, and I cannot wait for the Databases course. This man is not only passionate, but knowledgeable and energetic as well. His courses are the perfect amount of content, and the presentations are always thorough and applied.Can't say enough good things about the instructor and the course in general. Python newbie to intermediate user thanks to Dr. Chuck -- I love it.",5
87808,Too much unnecessary videos. Content of lectures is poor. Tests are too easy.,3
87809,It's awesome! After this course I can claw lots of data on the internet,5
87810,"Execellent to learn logic of web data, html and xml parsing. :)",5
87811,Awesome course !! Learned alot,5
87812,Easy to learn. Encourage me to learn more courses.,5
87813,"I really enjoyed this course, and the Programming for Everybody (Python) that I took before this. Dr. Chuck has a unique way of explaining things, that makes his classes interesting and fun to take. Keep up the work Dr. Chuck!",5
87814,Great course. I could go a little further on javascript.,5
87815,"Clear, Easy to follow, Practical",5
87816,"The material is well explained, but there is not much of it... It is very very basic... The tasks, being extremely easy, don't really bring you further in understanding either.",3
87817,I really enjoyed this course and Dr. Chuck. Can't wait for the next one.,4
87818,"Course is thoughtfully put together. The assigned work is sufficiently hard for a class at this level, and the teacher provides great resources to review the class material.",5
87819,This is the second class I have taken with professor Charles Severance on Coursera. Love the flexible schedule and clear lectures/assignments. Thanks a lot professor Charles Severance.,5
87820,great course! I am seasoned programmer and learned a lot about python in this class,5
87821,"Thanks so much Chuck, I've learnt so much through the Python courses.Made me fall in love with Python.",5
87822,"I found this course very useful and learnt how use of regular expressions and later used them to parse HTML pages to look at various tags and content. The use of urllib and BeautifulSoup make my life easier to scrape webpages. Finally, I learnt how to parse XML and JSON.Again, Thank you Dr Chuck and your team for creating such an interesting and exiting course. I have thoroughly enjoyed this.",5
87823,"Excellent introduction into accessing and scraping web data with Python.Professor Chuck is very good at explaining things and the code snippets provided were just enough to get you started on your own.Previous experience in Python is required. If you are coming from the first four Python for Everyone courses, you will find this one a noticeable step up in difficulty. This course uses Python 2 but I personally did all the code in Python 3 – it's possible, but be prepared to make changes and look up differences in modules between 2 and 3.My co-students were also really helpful on the forums, although the rule not to post your source code makes trouble shooting difficult and laborious.The one thing I found missing was the professor instructing and engaging you more on how to read and make use of documentation. It's a core skill for a programmer! With all the Python modules used in this course (Beautiful Soup, ET, XML, JSON) you are bound to come across situations where reading the documentation will open up many new pathways and enhance your understanding.All in all a fun learning experience. Would recommend. A big thank you to Dr. Chuck & all the visible and invisible staff members who made it possible.",5
87824,"The course is short but so much fun! I learned a lot from the course material as well as the interviews with those big names in CS. Great job, Dr Chuck!",5
87825,"Dr Chuck rock the MOOC ball, yes he does. This course is fantastic to get a hand on what actually is to ""connect over the internet"". Do it!",5
87826,It was amazing course and easy to understand at the same time. Topics cover all the basics . I can humbly offer extra non-mandatory lectures and assignments(A bit harder and taking more effort to complete) for non-beginner students.,5
87827,Perfect!!,5
87828,"Great style of teaching and the material is excellent, a great introduction for users of data (esp external data and through API's)",5
87829,Very interesting.,5
87830,"I learn this class ,the exercise is very easy and do not takes pain to try for it.Just so easy",4
87831,Great course(series) for any beginner willing to put in a decent amount of work; you reap what you sow.,5
87832,Mr Sverance is so funny and humorous. The class is easy to unserstand.,5
87833,Another interesting course.learnt loads.Eagerly awaiting the next.,5
87834,"Compared to other Python Courses I have taken this is course has no meat on them bones and is NOT worth $80 at all even for a certificate. However for FREE? ok. Worth the introduction to some useful tools. Spend your time and money on a more valuable course like Fundamentals of Computing Specialization, which is awesome, and is about the same price as of this writing.This course offers no challenge, little content, and the assignments let me down. Assignments are basically handed to you where you only need to alter one line of text to get the right answer on what is supposed to take an hour.Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python thru Rice U has content and weekly mini projects that really push your learning ability and after taking the courses, I felt like I really got something out of it.This course barely scratches the surface of ""Accessing Web Data"" and does nothing to challenge your coding skills. The positive side, it introduces you to Web API's, the basics of Beautiful Soup, and other BUZZWORDS. At least structure assignments to combine all of the efforts learned in previous chapters onto one another.Side note... what is the professor doing filming lectures on vacation or at lunch? This does nothing to add to the content of the course and is distracting and unprofesh.The meaningless assignments let me down.",2
87835,I liked the course a lot! What I could wish for is additional smaller assignments that test parts of the learnt theory as well as the current assignments. This would make the learning process more intuitive.,5
87836,Great course !,5
87837,a bit short ...,4
87838,This is a very interesting course. I like it.,5
87839,Love it! Just love it!,5
87840,Great Course as usual but the last two assignments kind of looked a bit hard but not really....Thank you to proff Charles,5
87841,"The lecturer explains the course subjects very effectively, accompanied with simple and beneficial exercises.",5
87842,The arguments are really interesting and even quite well explained.In my opinion however it should be focused on less topics in order to gain practical skills: there are too much arguments and none of them seems to be explained in depth.,4
87843,The Course is excellent. It gives a good overall view on many important aspects. The Assignments are too easy while giving the correct building blocks for writing your own programs.,5
87844,"I thought it would just be a primer, but its way more. Loved the course. Looking forward for more courses like these.",5
87845,Very good course and helpful one.,5
87846,"Excelente course, i learn exactly what i want. thank you.",5
87847,Nice course! Simply about complicated.,5
87848,"I'm not exactly new to python, but my typical use-cases looked more like hacking rather then conscious programming.Said all this, I've found the first block - introduction to Python, to be very basic and slow paced, but starting from the Web it is all good stuff only.It deserves to become one of the coursera classics. Great combination of pedagogical talent, humor an knowledge of the subject. It also tremendously helps that the course is backed by the book so it is always possible to look back for that ""Introduction to Python"" part, that I've skipped ;)",5
87849,Excellent course and open source on classroom material is great!,5
87850,The class is awesome! Thank you all!Here is a small piece of advice that it's better to use python3 in the future.,4
87851,"simple but useful, Dr Chuck is a great teacher",4
87852,"I thought this one was better than the first (two) part(s). Short, self-paced, to the point. Easy to follow and implement. Highly recommend this one. (All I wanted is actually the JSON part, but I got so much more.)Quizzes and assignments could be an itch more challenging.",4
87853,"Very practical skills in a painless, easy to follow process.",5
87854,Excellent course! Learning how to get the web data step by step. Easy to start my python career!,5
87855,very good course. I've learned a lot!,5
87856,Fun and informative. Practical examples and programming assignments. Can't wait for next in the series.,5
87857,"This course is well-developed and well-delivered. If one is a complete novice, start at the beginning of this specialty on one's own schedule (on demand at the speed of light) and at an affordable price ($0) and be confident of significant advances in one's knowledge of internet function, in general, and Python, in particular. It is a brave new world. I often feel like Wylie Coyote staring through my toes. Suddenly realizing things have changed. This course fixes that feeling.",4
87858,Great course. I recommend it to anyone,4
87859,clear and crisp explanations of each topic,4
87860,"Another in an excellent series of Python courses. Thanks for making the videos shorter, it's hard to download stuff here in Southeast Asia.",5
87861,Best intro programming series I've taken. Dr. Chuck is the best.,5
87862,"Dr. Chuck is awesome. He explains the course material in a way that is interesting, fun, and informative.",5
87863,Great course which helped me learn a lot about what I wanted to know. Done well with quizzes and assignments and Mr Charles makes class easy to understand.,5
87864,Very interesting Python course. I learned very much. Thank you.,5
87865,Pretty nice and easy course. Very enjoyable.,5
87866,great course and a great instructor,4
87867,Excellent Course Dr. Chuck. Looking forward to the next one :),5
87868,"I was sitting behind a proxy server while taking the whole course, I had to get connected to other network without proxy to perform many assignment... It took me some time to realize that urllib can handle proxy server simple by setting an environmental variable. It would be better if Dr. Chuck can give a gist on how to get past proxy in upcoming sessions.Wrote a crawler and quite often it gets locked up in some kind of error.",5
87869,"Describe in a simple way, I like it!",5
87870,"Great class. Well organized, well taught.",5
87871,"It's a simple, powerful and elegant course that definitely it worths. Thank you Dr. Chuck.",5
87872,excellent course with very clear and well explained topics.,5
87873,"Content is good, with clear explanation.The programming assignment could be improved by adding more challenging questions.",4
87874,explanations are very good!!,5
87875,Loved the course but I wished for more challenging exercises.,5
87876,"This course help easy way to learn python for useful things like REST API consumption, that nowadays are very important.",5
87877,Good pace for a beginner/intermediate level Python programmer. The exercises are meaningful and fairly simple. The course is meant only to get you started.,5
87878,Really fun and quite challenging towards the end!,5
87879,"A good course that gives insight into how data is exchanged over the Internet and how Python can be used to manipulate and use that data. For each chapter, I recommend adding 1 additional programming assignment with a little more complexity.g",4
87880,Amazing Python course! One of the best!!!,5
87881,An easy MOOC as long as you know some Python programming but quite interesting for a global view of some of the available Python libraries and techniques for accessing web data.,5
87882,Course is good but the assignment are too basic. I would appreciate if there could be tougher assignments may be not included in rating.,3
87883,Confusing. No help. Poorly presented.,1
87884,"Extremely useful exercises in pulling data down and getting it ready to process within python. Very nice (and refreshing realistic) that the programming assignments were of the form ""modify this existing code to do something new with this different data source"" rather than ""build something new from scratch"". No academic hangups about the paedogogical value of building something from the ground up. And Dr. Chuck is a wonderfully engaging teacher.",5
87885,useful content and brilliant way of teaching .,5
87886,Great course！,5
87887,"Yet another quite good course from Dr. Chuck; it may be a bit too quick on some of the most interesting parts, but all in all still very informative. And entertaining in its own way :)",4
87888,"So great! I really love this class helps me more closer to Python and it's powerful functions, so many thanks Dr. Chuck!",5
87889,"very interesting course gving an introduction to the use of Python to work with web dataMaybe too quick but in any case, it is a good introduction.",4
87890,Excellent course! Explanation is very clear with plenty of examples.,5
87891,Fantastic course!!! Awesome use of the Coursera platform!!!,5
87892,"I really enjoyed this class for several reasons: 1) Dr. Chuck, 2) The assignments were fun, 3) I did not know python a couple weeks ago, and now I can say that I kinda do! Thanks for a great class! Hope to take another some day!",5
87893,"These courses are great introductions to python functionality. The workload is much more reasonable at 1-2 hours per week than many other Coursera courses that I have taken.My only recommendation is to show more current libraries and methods than those presented in the lectures. Fundamentals are important to understanding concepts, but if there are newer and better ways of doing things, they should be presented as well.",4
87894,Amazing course! All tools that you need to start to access web data,5
87895,"Nice lessons but the assignments were very easy, no challenge.",4
87896,Another great course from Dr. Chuck. The instructor effectively distills the relevant information needed for someone to learn the material without belaboring the underlying theory. These courses are great for people to get their hands dirty as well as more experienced programmers wanting to learn Python.,5
87897,This is an awesome and the 'best' course I've taken in my entire career . Thanks a ton to Dr. Charles Severance and University of Michigan for materializing this course.,4
87898,This course teach me how to explode the Internet in the practical way and not so abstract like other course or book i've learn.,5
87899,Very useful course! I love it! Thank you very much,5
87900,very clear,5
87901,Great course!,5
87902,Teacher is fun and the class is good.,5
87903,"Very interesting. Thank you, Dr. Chuck. I am really enjoy this course.Just a little suggestion. Each assignment can be a little extended. For example, after teaching Google geocoding api, the homework may be assigned to use other kinds of Google API.",5
87904,I applied this knowledge that Doctor Chuck taught me to create a Django web application.This course is a great source of python knowledge I use it in accord with various api's to customize content for viewing of my website /application.,5
87905,As always wonderful. For me assignments could have been harder but I have 2 years experience with programming in Python. Thanks dr Chuck!,5
87906,Almost to the end of the course. Great coursework. I am enjoying every second of your videos. Thank you very much.,5
87907,Great work. Superb Teaching !,5

87910,Thanks a lot for this amazing course !,5
87911,Very interesting and easy to understand.,5
87912,Charles did a great job. Very good lecturing.But the course is not a full course.,4
87913,It is amazing how much you can learn in just a few weeks with this course. Highly recommended.,5
87914,"Really amazing Teacher. Breaks down the concept so well even noobs can understand it.Loved the course :) If you are an intermediate programmer still doing command line input output, you should definitely take this course.",5
87915,More complex than previous two courses in the specialization but rather more interesting.,5
87916,excellent and easy to follow,5
87917,Very informative and well covered.,5
87918,This is a great course! I learned a lot and mastered the key points to using python for Web data access.,5
87919,"a very interesting course ,very good teacher",5
87920,Great lecturer!,5
87921,Very well done. Examples and explanations were clear. Assignments were focused and achieved their intended goals. Highly recommended for those who want to use Python to access web data.,5
87922,"Well structured course, as always. Good work to all of you from the University of Michigan that made this course possible. Best regards.",5
87923,Excellent overview of the how to use the web as your data source for Python scripts rather than files on your computer. Very understandable! Thanks Dr. Chuck you deserve a shrubbery!,5
87924,Dr. Chuck's the man!!!,5
87925,Interesting course covering many useful aspect of modern web programming. I highly recommend it!,5
87926,great class!,4
87927,Great Course,5
87928,"This course is very well organized and the best out of it is that all classes are in the course content. Therefore, you can finish the course faster if you have the time.The lessons are very well explained and the method of teaching is the best.I am really happy with it.",5
87929,Love all the courses done by Dr chuck. Clear and straightforward.,5
87930,Great course. Fun topics.,5
87931,"Awesome.Truly awesome.Professor Severance (a.k.a. 'Dr Chuck') is an amazing teacher, explaining the content in a clear yet engaging way - truth is, it gives the impression of being a wonderful human being tout-court. The coding exercises are very well crafted, and show how to use tiny Python snippets to carry out heavy tasks.So if you've never really sat down to learn regexes, or if you want to have a minimal web crawler/scraper running in less than one hour, this class might be your cup of tea.",5
87932,good course,5
87933,Chuck is the best teacher.,5
87934,Dr Chuck is The Best!!,5
87935,"Amazing course, thank you very much!",5

87939,Very good course,5
87940,Course of Dr. Chuck is one of the best I've even seen for eLearning MOOCs,5
87941,I think this specialization is the perfect entry point for programming newbies like myself...,5
87942,5 Stars! to Mohan Dutta and Introduction to PR.Thank you fro the golden knowledge you have given to me!I wish you taught all the courses in this specializationThank You,5
87943,This course is a good introduction into Public Relations which was a black box to me before. I managed to complete the course in 2 weeks instead of 5. Thanks for the peers to help me peer reviewing my assignments despite late delivery of the first assignment.,5
87944,"Costa tricky course, but I came through very well",5
87945,Very helpful and useless. Veru good for beginners.,5
87946,"Even though it reads Introduction, there is a lot information that will help shape the overall learning.",5
87947,"Many thanks to our professor for taking the time to patiently explain and describe PR's key elements, giving numerous examples and giving a rich overview. As I strongly enjoyed the course I will be continue with followup lessons. However, regarding improvements I would have preferred written assignments instead of Quizzes as they were too 'easy' to pass. Also, PR being a field which requires strong written skills, I would have liked to improve this.",5
87948,Detailed.,5
87949,it was a great course,5
87950,Great course for Public Relations knowledge. Just enough depth of the course for beginners or someone looking for a clear concise understanding of what exactly is Pr and how is it practiced.,5
87951,Repetitive. I already sent this type of course five years ago in college.,4
87952,"This course is beyond abundant in great information. However, there is almost too much information to take in , and absolutely too much information to be able to study in just and hour a day. It needs to be stretched out into 6 weeks instead of 4 to accommodate those with an already busy schedule. For example, one 8 minute video might require an allotment of one hour to properly glean all the provided information. You will need to take notes on almost every word spoken so the pattern will be hit play, pause write out the last couple of sentences (the instructor speaks very quickly), hit play , pause and repeat until the end of the video and then re-watch it in order to absorb everything as one.And beware, in the peer reviews you will need to bullet and highlight EVERY point required extremely specifically in order to get full credit. For example, for the first essay, I wrote it out in ESSAY form as was specified and had all of the required points written out exactly how it was instructed. However, because I did not put into a basic outline form, I received a failed score. I resubmitted the EXACT same content in bullet-ed and highlighted form (which was NOT what was assigned) and miraculously received 100%.",3
87953,Interesting and Substantive. Easy to understand and practical.,5
87954,"I love this course very much, thank you. I wish an Arabic subtitle for they have poor English, and that's my mail if you want any help in ( promoting the course when you translate it into Arabic Language ) - heshammoh80@gmail.com -",5
87955,Very good class. I recommend to everyone who want to study PR.,5
87956,"Good course, good introduction to Public Relations!!!",3
87957,"A good intro to PR , but course material seemed somewhat redundant and lacked challenge at times. Professor's enthusiasm and passion was contagious and greatly appreciated.",3
87958,If you're interested in Public Relations then this is the best stepping stone into the world of PR!,4
87959,Amazing Course!,5
87960,"Realy helpful, thank",5
87961,"This course is pure gold for anyone interested in Public Relations. As a PR practicioner, I've seen a lot of books and materials on PR, and nearly not any of them considered such a broad and at the same time so easy to follow range of topics as this course does.Professor Dutta is a true PR Professional, both in theoretical and practical aspects of Public Relations.Be sure, by the end of the course you will know everything you need to understand PR practice.",5
87962,Very insightful and valuable information for a student and for professionals!,5
87963,Very good course; I enjoyed all the lecture videos and have learned a lot. I look forward to complete other PR related courses from NUS shortly. Thank you.,5
87964,Good introductory course to Public Relations. And the male teacher is really lovely.,4
87965,An excellent course in all respects - I learned a lot about the nature of Public Relations in a very short period of time. This has been a great foundation upon which my future studies in this realm will build. Thank you Professor Dutta and NUS.Regards from Toronto!GA,5
87966,Amazing intro to PR with an inspiring teacher.,5
87967,"As an introductory course I found this simply amazing. The videos, the information, the assignations.I truly believe that this covered the whole PR concept in an introductory way inspiring new PR practicioners. Thank you, professor Duta!",5
87968,I thought it was going to be an all online digital strategy for pr. It's Ok though. the information is very useful.,3
87969,excellent for understanding the fundamentals of PR,5
87970,"Course is well organized, speaker is knowledgable and really enthusiastic.",4
87971,The accents of the instructors make it difficult to understand the material,1
87972,well explained...,5
87973,"Fantastic work, well done!",5
87974,"I am loving this course!! The instructor is great, helpful and knowledgeable. I am already confident that I will learn a great deal about PR from this one course. I plan to enroll in the specialization.",5
87975,it was an amazing journey through the origins of the universe!!,5
87976,"Too long, too diversified, too much usage of technical terms; heterogenous content.",2
87977,"Very good, the only issue for me is to really keep up and study... thanks",5
87978,"very clear structure, interesting materials",5
87979,"A fantastic and wide ranging course, linking geology and evolution, and showing evidence for hypotheses about life and diversity of life on earth.",5
87980,Great course with pleasant lectors. Thanx to University of Copenhagen,5
87981,"excellent, interesting and informative, would recommend",5
87982,This was a great refresher with new information I found invaluable.,5
87983,Some week cources are great others are too confusing or scatchy.,4
87984,I had to work hard in this course but it was worth it.,5
87985,What a detailed course with very good examples and knowledgable presenters. I was highly impressed and learned a lot. Very wide in breath of topics. Highly recommended.,5
87986,A well paced course which helpfully breaks down the different stages highlighting characteristics and progression of both geological and biological periods in Earth's history.,5
87987,"This course is almost outstanding. Half of the presentations are top-notch reviews of the relevant highlights of their subject matter. Half of the rest are logical, but somewhat perfunctory reviews of similar sets of highlights, and finally, the other quarter are sadly hampered by having no visible organization, with delivery that could only have been improved by rehearsing the narrations a couple of times before the lecture was videotaped. I give most praise to presenters Connelly, Pope, Eibye-Jacobsen, Sørensen, Cuny, and Dahl. These lectures alone make the course eminently worthwhile.",4
87988,"I enjoyed this course immensely! I was a bit hesitant due to its length, however, the content was usually manageable and mostly interesting. A couple of the weeks, the lectures are quite lengthy and dense while others were a bit dry. Also, I think the week about bacteria could use a little more explanation. I feel as though I didn't really understand those concepts until watching that week's as well as the next week's lectures. Finally, the quiz questions for the third to last week were a bit confusing and didn't match well to what the instructors actually said.",4
87989,"I enjoyed the course. It was a steep learning curve. Only one suggestion. The reading material is all mentioned in week 1, it would be easier to work with if it was mentioned per week.",5
87990,"This class' information was very mistaken when it failed to mention that you would need background in the subjects being covered to take this course. The teachers, while it is clear that they are very knowledgeable in their fields, fill their lectures with unnecessary jargon. I'm not sure if they are primarily researchers who aren't used to teaching or if they are only used to teaching students who are far advanced enough that the vocabulary of those fields are second nature to them. As someone who was taking this class without that advantage, I was quickly lost among all the jargon, to the point where I just had to stop. I'm hoping the find something else that is truly an overview meant for someone without a science background.",2
87991,Did not want to take this course for credit. Basically watched all of the videos.Found it very interesting and informative.,4
87992,"Thank you so much for this course, I really enjoyed it!I only gave 4 stars because sometimes it is really hard to understand, especially key words (I am not talking about the accent but the group and family latin names, etc); I constantly had to check the subtitles for these.To be honest I wasn't expecting this content after reading the course title, but it was nice to see evolution from this point of view, great job!",4
87993,"Really informative course, the reason why I rated 4/5 is because the lecturers read much too often from the teleprompter. Obviously they all know the material very well but reading it off a screen doesn't feel very natural.",4
87994,Very beneficial for me to take the course. Impressed by the professors and what I have learned about my beginning on earth.,5
87995,Exceptionally good and challenging. Occasionally over my head but pushing me to make the effort to understand.,5
87996,"Great course, a clear and complete introduction to the different aspects of life evolution on earth.A great base to start from. Thank you,Roberto",4
87997,The best evolution course I have taken so far!,5
87998,i find it an excellent course for understanding evolution of organisms and ur planet and universe a whole,5
87999,Very good and complete description of how life evolved on earth and the conditions associated with specialization and dispersion.,5
88000,"Excellent. Very comprehensive course that has relevance to academic research scientists and those with less scientific training. This is accessible for those with busy schedules and encourages and provides information for further reading on the topics. A very good historical overview but critically with up-to-date recent research developments. The graphics, visualizations, animations and on-site demonstrations work very well. I highly recommend.",5
88001,"Nice course, nicely presented. Lots of information about origins and ties together nice.",5
88002,a great Copenhagen University course that takes you on a journey in time and space .,5
88003,"This was an interesting and enjoyable course. The content was wide and varied. On the whole the lectures were well supported by videos and associated charts and tables..However, I found that one or two of the lecturers', though they tried gamely, were a little unfamiliar with English. I fully understand that almost all of these people do not have English as a first (or second) language and admire their competence. If the transcripts had been corrected so that they more accurately reflected what the speaker was trying to say rather than what was actually said, I feel that would be a help. In spite of this, I would recommend this course to my friends and family.",4
88004,"A lot of information, a comprehensive view of earth's history. A minucious 'making-off' of present environment and biodiversity of our planet. Very informative and entertaining.",5
88005,Lots of different instructors made this more interesting,5
88006,"Excellent course on this topic. I have really enjoyed the process of learning and the knowledge I gathered during the process. More importantly, it has broadened my thinking.",4
88007,Full of information and very interesting.,5
88008,"I thoroughly enjoyed the course learning a lot in a sort of retired auditor role. 4.8 instead of 5 stars only because in covering such a broad topic it often felt like a catalog of successive eras and life forms without delving into the mechanisms of evolution. e.g., insects and flowering plants are wildly successful and diverse, but I wanted to explore what it is about their morphology, reproduction and codependent relationship that made this so. Next course!Thank you all for a fascinating look into soooo many things !! :)Stephen",5
88009,"I did this course last year, and consider it to be among the very best I have seen. It is great to have such a diverse group of lecturers, everyone of whom know that material very well; they are great presenters also.If I had been asked, before I took the course, about summarizing 4 billion years in 10 weeks (400 million years per week), I'd have said it was impossible. These guys actually did it, and they did it well!I like the overlap between lectures, as each lecturer had their own style, and sometimes a topic was covered from two different perspectives, which reinforced my knowledge.I'm only sorry that I can't give this course more than 5 stars!",5
88010,"I like it. Clear voices, very comprehensive, al lot of information about our solar system!",5
88011,informative,4
88012,"Assessment for the last half of the course was on stupid dates and small, boring, unimportant details.",4
88013,"Great work, very broad range of themes with interconnections, nice videos, some of lecturers very enthusiastic and therefore they gain the attention of students easily.",5
88014,Great course. I enjoyed the large perspective. Well taught. Would have liked a little more about the Homo evolution.,5
88015,I love this course. Thank you University of Copenhagen and the great teachers :),5
88016,I really like this course. Recommended!,5
88017,Great videos and a,5
88018,"On the interface between Geology and Biology, this great course also offers a brief glimpse of nuclear Physics and the formation of the Earth. Moreover, anyone interested in teaching science for adults will appreciate an interesting array of styles and approaches.",5
88019,Amazing course - very deep and at the same time very general picture of our big history. Thank you very much for this great course,5
88020,A very interesting course with a broad spectrum.Some of the professors might work a little bit on the pronunciation of English!,4
88021,"The course content is very very good and not superficial as some courses we see around here. I liked very much how the order of subjects where build. However, if you allow me to give a *constructive* criticism, please let me say that the strategy chosen to ask lectures to read from previous written scripts, instead of letting them present more naturally, was a bad one. I understand that in order to make the legends/captions available, the lecturers kinda read from scripts their talks and this was very bad. It would be much better next time if you allow each speaker give the talk naturally as they want, with no reading, and then latter produce the subtitles. The lecturers are reseachers and not ACTORS so the final result of reading word by word what they were saying compromised a lot the final quality of their talks. Please don't get me wrong, I just trying to be constructive giving back somehow the time and effort spent by you guys to prepare such nice course.",4
88022,I'm taking this course for the second time. Most of the the topics covered are fascinating and well presented,5
88023,"Sorry, the guy in the first video doesn't blink, which is very weird. The second video was so incredibly dry and boring that I completely lost interest. I know this could be a fascinating course with the proper videos and visuals to help people understand it.",1
88024,stilVery good and contain very recent data that actually can help people who are isted,4
88025,The professors know very well how to explain the subject,4
88026,Very interesting course,5
88027,A lot of info cramped in long videos makes it confusing sometimes,3
88028,"Impressive, one learns a great deal about tasting techniques but also the basics of grape and wine variations. I just wish I had a better for detecting the aromas!",4
88029,Great class. Activities really enhanced the learning.,5
88030,It is a good and interesting course! Thank you for possibilityto become familiar!,5
88031,"Great lectures, great insights and very helpful in my professional life.",5
88032,This course is very interesting! A lot of things that I have learnt can be applied to all day life.The teacher is very nice and clear!,5
88033,I learnt a lot from this course. Excellent!,5
88034,Brilliant course. Would fully recommend,5
88035,"Extremely interesting subject. The exposition is for the most part remarkably clear, though it amounts to a necessarily quick introduction to the vast variety of tecniques and tools. The student is supposed to conduct a lot of practice as self-study and experimenting. Giving 4 stars out of 5 instead of full marks only because I feel this course might work better in an extended format, going more in-depth on real cases and guiding the students through the hurdles and subtleties of such analyses.",4
88036,Great course!,4
88037,"I decided to work on process mining for my PhD thesis and encountered this course. I read Prof. Wil van der Aalst's name from his papers. When I realized he is lecturer, I immediately participated in the course. Finally, I strongly advice the course and the book, Process Mining Data Science in Action, people who would like to learn process mining. I hope, I meet with him and his colleagues studying on process mining.",5
88038,"the course looks into process analysis, which is also a very important section of data science!",5
88039,Amazing Course :),5
88040,"这门课程十分理论知识丰富，又贴近实际应用，很棒。This course is really fantastic, it both has wonderful academical and practical knowledge.",5
88041,Really excellent!,5
88042,Very good overview and provides a good foundation for further exploration in Process Mining.,5
88043,"very comprehensive. well structured. good pace, I would recommend having the book for reference/research.",5
88044,The best course on Process Mining from the best place in Process Mining.,5
88045,"Very informative, though the accent of the lector is disturbing (my apologies)",5
88046,"Excellent course about Process Mining, it's explained all meant to understand process discovery with Data analysis.",5
88047,"Awesome Course, great lectures, the data that is available to use for ProM and Disco really made the difference. I would recommend this course for anyone interested in process analytics or Lean/ Six Sigma business process optimization.",5
88048,Very interesting!!! A good approach to Process Mining!!!,5
88049,"Excellent! Well defined, practical examples and also it shows how it can be used be Prom tool.",5
88050,"Good balance between the more detailed technical stuff and general overview and background. Good quizzes, challenging and relevant to weekly content.",5
88051,Great course and very nice video's lectures!,5
88052,"Great great course.I'm a beginner in this matter so to me there are cases difficult to understand. One thing that could help a lot would be more exemplas of real life for each theorical concept. As done at the beginning with coffee, latte, muffin, ect.Thanks for the energy dedicated to create this course.",5
88053,The best lecture,5
88054,This course is intense and informative. The material is well-presented and the assignments have clearly benefitted a great deal of care from the instructors. Process Mining a fine complement to the more typical data science coursework.,5
88055,"Very beautifully done: information very well and clearly organized, illustrated, presented, and referenced. Friendly approach to a genuinely useful topic.",5
88056,"Great course, brilliant teacher. Explains all basic concepts before digging deep into the course.",5
88057,Excellent Material and presentation standard. Very clear and educational,5
88058,High quality course !,5
88059,A comprehensive introduction to process mining!,5
88060,An exceptional class that covers a very complex topic in a digestible and usable way. It's a good balance between concept and application.,5
88061,"Wow! Changing my life and career, this course does.",5
88062,"most of the contents can be found on the website of raspberry, a quick start for those interested~",3
88063,great and loads to learn,5
88064,There is a large difference between the skills acquired in the video's and the skills needed to fulfill the assignments. There are errors in the video's and without the help of the UCI help forum it is hard to get the assignments right. You can acquire a broad set of skills interfacing with the Raspberry PI but Google is your best friend.,2
88065,Loved it.,5
88066,excellent journey with prof Harris sir,5
88067,good course very useful,5
88068,Got introduction to topics. Good presentation.,5
88069,Great instructor. Clear and concise.,5
88070,One of the worst courses I have taken on Coursera. I have been in IT for 20 years and expected a lot more in this course. There were a couple times that the instructor was inaccurate about a some of the concepts he was teaching.,2
88071,This is a well designed course with excellent lectures and practical work.,5
88072,Interesting,4
88073,"Great course, a lot of fun with the practical assignments",4
88074,I expect the projects and Peer Graded to be a litle difficult.,2
88075,The course content aptly covers the topics,4
88076,Good course with hands on projects. I wish it was a little longer...,4
88077,Ì've really learnt a lot and feel it's useful.,5
88078,Great so far.,5
88079,Nice and informative.,5
88080,Much of the code is outdated (I'm using python 3.5). Fix this and you'll have 4 or 5 stars easy.,2
88081,Needs to be a little more technical and kick up the level of difficulty a notch or two.,4
88082,"its more a linux introducction, not the expected from the title. the content is good but no what was expeceted, as it said interfacing I thought it was more about sensors and gpio programming",2
88083,Good class. not much different than the Arduino one. Useful to learn and use SSH with linux if you do not have a monitor for your Raspberri Pi.,5
88084,"I love teaching style of Dr. Harris, simple but inclusive. He guesses what you are thinking while you are watching the video.",5
88085,EAsy to study and things that we study are helping in projects.,5
88086,Expected more based on the arduino course. Very lite on material,3
88087,"While it is a good class, I have a message that one of my assignments is passed by not verified. I have no instructions on how to ""verify"" it. I'm disappointed something that should be simple is such a roadblock.",3
88088,"As always, great work by Prof. Harris.The typos in the code slide near the end of week four should be cleaned up -- I always try out code as soon as it shows up. I spent a long time with the code on that slide, but got it to work eventually, and the typos were acknowledged in the demo lecture.",5
88089,very interting topic but maybe not deep enough,4
88090,"The course was very nice and useful and the explanations were very good!The biggest problem of this course was that it required to be purchased in order to unlock the quizzes and the assignments. I don't know who decided to do this (the organizers of this course or Coursera) but I don't think it was a good idea.I was not interested (and I am sure I am not the only one) in receiving a certificate. I just wanted to learn and to test the acquired knowledge.I realize that it is impossible to improve this project without any money, but you can obtain the needed money from other sources (donations, sponsorships) without affecting those who want to learn. Event that the access to the video was not restricted (thus, many knowledge can still be acquired by those who want), the assignments have their important role in the learning process.I saw that I am not the only one who mentioned in the feedbacks the purchasing problem for this course. I hope that these feedbacks will be taken into account and the things will be changed for the next editions of this course.To sum up, the information from this course and the manner of providing this, deserves 5 stars. Because of the purchasing issue, I am giving only one star.",1
88091,great course! looking for some advanced course on raspberry pi from same Prof.,5
88092,"This course was supposed to be the last one before capstone and what did we learn:· Nothing about electronic· Huge amount about networking on very basic level – question is what are people without this knowledge at all doing in IoT course· How you can tweet from Raspberry Pi (hey, is somebody crazy here)· Lot of words about camera, few minutes about servo motor and that’s all.We have to write a web server update which is completely unexplained and no one didn’t do it because no one understood it that way (despite the fact that webserver is webserver and server is server) and during whole course no one update the task definitionThere is no discussion board, it was turned off during earlier courses and for me only explanation is that no one from UCI doesn’t care and the certificate for course cost $80-$90.Very pathetic approach which I can only explain with 2 words: “Easy money”",1
88093,"A very good introductory course. The teacher is excellent as are the video lectures.Unfortunately, the new Coursera rules requiring payment before assessments can be accessed meant that I didn't complete any of the assessments. That will probably be a major disincentive for many learners who want to confirm what they have learned.Also, UCI have elected to disable the discussion forums for this course (although I found they could still be accessed via the Coursera App on my Android phone). I can't help wondering if this was as a result of some of the negative feedback posted on the forums in the earlier courses of this specialisation. If so, this really doesn't reflect well on UCI as a teaching institution!",3
88094,"Nice course, nice professor an nice topics.",5
88095,Nice little course . Lack of workload was disheartening.,5
88096,"Ok, really good",4
88097,The course is so simple and just has only a few interesting points.,2
88098,Excellent intro course as always. Looking forward to continue work with UCI.,5
88099,Well explained in other courses finish continuare...,5
88100,"I enjoyed the course, was easy to follow, but I would rather prefer something more challenging",4
88101,this course just for a newbie,2
88102,Is very basic and don't send assignments becose I don't pay the course.,3
88103,"Coursera changed the rules on access to graded quizzes in the middle of this specialization. The last course in the specialization allowed free access to graded quizzes and homework.During this course, the ""free access"" to quizzes and assignments is no longer an option.Even more annoying is the fact that I also receive email reminding me to ""complete the quiz"", which would require me to upgrade to a paid enrollment to allow me to submit assignments to grading.Thanks for nothing, Coursera!",1
88104,only a small portion was applicable to my country and school environment,2
88105,Material is explained well and the comprehension checks along the way are helpful.,4
88106,Great course.,5
88107,Too easy.,3
88108,"Really helpful course, though discussion forums seemed to be available at the end of the course, they wasn´t really available. Presentations sometimes ask you to go to those unavailable forums. Teacher was great (and has the same name as my mom :D) But had some grading issues with 2 questions on quizes",4
88109,great course,5
88110,"I really enjoyed the mathematical point and percentage explanation and the tools to grade assignments enlightening . I always have struggled with the math of grading. I felt that the first and second weeks were very repetitive information; therefore I didn't give it a five star. Otherwise, I thought it was good information. Thanks",4
88111,"I found our instructor to be effective, and this course to be well taught and administered. The instructional material was an excellent preparation for the assessment, which made it a guide and model in addition to being a good course.If six stars were statistically permissible, I would have given six stars.",5
88112,"No option of completing the course without paying. So why do you call your site FREE online courses? And why do we have to go into the trouble of attending the class and watching the videos, and reading the material without being capable of at least watching our results in assignments?",1
88113,Easy and complete,4
88114,Perfect Course!,5
88115,Exceptionally Insightful,5
88116,"not actually much useful course, but still provide some interesting information",3
88117,"the instructor was so fluency in English it was a great to have this course with u , thank alot dr.Joung moon",5

88120,"Very good course , lectures are very helpful. From 1st GEN to 4th GEN and from Bluetooth to LTE-A everything explained in details and in a systematic way.",5
88121,Great course.,5
88122,Helped me a lot in gathering information for my project.Please also include more videos to help in understanding topics better.,4
88123,Its really helpful for me as I am already working in wireless communications. It helped a lot in understanding various concepts specially LTE and LTE-A. Thanks,5
88124,Good course for IT/Electronics/Telecom/CS student and professional .,5
88125,THIS IS COURSE IS HELPFUL TO UNDERSTAND WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY WITH BASICS. IT WILL HELP EVERYONE TO KNOW SAME WHILE STUDYING SAME IN DEPTH.,5
88126,Not the best one on coursera. Included many details that are not really relevant and quizes just checked if you memorized it.,3
88127,"I'm so suprised on proferssor Jong-Moon Chung's English. It's very clear. The lecture gave overall introduction of BT, WiFi and cellular wireless technologies. The content is so big, so if professor may speak in even more details it would be much better.",5
88128,"A lot of powerpoint, nothing else.",1
88129,"_ very informative , well structured and professionally presented .",5
88130,Nice brief introduction to main wireless tehnologies in PAN and LAN segment. Helpful for beginners and ones how want to make up their mind in it.Also provides great presentation by Jong-Moon Chung.,5

88140,I enjoyed this course segment a lot.,5
88141,"Had fun with this course. Precise, concise & the content is cutting edge & juicy!",5
88142,New technologies are not explained in detail in a layperson's term.,3
88143,"Course covers very brief outline of concepts in 3g/4g, wifi, bluetooth. Something kind of introductory course to newbies. But this course is not much useful as it lacks depth in each topic. Need some more advanced course.",4
88144,Putting some numbers on the slide without any explanation of how it works. Only saying what it does.Reading almost only his slide without further information.No basic formulas such as eg. Shannon theorem...,1
88145,try this,5
88146,so easy,1
88147,Very good study material,5
88148,This is an awesome course. And i find it interesting in my line of work. Thanks to team COURSERA.,5

88150,"Very Informative and to the pointAS a wireless designer, I learned couple of very important points that will help better Wireless Designing.",5
88151,There was basically nothing in it. He only repeated the points in the presentation! No explaining just throwing around numbers.,1
88152,Excellent Lectures on emerging technologies like 4G and 5G.,4
88153,I really like this course and got a lot of information about Wireless Technologies.Many thanks for both ( Coursera.org & Yonsei Instructor)Best regards,4

88155,It's really enjoyable and helpful,5
88156,"This course provides an overview that enables significant understanding of the wireless world built around the person. One suggestion, the number of acronyms could be reduced or be presented in a simplified way.",4
88157,It would be great to achieve free certificate,4
88158,Really Good,4

88179,Wonderful course for the beginners in learning communication technologies and their limitations,4
88180,Good courseMust pursue those who want to learn about various wireless technologies.,5
88181,Lot of emphasis on remembering things rather than understanding how they work.,3
88182,wow! It was a great experience to go through this course.It is a beautifully crafted and well researched and very compact but enough for understanding the wireless communication technologies. I have a suggestion that i believe some additional information must be added in the GSM especially its working topology and limitation too.thanks,5
88183,this program is very intersting and informative to me.,4
88184,Fabulous and interesting course which not only clears our doubts regarding wireless communication technologies but also helps us to improve the fundamentals of the era of communication.,4
88185,"A very high level approach. These courses require a better math background and far more concrete explanation, since the student has a passive role and lecture mode is on.",2
88186,I really love it. It shows the most important things about mobile communications.,5
88187,"If you call reading the PowerPoint presentations a course, then don't miss the chance and enroll here !",1
88188,Description could be little more elaborate.,3
88189,Loved it. I really like the videos as well.Wish there were some mini assignments as well.,4
88190,"Too many theory and reading from lecture slides. It would be way much better if some examples were included. Quizzes could include some more questions, too.",2
88191,this course explain all in easy form.,5
88192,Theory is too much.....,3
88193,So easy to understand.,5
88194,The teaching was awesome. I had already taken course in Mobile Computing during my Under graduate study. I suggest you develop a course with in depth concepts covering more technical details.,4
88195,"Nice, it's important for the who interested into the wireless communication ...this for the beginner..",5
88196,Course was good for any Beginner. May be more technical details would further help,4
88197,i need practical information but this video was full of tables,1
88198,Very Good course for newbiees.......really enjoyed it......,5
88199,Very useful course. Clear explainings.,4
88200,it was great and full of information,5
88201,It was very interesting to take this course.,5
88202,Very effective course . Lecture was very clear and meaningful,5
88203,Thank you for spending so much time to prepare this awesome content.,5
88204,"Good course, but too much data for the modules to fully grasp without a background.",3
88205,very interesting course,5
88206,The teacher can explain more and not just read through the slides.,2
88207,Very informative.,3
88208,Very common RF knowledge and less deeper knowledge than expected. It's an high level introduction but definitely no specialisation.Only the LTE part is much better and in more detail right now.Btw. I don't like presentations with reading only the visible content. We all can read by our self. More spoken details between the lines would be nice.,3
88209,Useful information,5
88210,very nice course.thank you,5
88211,Very interesting,4
88212,"Good narrator, solid intro course in LTE",5
88213,Thanks for your course,5
88214,Simple and easy to understan.,5
88215,too much emphasis on acronyms. Not enough time spent on understanding the concepts,4
88216,Very well explained course ..... Just loved it ... I would recommend it to every person who wants to revise basics of telecom and mobile communications ....,5
88217,I learned a lot about wireless communications history in a very short time. Thank you for the clear presentations and materials.,5
88218,The course is too short and not really detailed but very informative. And too bad you can receive a Statement of Accomplishment.,4
88219,"The course is absolutely fantastic, educating and well designed.Thanks to Yonsei University and Coursera.Love You",5
88220,"Throughout the course ""Wireless Communication Emerging Technologies"" , I have learned about LTE and LTE - Advanced which was my primary curiosity. Slide and presentation is fantastic and quizzes are very specific. I have enjoyed a lot and looking further to complete the whole package. Thanks!",5
88221,"nice MOOC , i like it , it was more and more interesting , keep going",5
88222,It is a good intro of the topics.I think the course is simple and very educational.,4
88223,"Well explained, but i was expecting much more depth approach",5
88224,would have given 5 if the assignments were more challenging :),4
88225,Good Informative..,5
88226,i think its clear and concise. Very informative,5
88227,"it's good and very helpful,and i enjoyed it",4
88228,Very good course where you learn a lot about project management and obtain the 35 hour certification to sit for the PMP exam at a fraction of the costs of other programs. I absolutely loved this course.,5
88229,A Systematic and methodical course to learn about Project Management Principles and Practices. It is not only exhaustive and structured but also practical and useful. Many Thanks to the course facilitator and the team.,5
88230,Several times I uploaded material,3
88231,Great !,5
88232,More work than I anticipated but very good details.,5
88233,Great course. Very good documentation and instruction resources. Lots to learn,5
88234,"I strongly recommend the capstone, as it remains the best way to apply the theory seen in the first three modules. It is also an outsanding opportunity to share / compare your own work with your coursera ""classmates"". I was happily surprised that almost averyone choose a real (own) project instead of the provided examples. Very good.",5
88235,"This is a very good introductory course in project management. Mind you, by itself it is not enough to pass the PMP exam, but it does give you a basic understanding of project management and how you can apply project management to your job.The instructor is friendly and the course material of good quality. For me, the highlights of the specialization were the interviews with the PMP's and the Capstone project. I strongly recommend everyone to take the Capstone project because it is a very good learning experience.",5
88236,It is great to have the opportunity to evaluate and put in to practice what I have learnt in this specialization. Thank you!,5
88237,"High quality, high grade!",5
88238,The Course was awesome. I learnt so much with regards to Project managements. Thank you Margaret Meloni!,5
88239,I liked doing the project for hands on training but did not care for students grading my project.,4
88240,This course has been quite intriguing. i learned a lot that i can apply in my day to day work with colleagues and co workers. i am now confident that i can start up my own business and be able to apply what i have learn in my business and as well as assist others in different projects. the practical course was an eye opener. its one thing to know things and another to apply that knowledge. Now im sure and confident that im credible and can apply as a qualified Project Manager. I enjoyed this course and i am proud that i obtained my certificate. i am honored and proud... Thank you,5
88241,Excellent! The Capstone Project was a good way to reinforce the concepts learned in the previous courses.,5
88242,"Great course overall, very well taught and nice real world examples.",5
88243,Thank you for a well thought out course and fun learning experience. The only thing i could think of to add to the course would be more examples of the documents needed to create.,5
88244,its a great course... quite interesting and applicable,4
88245,Very nice theory and very useful practical case with all advises that help to get the best results! Appreciate everyone from UCI and Margaret for this chance to master Project Management!,5
88246,Grading rubric is too generic: If peers don't leave feedback then the student is left to draw assumptions from loosely-defined parameters.,3
88247,A great experience and gives a good idea how the projects are managed in a systematic way. I highly recommend this course to all.,5
88248,An excellent opportunity to put what we'd learned into practice. There's nothing like actually performing a new process for checking your understanding.,5
88249,"There were challenges not having a project management software like Microsoft Project available to be able to set up the predecessors and schedule. After reviewing many peer projects I may have been too detailed in tasks thereby making my project more complicated. I did get all the elements covered. Some of my entries were focused sections that met the grading criteria.Yes I have completed the ""Specialization"". I am in sticker shocked at the $749 for each subsequent courses in order to get a PMP certificate.",4
88250,"Its so amazing way to get back to the education, So Thankful to the authority those have organized such type of enlighted way.",5
88251,"Excellent course, especially for a first dive into project management. Thanks.",5
88252,Great course,5
88253,"A fantastic course, whether or not previous knowledge was there the course really pushes the student to understand the concepts in their own manner.Perfect addition to my skillet, Thank you.",5
88254,This is a gigantic waste of time,1
88255,"The course is very rich, it gives the practical experience in Project",5
88256,Fantastic course,5
88257,Great assignment. Its relevant and helpful to my learning.Project helped me apply the skills and knowledge gained from the Project Management course.Excellent support from the instructors and help from peers and their valuable feedbacks teaches you to work as a team which is much needed in Project's success.Overall very well executed.,5
88258,"An excellent course which teaches one Project Management essentials. Well presented by Margaret Meloni, PMP.Thank you!",5
88259,Excellent way to consolidate and apply the concepts,5
88260,Capstone project methodology is a bit disappointing.The previous modules were great,3
88261,The capstone course brought all the theories and facts I have learned together in one piece.,5
88262,It is a very good project. I understood basic Project Management of PMI well after doing this project.,5
88263,"It would probably make more sense if it was titled ""Project Management Capstone Project"" or ""Project Management Capstone"" or similar. Other than that, no complaints, a single peer assessed project to put into practice what you have learned in the other modules of the specialisation.",3
88264,This is the best training to see if your project program is clear and possesses all the information required for its success,5
88265,Great opportunity to apply the knowledge that was gained during the three previous courses in the project management specialization. Enjoyed the experience very much!!! Thank you.,5
88266,"This last part of the course brings in the practical aspects neglected by the first three sections. Clear instructions, and an assignment that really makes you think through the phases of project management.",5
88267,IT was great to have a chance to put what the previous courses taught to practice. It made sure you actually knew what the material was talking about rather than just regurgitating the slides.,5
88268,It was a true test of the knowledge acquired in the previous courses of the specialization.,5
88269,"Wonderful experience. At first, I dreaded the idea of actually having to create a project. Mostly, my concern stemmed from the idea that I'd be too far ahead of my peers and it'd take too long to get feedback. I'm happy to see that others were working ahead as well.",5
88270,I'm not able to submit my assignments,1
88271,It was an amazing experience. T,4
88272,Well structured and thought of final course. Interacting with peers and reviewing their work was a great experience.,5
88273,Great Course ! Very Practical application in real life projects.Thank you,5
88274,"It is a very course. I learned a lot of project management knowledge, also I applied it in a practice project, which helped me learn and remember all the knowledge.",5
88275,Application is needed to ensure learning.,5
88276,Gave an applied perspective. Thanks.,5
88277,The capstone provides a great opportunity to put into practice the content covered in the previous 3 courses.,5
88278,"Thanks for practical tasks and cross-checking practice. It was fun to review other's work and have critics from your peers.Regards, Vladimir",5
88279,Great course! I learned a lot and I could not find anything that I would like to remove from any of the courses.,5
88280,I HAD AN EASY TIME WITH THE ACCESS AND COURSE MATERIALS,5
88281,I found this course to be very helpful in giving me a hands-on experience in building a project from scratch.,5
88282,"This was a good introduction to the principles and concepts of project management. I completed this course as part of professional development for my current job, and learned some good terminology and best practices. If you have experience with project management or want to learn more advanced concepts, I imagine this course would not be for you. If you're looking for a good introduction to project management that you can build on later, this is a good place to start.",4
88283,Capstone provided an opportunity to make use of various concepts learnt during the specialization. The level of course coverage and difficulty level was moderate,4
88284,I like all of the content and this course provide me to understand the management of a project. This was my first e-learning action and i loved this.,5
88285,Great course to apply what we learned in a practical way.,5
88286,Worth it!!,5
88287,Great course for applying skills and knowledge acquired from prerequisites into a project!,5
88288,"Thank you, for the knowledge you gave to me through these beautiful Courses.",4
88289,"I did all four courses - the whole specialization. Each course in itself was aright and I learned new things. However, the course certificate is meaningless. It neither states the content nor the effort (for example the hours). Instead, it even says ""non-credit course"". This is despite the fact that the course equates ""35 PDU's"" and ""counts towards the UCI Project Management Certificate Programm""; as it was described in the FAQ. I feel betrayed. How can I apply with such a meaningless peace of paper anywhere?",1
88290,It is a great way to solidify all the knowledge acquired in the other courses. Everyone should do this!,5
88291,Thank you for the great lectures and illustration.,5
88292,"An extremely thorough treatment of the initial stages of the Project Management process, which in many cases is the most important! Thoroughly enjoyed it.Would recommend it to everyone!",5
88293,A great way to put in pra,5
88294,This series of courses exceeded my expectations. The capstone exam was challenging. Recommend.,5
88295,"The capstone provides a good opportunity to apply the material from previous courses. Very well organized, and grading is fairly prompt. Thanks.",5
88296,Thanks to this part I was able to test my knowledge and create something useful which I can use at work or in my private life.,5
88297,This is a unique experience of learning. You learn the concepts and practice them by project and reviewing others project. This is really good.,5
88298,A perfect way to close this course. You get to apply what you have learnt and gives you more clarity about each major component.,5
88299,Capstone really helped me apply all the learning from the course and helped me understand how to practically work on each element of project management.,5
88300,"the peer review was a waste of time, some individuals submit whatever other review whatever; I found that the assessment criteria is not based on evaluating the quality of performed work, and therefore have not really learned much from the capstone project. I am taking another course which as well has peer review, I am rethinking if it's worth it.... do not see any value, there is no real feedback from instructor. If I need it a peer review, I could just ask my colleagues at work.",1
88301,"I enjoyed this course very much. Thank you for offering this course for folks like me who need an introduction to Project Management. Although it was extremely helpful to put my learning into practice and do the work, I found the peer reviews difficult to assess. When reviewing the work of my peers, some of the information did not flow as a project as a whole. For instance, sometimes the WBS did not match with the project activities sequence, but because the rubric/peer review was so broad, as long as the peer put down 10 or more activities, he/she received a perfect score. I do not believe this is an accurate reflection of ones full understanding of project management with the given rubric. I suggest creating a more detailed rubric that helps bring all the information together where those doing the peer review and those creating the documents can see the value of each part of the assignment. The assignment should essentially match the rubric to ensure accuracy of grading.Thank you again for this opportunity to take your course!",3
88302,"An excellent finale for the program, giving us the oportunity to apply most of the knowledge received through the different courses. The capstone project is clear, easy to understand in terms of structure and requirements. It lacks some of the contents of the course but most of the content is included. Once again thanks to Ms Meloni, all the team from UCI and Coursera, keep the good work!",5
88303,I think the capstone is a really good technique to put everything I've learned from this specialization into real-life use. I understand it even better now. Thank you,5
88304,A lot of fun!,5
88305,The most useful course of the specialisation!,5
88306,i havent been able to finish the specialization but its the best course,5
88307,I think tha the evaluation wasnt correct but despite that everythin,4
88308,Though but its well worth the time.,4
88309,Nice course to be taken!,5
88310,It was a very useful course! thanks a lot,5
88311,Awesome! Worth it!,5
88312,Excellent summation of preceding courses. Peer review was particularly helpful in comparitively evaluating your own project and how one can improve their use of these tools. Very good course.,5
88313,Great way to practice your project management skills before applying to PMI.,5
88314,Excellent. this course has exceeded my expectations,5
88315,"An excellent way to bring all the course concepts together by requiring the student to generate the actual products themselves, as opposed to just learning information for testing.",5
88316,Great course to tie everything you learn from the previous courses together.,5
88317,This instructor is one of the best! I have learned more in her online courses than any in-class instruction. Thanks much.,5
88318,Great Course,5
88319,Awesome course.,5
88320,"It was a good exercise, but there were some inconsistencies between the assignment rubric that was published and the grading key the students use to evaluate your work. More alignment between these two would be helpful.",4
88321,Great Final Project. It's just the right amount of work to put into good used everything learned on the previous courses. It really ties everything down,5
88322,A practical approach on the topics we've been studying in all previous courses and an effective way to apply that knowledge.,4
88323,Really miss Margret spend a lot of effort and give us her experience on plate of goldi really enjoyed this course and learn very useful and usable information,5
88324,Great Course.,5
88325,You really learn my exercising your knowledge in a real project that you want to follow.,5
88326,"This capstone project helped me to design a pilot project plan for one of my dream projects. From this experience, I would be able to develop further, my knowledge in project charter planning and designing",4
88327,The course was a great stepping stone on my way to PMP. Thank you!,5
88328,I really enjoyed this course,5
88329,Helps to learn using the theoretical knowledge for practical work.,5
88330,best study place,5
88331,Great Course!,5
88332,"This course is very instructive and well-paced like the others in the specialization. However the Raspberry PI ecosystem has evolved since the course materials were created. Although it's still possible to follow the videos, I think it would make it easier to update some things a little bit.",3
88333,"It was very good, all the basics about python and the raspberry pi platform. I would like if you publish a book to read about the topics, for example I have been reading the book ""Think Python"".",5
88334,"I am new to Linux, this course teaches handful of commands to use RaspberryPi and great details about python.",4
88335,I enjoyed this course. It is well structured and a very good introduction. I only audited the course.,4
88336,Need a discussion forum.,4
88337,Really helpful for a good start with Raspberry Pi... Thanks a lot,5
88338,"Content is interesting, even the Twitter section (which looks unrelated to the main goal of the course). Some classes were recorded using Python 2 while the course targets Python 3.",4
88339,Nice explanation...cleared all my doubts in a meaning full way,5
88340,Lots of fun and gets a bit into web connectivity. I enjoyed this series!,5
88341,It is a great starters course for newbies to understand and get their hands dirty on a pi.,5
88342,"Great Course! Straight to the point, just what I expected. I came with ton of disappointment from IBM's course, development guide to the IoT. I was very frustrated when I started taking the course. half way through, though, I was all energetic and learned a lot. Best feature, teaching is straight to the point. I am talking the whole specialization!",5
88343,"Well course teaches basics of python but you should always refer to python documentation in order to understand the concepts correctly. To the course staff, please update the slides where Python2 is used to python3.",3
88344,"Incredible course, incredible teacher. Very useful and enjoyabel.",5
88345,Great introduction to the world of Raspberry Pi and how to star your IOT projects.,5
88346,It is a good starting point for IoT learning,5
88347,Really gets you into the basics of Raspi and Python programming associated with working on Raspi.,5
88348,Great course! Great hands-on learning.,5
88349,Thanks !Course is perfect as usual :Step by Step & accurate ...Complicated things becomes so simple when correctly explained !!!,5

88361,Great!,5
88362,"great intro course, engaging instruction",5
88363,"I am a newbie with R.Pi so this course help me a lot in the studying process with R.Pi. I gain many new interesting knowledge.I wish the learner could take the quizzes and know the results without upgrade, that would be better. I agree once the learner need to print the results and some official certificate, so need to upgrade.",4
88364,"Very short overview, well explained but wish there was more depth.",3
88365,Good content as long as you have some familiarity with programing and computer configuration.,4
88366,Thorough and indepth course.,5
88367,A quick jumpstart to your journey on Raspberry pi. Recommended.,5
88368,"Thank you professor, very nice videos !",5
88369,"Good course, but I expected something a little more detailed and to last a little longer. The videos were good, but w little long for the amount of content that they contained. For instance, a few videos could be compressed to the size of one video and still contain the relevant content.",4
88370,thanks for providing me knowledge about such cool stuff.,5
88371,Learned basics of Raspberry Pi and Python easily,5
88372,"Nice course, but could be better supported.Video: On Programs on whiteboard several wrong syntax (UC/LC writing)Better: Not just there's the doc on web - study it - rather point on important things on doc and make tests.End of week 4: Second link to program is missing, when making peer review, everyone can learn so much from each other.Pi Hardware: I missed awfully electric characteristics on GPIO. Looking on the web, anyone was talking about this matter (max. 50mA total all outputs, max. 3-16mA ?? each...). A little electronics guide how to dimension LED resistors and pullups / pullsdowns and how to drive relais would be nice. Many student know surely less about electronics, but to interact with IoT it is nessecary.Coursera: Not on all platforms (iPad i.e.) you can make positive comments when reviewing.",4
88373,"It is indeed a good course, especially because of learning about UNIX and the GPIO pins. I missed reading material, since the videos are too short for learning something in a deep way.",3
88374,I've learnt from this course. It's very useful for me.,5
88375,Very well structured course.,5
88376,I liked the course very much.,5
88377,Good for total beginners. If you have even some level of experience with programming/fiddling with computers this is too slow paced.,4
88378,"good introduction to raspeberry but very few about python programming, expected more",3
88379,Thanks for Awesome course. :),5
88380,"Professor Harris does a good job overall, but he does not explain Python syntax in depth. I audited the course and found it quite simple. However, I recommend a paid subscription to get the most out of it.",3
88381,"Great content, and I really like Prof. Harris' way of explaining things.",4
88382,Pretty brief and informative.,4
88383,I like it very much!,5
88384,a nice course to learn the basics of python and raspberry pi programming!!,4
88385,"Good lecture and content. However, disappointing that even when I audit the course, I cannot take the exams. This is contrary to most of the other Coursera courses where you can. If you cannot afford to participate you have limited access to the testing material. I'm not impressed.",2
88386,Excellent! Great teacher!,5
88387,Could be made better by teaching linux basic syntax for LXTerminal,4
88388,perfect beginner course for the raspberry pi,5
88389,a nice introduction course for beginners。,4
88390,"The course has the best introduction to raspberry pi , very useful .",4
88391,"Nice course. Gives a good thousand-foot view of the Pi, Python programming, and how you can use Python to manipulate the GPIO pins on the Pi.",4
88392,Very basic collection of concepts. Not too much practical exercices,2
88393,The course provides the right platform to folks who are newbie to python and gives meaningful information for development on Raspberry Pi,3
88394,Easy to follow and informative,5
88395,Good course. Nice pace and good explanations.,5
88396,Great Course !,5
88397,I think this course was the most complex of the courses to this point. Prof. Harris shines in his ability to clarify the complexities. It really is a gift. At this point I can begin to see how all of what we are learning comes together.,5
88398,A little light on content. Expected more interaction with features of the board.,3
88399,It's a great jumpstart introduction to get your teeth on python and raspberry pi. Professor Harris makes it a enjoyable trip to a new world of possibilities for enthusiast creators and developers.,5
88400,Some of the stuff is a bit overall but the instructor still manages to cover a lot of a material and he manages to explain it in a good manner. And then you just gotta love engineering. No other field would get away with talking about a bus full of slaves.,5
88401,"Great course . Thanks Professor , Ian.",5
88402,Nice course. But as usual lacks workload.,5
88403,"Great course, simple illustrative videos of lectures and some good excercises/assignments.",5
88404,Great course. I just had to google a bit for the last assignment but overall meets expectations. I now know what I did not about this little device !,5
88405,Awesome Course for beginner to Understand Raspberry pi,5
88406,Very good course.,4
88407,Very good course for those beginning to get their hands dirty on raspberry pi,5
88408,"very good intro to Raspberry Pi. I wish there were more actual projects using the hardware components of the device, but overall, it was a good course",5
88409,It is very good explained but it is just an small introduction about how to use the Raspberry Pi in a IoT framework.,3
88410,Content was far too basic in my opinion.,3
88411,Good introduction to Raspberry Pi platform,5
88412,Very bad introduction to Python and almost nothing about Raspberry Pi itself.,1
88413,really enjoying this course so far like the format it keeps me interested not too tough just right and I am learning the whole way through,5
88414,"Mr. Harris is great! A lot of course content could be as a prerequisite. For example, basic control structures of the python could been left out, just having a reference to material describing them. I hope following course will focus more on Raspberry Pi specifics.",3
88415,"Excellent course, very relevant and updated.",5
88416,"I think, this course is great for fundamental knowledge.",5
88417,"Good course, just publish what hardware is needed ahead of time not at the beginning of the first week!",5
88418,Great teacher!,5
88419,"A nice, if a little basic, introduction to the Raspberry Pi Single Board Computer and to controlling the Raspberry Pi using Python.",4
88420,Excellent introduction to RPi!,5
88421,More matter should be covered in this course.,3
88422,"Love this instructor. His approach is extremely lucid and easy to follow. I am also taking the Python classes offered here by U of Michigan, and the instructor of those courses doesn't have the same natural facility for communicating.",5
88423,It is too simple and baic,3
88424,"I liked this course. There were no alternatives of the course covering such subject before and I am glad of appearance of this course. I rated it 4 stars, because there still is space for course improvement, but I recommend very strongly to attend it if you are interested in subject.",4
88425,Clear and well explained. Thanks Mr. Harris.,5
88426,"This course would have received five stars but there was no discussion forum and the weekly assignments lacked clear explanation. I feel that instructor could have gone a little deeper into the subject matter.However, I liked the laid back instruction style. The assignments were perfect for beginners like me. I'm looking forward to the follow-up course.",3
88427,"Good course, professor Ian is very good. Only I miss a more deep discussion and maybe more complex assignments. Thanks a lot!",4
88428,The course is a little bit basic for me but it is interesting and didactic.Thank you to Professor Ian Harris.,5
88429,"Since it's the penultimate course of the certification, I expected to contain more practice projects. It's the only downside from my opinion. Course material is excellent, and instructor knows what he is talking about.",4
88430,It's a very interesting course!,5
88431,"its a good course, a brief introduction to raspberry pi.",5
88432,"Very well done (3 stars so I know I have completed the lectures but not the work, will change after completing assignments)",3
88433,Good class for beginners with Raspberry Pi,5
88434,easy for newcomer! Great!,4
88435,Excellent course! I think that it could touch more difficult topics and homework could involve some deeper practice regarding programming and hardware.,4
88436,"Excellent course, it gives nice introduction on Raspberry Pi, unix and Python. However student background in unix and/or python will be a plus in this course.",5
88437,Another great course.,5
88438,It's cool.,5
88439,Easy to follow amd understand. Highly recommended to start with the raspberry pi,5
88440,"Although I missed the input of TAs, mentors and the Professor and didn't find the generalised thread as useful as the classic Coursera forums I still found the course to be interesting. As with the Arduino course I found the Demos to be the best part. I'm hoping I'll learn a lot in the second RPi interfacing course. I think it would be especially good if the RPi and the Arduino were connected in the next or some later course. I think also that some interaction between the Professor and the material on the presentation would enhance the lessons. What I enjoyed most was actually writing the programs and getting the circuits to work.",4
88441,"Really nice and easy introduction to Raspberry Pi and Python. I loved the part when the professor said something about Scratch, like 'we'll not use it, we're way above it'. :)",5
88442,"So far good. I really like the ""smaller detail without too much detail"" approach. The RaspberryPi is easy to master given excellent support by the Pi Foundation but then there is little too much to access. This course kind of streamlines what one needs to know. I have been using the Pi since 2 months but already feeling more confident thanks to this course and I have just finished only Module 1.",4
88443,Good for anybody that want to start learning Raspberry Pi. Lectures are concise and get you experimenting quick.,4
88444,"I love this course, Professor is very good, he goes slowly explains very good,",5
88445,"Nice explaining.Those things i thought i knew, even they were clarified further.",5
88446,Very good video simulations there are. They are very helpful to understand how to approach victims.,5
88447,"I found the course good overall, but the tempo was a bit slow for me and I thought that the online lectures could have been provided in a shorter period of time. Ideal for a beginner, but I had some previous experience with PFA.",3
88448,"Thank you very much, very informative, course presented in an excellent fashion",5
88449,realy helpful for my job as a disaster volunteer,5
88450,great couse!,5
88451,"Great course, offering knowledge that can be indeed applied on daily life as well as work-related settings. Highly recommended.",5
88452,"Very helpful and informative, Thanks",5
88453,"I liked all the content though I thought presentation of it was a bit boring, a lot of the what not to do examples were a bit obvious or extreme rather than attempting to shed light on the subtle mistakes one might be inclined to do. Some of the quiz questions seemed almost purposefully confusing or worded in a trick way, which felt a little pointless. Otherwise I've enjoyed everything I've learned and would definitely take another PFA course, maybe a level 2 or something.",4
88454,I learned so much in this course. It will help me as an educator.,5
88455,The course has helped me immensely in designing a responsive psychological application... thanks Coursera.,5
88456,This was my first organized class post B.A. and I found it to be a great class that was well organized with a knowledgeable instructor and would recommend it to others. I have dyslexia and ADD PI so these characteristics are important to me and I would be eager to take more classes from George. Thank you.,5
88457,Thank you for giving me excellent information on psychological system.It is very helpful course for me. Thank you Johns Hopkins University and Coursera.,5
88458,Great class.Very imformative.,5
88459,"Great course, learn a lot about how to listen and correctly ask questions. Using RAPID model is a good way to help people in need during a disaster. :) Thank you!",4
88460,Awesome course!,5
88461,It helped me a lot to know how I should intervene correctly in extraordinary cases.I am very satisfied.,5
88462,"I am very satisfied of the course. A little problem was the language, but I tried to repaid some times the lectures. I will use the knowledge in future needs.",5
88463,"Dear Mr. Everly,The course is very well organized and objective. Maybe it could be offered in more languages – at least with subtitles – so more people would benefit from it.Although I had not had any previous experience with PFA, I am pretty sure that I had been trying to find this field of knowledge for a long time… I am a psychologist (with a Psychosociological orientation) from Brazil and I have been working with human rights and community development in different settings and projects for the last 15 years also in other countries for short periods.During the first simulation video, I was really touched, especially because I realized that I had found something that made complete sense to me as a psychologist, especially when our mentor stressed “it’s not therapy”. I am not a clinical psychologist and I did not come across these techniques and studies while I was at the university, and when I pictured myself working with refugees or the people at my city – I realized that we can apply PFA not only to people at catastrophes, but also to people living in very violent areas in some parts of Rio de Janeiro or São Paulo.Before the course, I was not satisfied with my resources to work in some settings: “Am I going to provide psychological therapy? No, it is not what I do”. But the PFA, yes, that I can picture myself doing it and have been doing something similar all my life. So, all I can say is Thank you, I will dive in.Best regards,Gabriela",5
88464,This course should be attended by everyone,5
88465,Excellent course. I have taken other PFA courses and this is by,5
88466,Your ideal course for the first line of actionin a crisis,5
88467,"Well-thought, qualitatively designed and, in the mean time, brief course. Very simple structure (definitely a good thing!) and simulation videos make Psychological First Aid very interesting subject to learn. All actions are analyzed and explained in detail. Would recommend it not only to psychologists, physicians or other doctors, but also to those who are interested in psychology itself and have no academic background in this area. You may discover some new stuff that will be both curious and useful for you",5
88468,This course is elucidating to beginner students in Psychology.,5
88469,"Thanks, really good course. Loved the case viginate",5
88470,"This course is excellent. I work as a security technician for a mental health hospital and took this to supplement the training I received for my job as well as to be able to offer support to others in disaster situations. While taking this course, I actually used some of the techniques I learned to intervene in crisis situations with patients at the mental health facility I work at and to successfully deescalate those situations.",5
88471,"I found it very insteresting I learned that many of the things that we do to help people are actually called interventions and are valuable skills. I like the order, the vocabulary and the examples. What I don't like is the price of the certificate I will be willing to pay no more than 30 dlls. I am interested in many courses but I can't pay 45 dlls. For each :(",5
88472,Good course - learned a lot and will use it in the future,4
88473,"This is a great and practical course, recommend!",5
88474,Really good course that teaches how to respond after a disaster or crisis without being a trained mental health professional. Instructor is very experienced and knowledgeable. Highly recommend.,5
88475,Thank you for this course I really liked it. It is very helpfull,5
88476,i found that the foundation principles are important and the practical examples fostered the learning process. It fits will into the needed services in a disaster situation.,5
88477,"Although mostly basic information, was a very interesting and practical step-by-step guide to the basic steps of psychological intervention in a crisis situation. I enjoyed Everly's presentation and speaking style, it was easy to understand, practical, and effective.",5
88478,This course is a good way to start anyone on learning more about how to help others in distress. You don't need to be a trained clinician or mental health expert to learn about psychological first aid. I think it would benefit communities tremendously if more people can learn about PFA.,4
88479,It was really helpful and educative. i will be able to use knowledge gained to help people in my community who are in need or require such aid.,5
88480,helpful. especially to get ideas about psycho therapy beside administering drugs(:,5
88481,Very easy to grasp and very useful.,4
88482,Really informational course.,5
88483,"I enjoyed the practical videos, but the lecture slides had too much text on them, I think.",4
88484,"An excellent course at the hands of Ph.D. George S. Everly, Jr. Intended for those who are in the area of education and social care with no or little knowledge about mental education. I recommend it for those who think that it could support them to face humanitarian crises.Thank you!",4
88485,Really helpful!,5
88486,very interesting course !!you learn alot of new things the course and the as someone that dosen't speak English as my mother languish it was very easy to understand and it was explained very good !,5
88487,A very helpful course and full of practical information for persons interfered with disaster relief and crisis intervention as this course has a well- planned syllabus and really informative vignettes,5
88488,Thank you George for explaining each and every step in a simple but profound way. Simulations were really helpful to understand the essence of the first aid and I found myself several times stopping the video and thinking about the possible ways of supporting and listening.,5
88489,"Great course! Sometimes it got a little bit boring and in the next moment the important information was too fast spoken to me (no native speaker) - but i enjoyed, that some complicated sentecnes have always been repeated in more simple language without too many foreign words! I also enjoyed the videos with the false/correct methods which were shown. Dr. Everly has a good voice and pronaunciation, so that i was able to listen. also great, that the quiz has no timelimit, like questions need to be anwered in 3 minutes, because i had to translate a view words into german to understand the questions and this needs time. thanks!",4
88490,"Very good introductory course which will give you a solid basis to continue exploring the subject. The lectures are well structured and paced. It includes ""real life"" examples of how to implement the theory you just learned.",4
88491,"The course was interesting, accessible, and the content was presented in a way that made it practical and useful. I only wish that the class went more in depth and was a bit longer!",5
88492,very goog in combination of speaking and showing (video),5
88493,This course is very helpful. I am satisfied with it.,5
88494,"This course was very informative and helpful, especially for a beginner's course. I wish I would have been exposed to different scenarios of situations people face. For example, dealing with a death, mass shootings, terrorist attacks, more natural disasters like earthquakes or tornados, and even abuse. However, learning the basic terms and how to approach and speak to others was very helpful. Thank you!!!",4
88495,"This Content mainly focused on Disaster Survivor's psychological support.However, I am still looking for like daily basis psychological support.For example, employees' stress, children's stress. etc.",4
88496,Best course to learn psychological first aid,5
88497,it was really good,5
88498,"It helped me learn about PFA and grow as a person. I think everyone should take this course in the interest of mankind, and in the interest of the community. The course material is so so good. Thankyou to Dr Everly and the great team from John Hopkins University Bloomberg school of Public health.",5
88499,very interesting and loved watching all the lectures,5
88500,Very informative and clear.,5
88501,Amazing course and very helpful. Goes along with my suicide prevention and QPR. This will just be one more tool in my toolbox.,5
88502,"I am very thankful for the opportunity to attend this course. Given information in it is too valuable, although I'd wish the course was more extensive. Separetely I want to admit the mastery of a teacher - George Everly, who gave information qualitatively and made interesting video stimulations. I hope to see the next ""chapter"" of the course or something like that.",5
88503,SImple and easy to learn ...hope to help others some day..,5
88504,"A great course for anybody working outside the field of mental health, and interested in psychological first aid. Too basic for psychologist or mental health workers, but wonderfully summarised.",4
88505,"Great exposure to the topic, great presentation!",4
88506,"It's short but packed full of practical knowledge for lay person. The instructor Dr. George was really excellent in the narration, love his modulated voice, and did an excellent role playing. I really enjoyed this course, and loved listening to all the videos. The notes in the videos really help integrate the lectures together. Thank you Dr. George, thank you Coursera. Would take any course presented by Dr. George.",5
88507,a really great and interesting course,5
88508,"There's a lot of theory for a beginner like myself, but it's presented nicely. I found written out lists and terminology very helpful. The RAPID methodology is very clear-cut, I'm sure it will be helpful 'in the field'. The vignettes are really self-explanatory, and help to put a visual to the theory. Overall a very well done course. Thank you!",5
88509,I really enjoyed taking this course. I found that right from the beginning I became a better listener for my friends and family and they took notice. I know this course will be a launching pad to help me help others in the future as well as make it easier for me to identify if I need help myself.,5
88510,"An interesting, informative and nicely presented material.",5
88511,"Excellent course! I have already recommended it to several co-workers and people in my field of work. As a trained birth doula, I have received necessary tools to assist parents and relatives after traumatic birth experience, as well as, have a list of relevant resources available to continue their support and recovery when it is out of the scope of my practice and training. I am also happy to be equip with this training for the needs of the community in emergency situations.Thank you.",5
88512,"It does what is promises to do very well, it's a great introduction to PFA, but I think also useful in other life situations and I would suggest this course to anyone who would like to show more compassion towards people in everyday life and is not sure how to do so. Most importantly, however, it does introduce the state people may be in after a disaster well, and arms you with some knowledge of how to be of assistance in such situations.",5
88513,"Interesting topics, clear explanations, great use of good example/bad example videos. The right way to start a journey into the world of psychological emergencies response",5
88514,Great course!,5
88515,"This course is very insightful in PFA, the lessons and simulation videos are super helpful in giving you an idea of real life experiences!",5
88516,Wonderful course!,5
88517,What an interesting course! Dr. Everly is amazing at delivering the course material and the pace is perfect for the non-emergency related individuals. Thank you so much for taking the time to prepare and offer this course!,5
88518,"Excellent course. The presenter really knows his stuff and presents it with an easy tone and voice. A course like this could be a lot of fluff, but this one has detailed steps and video examples and what to do and what not to do. I plan to use what I learned in the course in different ways than just disaster relief, but everything I learned was very useful.",5
88519,I'ts good,5
88520,"Great course. It provided me with in depth knowledge and skills to really grasp the concepts of empathy, compassion and what it means to have a true desire to help people in crisis situations.",5
88521,"Very detailed and informative. Requires you to really understand the concepts. Not just a ""touch and go"" course.",5
88522,I like the course it is very informative and all those skills are simple and easy and these things can be able to cope up by those who are in need of help!,4
88523,very helpful,4
88524,Very helpful for crisis intervention events.,5
88525,"This course is easy to follow with a mix of resources making it engaging and inspiring. I found the RAPID PFA model to be an effective and proactive response to dealing with adverse situations. It is very interesting to learn that this technique is found to be more effective than that of a series of post disaster psychotherapy, so this can be taught to non medical aid workers and possibly alleviate some of the sometimes unnecessary strain on medical and/or psychological resources. It is all about going back to basics, a need to reach out to others and a need to communicate and not suffer in silence.",5
88526,"Love this course! I am only a Grade 10 student right now. This course is very structured and organised in a way a beginner can understand. It provides stimulations which is very helpful. Good course, definitely recommend!",5
88527,Thanks for such an amazing course,5
88528,"Very good course, Makes you more useful for your self and society.",5
88529,"Great insight in how to listen, talk to and help people who have just experienced the worst day of their life.",5
88530,"Important topic, accessibly taught.",5
88531,Great course.,5
88532,very useful and to the point,5
88533,"I found the course informative, interesting and well presented, with two exceptions:a. There was some use of profession-specific terminology/jargon, which is problematic when addressing a target audience from outside the same profession.b. It is repeatedly stated in the course that no two interventions are done the same, and yet only one intervention simulation is used. I would have liked to see multiple simulations covering a range of possible interactions, to afford a more comprehensive understanding of survivor reactions and appropriate intervention responses.All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed the course and found myself eager, at the end of each lesson, to get stuck into the next.",4
88534,"Very interesting Course. Thank you very much Prof. George.By the way, ""PFA"" was the main topic for the celebration of the ""World Mental Health Day 2016"" led by WHO and WFMH. Refering to the official document from WFMH, PFA is also presented as part of the dignity of mentally ill.Bravo again.Achour",5
88535,"This was a good course filled with great information and various techniques I think are useful in everyday life as well as in disasters. I do feel like the concepts could have been explained better and I would have liked more elaboration on certain things that are in the assessments. I struggled quite a bit in the assessments, especially with questions regarding the simulations with Gina. I felt like I had a good understanding of what was being taught until did my assessments and received a low grade. I personally would prefer if things were slightly more spelled out for us so that there is less to intuit. I also prefer reading the transcripts along with watching the videos as I learn better that way, but I don't feel like the transcripts for this course were written well or had good grammatical structure. I often had to go over things many times, or refer again to the video, to understand certain points. For example, I feel that in transcripts it's unnecessary to always directly quote each and every word being said by the speaker like the following, ""...and, and, you know, this is, this is something very important..."" but rather typing ""...and you know, this is something very important..."" would make as much sense and be easier to read and digest.",4
88536,"As a clinical psychologist, this course helps me put things into more grounded perspective. For example, upon how should I teach others to facilitate distress of the people next to them, and how to take care of themselves before attend to others.",4
88537,"great Info! great techaer! great excercises!, great simulations! do not hesitate in taking this one! very happy with the result",5
88538,"I really enjoyed taking this course. I appreciated that the material was not huge, but specific, articulate and to the point. It really offers to the learner a sound basis on how to offer psychological first aid.",5
88539,"Great introductory course! Very nicely spoken and explained, good structure.",5
88540,"Dr. Everly presented this course in a concise way to explain RAPID model, and as a beginning counselor, I found this course is particularly helpful to refresh some of the basic helping skills. I love the simulation part since it provides me with the direct experience of what kind of statement can be harmful. This course also offers slides as well. While I am writing notes for the course, PPT actually saves my time to jot down the concepts and definitions. After all, I do like Dr. George Everly's slow approach and kind attitude. Thank you very much!",5
88541,So far it's very stimulating and helpful.,5
88542,Love this course! This course has been really helpful...Thank you so much!!,5
88543,"There is always something that you never know when you can use them. However, things really happen all the time. Knowing something is really helpful. That's why I would highly recommand this course to non-psy major students.",5
88544,"It is great to have this course, it helps us to understand why do we need to have strong sense and knowledge about mental health.",5
88545,Exceptional. Very informative and make one understand different kinds of trauma one goes through. Everyone's experience is different,5
88546,Short and to the point!,5
88547,"This is a great course, with quality material and helpful videos. I felt very engaged and interested to learn through the course. I have learned some good techniques to help my clients at work with de-escalations techniques and paraphrasing for example. Thanks!",5
88548,"George made the PFA lecture very interesting. I feel like i am sitting in the class room, It help me to understand more about psychological first aid needs and how to be a good listener.",5
88549,This course is very well written and the videos are engaging. The professor is extremely knowledgeable and gives concrete examples of proper and improper interactions between first responders and in crisis individuals.,5
88550,I enjoyed this course - it has Really great information for how to effectively assess and help people in need. Recommended.,5
88551,"Very helpful information. I could use more pointers on how, precisely, to do the ""Intervention"" phase - more practicals. Thanks!",4
88552,"Very interesting course, it took all of my attention for a while. The concepts are well defined and the classes were enjoyable (even though the slideshow itself was lacking images). The best part is surely the simulations that, besides being funny sometimes, could demonstrate really well the real life situations that one might participate. Overall, i feel like i can help someone in this situation way better than before.",5
88553,Great very useful course. Many thanks for this opportunity!,5
88554,"Excellent,its soo good to be able to do this course on-line. As a professional, I feel this course has enlightened me to better serve our communities in the event of a disaster or any kind of trauma. I never want to be unprepared in case someone is in trouble. TAKE THE COURSE. IT IS EXCELLENT.",5
88555,Great introduction to PFA with a useful model for implementation. The inclusion of a history and research for its use rounds out the information. I would only ask for the next level course to be offered!,5
88556,"Really useful course. Would appreciate if you would add additional course about emotional help for people who are feeling down due to things happening in their life (break ups, loss of family member, etc.), not neccesserely due to massive disasters.",5
88557,"This course is an easy to follow introduction into the world of PFA based on a well constructed RAPID model and taught by an experienced professor. The nature of presentation using a clear introduction into the topic being taught, a lecture on the topic and clinical vignettes of the right or wrong way to implement what is being taught allow a variety of learners to come away with understanding.",5
88558,I thoroughly enjoyed the course.The course was systematic and ended with clarity.As i had witnessed a natural disaster (Floods) in my hometown I could relate the lesson very much to the disaster. Though I thought I helped victims physically now I know the psychological gaps which I couldn't address then. This course helped me to analyse what I could have done during that crisis.Discussion forum was good in reading fellow coursers view on the case study.Thanks to Professeor Everly and John Hopkins University.Congratulations to all the fellow coursers.,5
88559,It's very interesting course!,5
88560,Excellent course! Delved into the realm of crisis intervention in a comprehensive and logical fashion.,5
88561,Great course!,5
88562,"Great lecturer! Very well put together, clear and concise lessons.",5
88563,amazing and thoughtful,5
88564,"amazing, it was astonishing to see such a soft skills brought to life through eLearning. Great job.",5
88565,Exactly what I was looking for!,5
88566,Explains a very good model which could be adopted and used to train relief workers in terms of providing psychological support in a case of a disaster. Course is structured nicely and provide simulation videos to comprehend the material better.,5
88567,This course is useful not only in the wake of disaster but also helps to have a different look at active listening skills and the people around us.,5
88568,"Excellent course, matched the course description perfectly.",5
88569,"A very basic but thorough introduction to the world of psychological first aid. The class includes a single sample intervention that is referenced at the end of every unit. The actors (including Dr. Everly himself!) seem very well-rehearsed, and this single encounter makes for an excellent template for how to apply the RAPID model in real life!",4
88570,Useful knowledge. Even for everyday life. Take it and learn it !,4
88571,"This course was presented in a very effective manner. Anyone can take this course and walk away with the knowledge necessary to be emphatic in daily life, as well as after a disaster.",5
88572,"A tremendously insightful course, and more relevant than ever as our understanding of disaster situations and mitigating the human cost increases. The acted out scenes were excellent and demonstrated ever so clearly how these interactions unfold. Thank you to the team who put this together and I look forward to future instalments for the university.Kind RegardsJason Canning",5
88573,"Great course that will be quite helpul to me, being in M.A Clinical Psychology.",5

88581,Concise. Would give it 5 starts if there were more simulations.,4
88582,"I am a nursing student and really interested in this course because i think this may help me in my future career. I found this courser is quite helpful and useful, for those who wanna know more about the psychological first aid , you better don't miss this chance.",5
88583,i learned some valuable skills during this course. it was useful for reflection - remembering to look after yourself as well as others is very important. i will definitely be able to use the information and skills along with my medical training in my daily working life. thanks.,4
88584,Great course. I've got a new way to look at things and handle situations.,5
88585,"For me, this course was very much above average. I am overly empathetic and I'm hoping that I've learned to assess a difficult situation without becoming emotionally involved.",5
88586,A very practical and useful course. I do recommend to do it.,5
88587,"It was a very good course - simple but had all essential components.... would have loved it if there were one more simulation for a different situation throughout the course.... Rest, it was a great learning..",4
88588,Incredibly useful course.,5
88589,I really enjoyed this class! I'll try my best to apply everything I learned from this course to the people that I'll be helping and working with...,5
88590,Very informative information that can be used in many instances throughout life.,5
88591,"The course teaches ways to help victims in a disaster situation. Professor Everly's course materials were easy to understand and enjoyable. The quizzes always related directly to the course material, and I feel that I learned what the course set out to teach me. Thank you Prof. Everly!",5
88592,"very useful, especially analyze errors",5
88593,Amazing experience with a lot of demonstrations on the topics and spectacular lectures. I highly recommend it!,5
88594,Good introduction to the subject and importantly leaves you wanting to explore a bit more,4
88595,Exactly what is needed. This is useful even to teach people to listen and be empathetic during day to day life. Great course!,5

88599,lot's of fun. I learned a lot and am now more able to deal with distressed people,5
88600,Very good content. The power points are informative and to the point. The mock scenarios are filmed in a manner that is easy to follow and understand. I got a lot out of this. Thanks!,5
88601,Many Many thanks to Dr. George and Coursera for that I have learned how to behave with people who will go through disasters. It was really meaningful course. My idea has changed now. I feel different.Thank you. I am proud of Coursera.,5
88602,A very informative course!,5
88603,"Thank you for this course, it was really interesting. I will come back to all the materials. Even in everyday life, some of the techniques seem very useful.",5
88604,"Thank you, Dr. Everly and Coursera! This has been a useful and interesting course. It is very well-structured and easy to understand and everyone from real disaster workers to just a person who has everyday life, needs these skills. Thank you for great examples in ""George and Gina"" videos also!",5
88605,"Great course! I think everyone should know this information, if only to know the proper way to help your children or loved ones deal with adversities.Instructor was very good, too.",5
88606,"Dr. Everly's lectures are the best in Coursera so far, in my opinion. PFA is a course that will help millions in those first moments in despair, distress or panic around the world. I strongly recommend it.",5
88607,This course could also perfectly be a self-paced course,4
88608,"Great course a few problems, actually had problems with all video review during tests not playing and only having a blank screen so I wasn't able to review specefic videos through the tests. Loved the senarios though.",4
88609,It's an excellent and really helpful course!,5
88610,I really liked this course. It gave me a lot of useful information about crisis intervention. The lectures bring the reality pretty close and practice simulation videos are extremely helpful in stimulating insights and awareness of delicate details in this support work. Much appreciated. Thank you.,5
88611,"As a Child Protective Services Caseworker, I work with a variety of families who experience psychological crises at various times. The course helped me learn a bit more about how to help my families when they are in need.",5
88612,"Very informative, nice pace and easy to navigate through materials.",5
88613,"Good course that gives valuable tools to anyone, who occasionally have to handle people in life-crisis. Not only related to major disaster events",5
88614,I am very happy to be able to refresh learning more of this skill as I will not know when things can happen. I would like to be able to do something if it does even when there are particular help groups to sweep on the field so to speak..Learning the skills gives me the confidence that I can make a difference however small it may be.THANKS a lot for boosting my knowledge.,4
88615,The course is design so that people with little to none of previous experience on the field of physicology and or crisis intervention may comprehend the basic concepts for Pychological First Aid with enough deapt to actually start applying it. Highly recommended.,5
88616,The PowerPoint slides are informative yet lengthy and boring at times. I hope Coursera can do something to make the lecture more interactive and less monotonous.,4
88617,Great class and something valuable to all people. Very interesting and I highly recommend it.,5
88618,"A very useful course, even for psyhologist! George Everly provides a ton of information which I can use not only as a ""first aid"" tool but also during my ""everyday"" work with patients - for exaple, about rapport, reflective listening and so on. Thanks for this opportunity! It's really great that people can learn this course and learn how to help people in such situations - unfortunately in our modern world some cataclysms, tragedies etc happens often than we would like to... And sory for my bad English!",5
88619,"Informative and helpful. Though it is primarily for disaster survivors, there is good information in here for any crisis intervention.",5
88620,"Amazing course! Exactly what I expected, and more. Thank you for take the time to create a good and understandable course in an engaging way. If you are thinking to make another specialized on this, count me in!I look forward to hear about new courses from Johns Hopkins University.Thank you!Armando",5
88621,"Fantastic, very helpful even for mental health providers!",5
88622,"Excellent lectures, very engaging and motivating!",5
88623,"I'm a newly graduated psychologist and this course had surprised me for some factors. It had broken a paradigm that the PFA it's not therapy! I had a idea that PFA was a sort of psychoteraphy, but I have learned that is not true. Some topics have helped me to better internalize psychology concepts more consciously like the reflective listening that is crucial for any type of mental health intervention.I was surprised when I saw the study where it was proven that the PFA it's more effective than multisession psychoteraphy. Well, it was a course where I had a huge learning.Thank you teacher Everly!",5
88624,"Excellent Course. I wish there was more evaluations or points taken from the videos. Perhaps requirements to evaluate them, compare them and get observations form fellow students and teachers.I noticed that George sometimes had no reaction to Gina n some of the videos and perhaps this was necessary in order to make sure he stood on neutral ground. Like to have had George's thought's on this.Also perhaps one video going through the whole process from beginning to end would have helped show a complete model.But this course is one of the best I have ever taken and I want to thank John Hopkins University and Coursera for providing it.Jack Comer",5
88625,Wonderful course! The material discussed is applicable in all kinds of scenarios not just crisis!,5
88626,A good overview of this important subject which I hope to use in my physical risk management workplace.,4
88627,One of my favourite courses on Coursera. So much so I did it twice :),5
88628,"Exceptional course! Lectures were engaging, informative, and insightful. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who might be thinking about providing assistance in a crisis situation. Furthermore, there are skills taught in this course that prove not only useful in crisis situations but in everyday life as well. Needless to say I am excited to practice what I have learned from this course into any and all situations I may be involved in!",5
88629,I love this course already because it is not difficult to understand and is very useful,5
88630,This course truly changed my way to see the world!,5
88631,"Excellent course, easy to follow while still challenging.",5
88632,"It was a little confusing as to what we were supposed to do with the websites. I know it was an ""optional"" project, but it looks like I can't even go back and complete it, and it seemed like a fun project.",4
88633,"Excellent, simply the best experience of on line education I have had, the course is extremely complete and useful, the support of the staff of mentors is remarkable also, I am extremely grateful.",5
88634,Great course. Whetted my appetite to learn more about python and data visualization.,5
88635,Auto-grading would have been a better option in this course.,4
88636,Dr. Chuck is a most excellent teacher of Python. Makes it easy and entertaining. Highly recommended.,5
88637,"The capstone is great. But I'm not sure it's too easy or not. Maybe for a beginner, the project cannot be too hard. Anyway, I still learned so many from this capstone. I will finish the optional taskes further.",5
88638,"Sorry to say that, but this course has nothing related to programming. I like Dr.Chuck courses, especially 2-4 in this specialization, but this course has no programming challenge and check only your ability to make screenshots. If you have any programming experience you don't need this course it doesn't pay off your time you spend for this. Sorry again, but it's my opinion.",2
88639,"Well structured hands on Python. The tests could be harder :-)Best, Gabriel",5
88640,i hope to learn more how you wrote the code in class.,1
88641,Great Course!!!,5
88642,Had loads of fun :),5
88643,This was a good consolidation of the learning from the previous courses in the specialisation.,5
88644,Good final course,5
88645,Good over capstone coverage for basic python,5
88646,I knew nothing about programming when I started taking this course. Dr. Chuck's textbook and lectures are very fun and easy to understand. Mentors responded quickly and gave us great advice. I learned a lot from this course!,5
88647,Thank you so much.,5
88648,It could be a bit more challenging than just running scripts.,2
88649,"Course is great but I'd prefer that the tasks required writing code or editing the given code to complete the task it'll help more, but over all course was great.",4
88650,Excellent program for people who would like to gain programming skills and learn Python.,5
88651,Very good course .,5
88652,I still think that there is a lot to learn. the fact that I have limited time to complete the tasks made me hurry and not dig deeper into things I would like to.If I could use the forum and ask questions after the course ended it would be better.generally the course is very good for beginners. The instructor is very good and encouraged me to continue learning.,4
88653,"I'd rather have assignments for which you really need to change/write code, not just run existing one. Otherwise the course by itself is great.",3
88654,No new learning during this course. Working on the capstone project is practically optional.,2
88655,Sorry folks but we are not learning much here,2
88656,ENJOYED IT!!! Dr Chuck fantastic mentor!,5
88657,"Chuck is a very good teacher. The course is gradually increasing difficulty, but always entertained and understandable. The good sense of humor and the special get together of Chuck with students around the wqorld, makes a plus.",5
88658,"Although it does not contain new content, it puts all the content from the specialization together. It could be more challenging.",4
88659,A nice way to sum it all up and see the potential.,4
88660,Really motivating learning experience. Huge thanks to Dr. Chuck!,5
88661,"Not good enough. Only run, run, run, and less participation than courses before. Add some wrong code to correct may be better",3
88662,Thanks Professor Charles!,5
88663,Thanks to Dr. Chuck.,5
88664,A great course which provides lots of cool stuff such as visualization of data.,5
88665,Not the quality i expected. The capstone project should have been little more challenging and something new.,2
88666,Fantastic and Practical,5
88667,its definitely worth ending the specialization with this capstone. The quizzes are easy but I would recommend watching all the videos to understand how all the pieces fit together. The biggest takeaway for me was to see how the database size significantly shrinks when its normalized during the clean up process.,5
88668,Great place to begin learning Python.,5
88669,"Dr Chuck's final lecture with Python. A very large course to discover and use this precise and intelligent language. Congratulations to dr.Chuck for his educational qualities, what a talent!",5
88670,I thought this was a good course. Dr. Chuck goes through an interesting example of going through email data and there is plenty of time to do your own project.,3
88671,"This is an excellent introductory course to computer programming. It gives you all the opportunities to learn at your own pace.It is not too difficult to clear the capstone itself, but the course gives you the opportunity to chose your own project which makes it all the more interesting.",4
88672,This is a very good specialization course for beginners.,5
88673,"There was not the same application of programming skills as in the previous courses. Also, this course started too late after the other courses and I lost a lot of momentum in completing coursework.",2
88674,This course is made so that you create something on your own if you just want to pass the assignments then the course won't be a challenge but if the projects are interesting to you and you want to do something creative then you have the right course .,4
88675,It is a very light course!,3
88676,The assignments were not challenging enough.,2
88677,"It was a very good course. However I would like we were need to code a little bit more. I know it´s up to us how much we do and how difficult we do our task, but I would be nice if we had to write a bit more on the assignments.",4
88678,Great course and great infromation from Dr Chuck again makes this an interesting course to do. Worth trying to find some data that you are interested in exploring going into this course and making time to spend on it. This part of the course is well paced so you can spend time on your own project work to run in conjunction with the lectures and assignments.,5
88679,"This is really really good course to learn data retrieving, visualization and processing, professor is awesome and the way he explain about such knowledge is really really awesome.",5
88680,Overall an outstanding introduction to Python,5
88681,"Easy course to bookend the specialization. I am using some of the visualizations knowledge to develop my own projects. Thanks, Dr. Chuck.",5
88682,One of the greatest journeys I have taken. I didn't expect to go this far. But the love for python and content of this course made it possible. I am full-time student and barely can take an extra class. This was my extra class. One step each time till its complete. I highly recommend this course for anyone who wants to learn python.,5
88683,"Not as much practical as the other Python courses provided in this series. The coding assignment is quite easy, since the code has been already written, the ONLY thing you have to do is RUN IT...",3
88684,I expected some more coding in the capstone rather than just apply code that has already been written,3
88685,"This course was really a fun to solve some real-time problem, to play with some real time data and put my first step towards data-analysis. I really enjoyed it a lot!",5
88686,"Very good course, though a bit less challenging than I have expected. A true capping of the previous courses.",4
88687,Exceptional Learning opportunity,5
88688,Great,5
88689,"The sample solution and explanations are very good since it gives a complete whole picture of doing a big data analysis project. The assignment is very easy, but good to get the specialization.",4
88690,Really interesting!,5
88691,Good to review all specialization courses subjects!,5
88692,"I learned to understand the structure of the algorithm, several codes are given only one solution, that with the support of java, shtml, CSS can be visualized data to make minor changes to the code and change the visualization.Writing code Dr. complicated but when we look at you see the familiar approaches to writing and take them to his application.Thank you!",5
88693,Instructive as well as enjoyable.,5
88694,Could have been more hands on.,3
88695,This projects in this course tested all the knowledge that i had acquired before. The projects were challenging enough and well prepared.,4
88696,Great course!,5
88697,"Nice course, yet more hands on work was expected.",3
88698,Love Dr. Chuck!!!!,5
88699,Thanks,5
88700,Much enjoyable that I expected.,5
88701,A perfect ending!,5
88702,awesome experience :),5
88703,"The Capstone was adequate, but I had hope for a bit more of a challenge. The specialization all together helped me get a better grip on Python Basics.",3
88704,what a great specialization and series of courses... highly recommend!,5
88705,A great finish to the specialization. A very 'free form' approach to the final project allowed students to develop and demonstrate projects in areas that interested them. The instructor (Dr Chuck) is the most engaged and engaging teacher I have come across on Coursera. His live 'graduation' ceremony was a first!,5
88706,I liked reading code for the entirety of this course. I'm glad I went through all the lessons in the series and ended with the capstone course. This course is really helpful because I can see how I can use ideas from this course to work on my own projects.,5
88707,The things that can be built with the skills we developed throughout the specialization are amazing.,5
88708,Thank you very much! :-),5
88709,"The final course in the specialization, we have to learn to use our skills to do projects. Less of coding and more application of knowledge. We can choose to quickly get a certificate or immerse in the experience.",5
88710,Best course to learn python and handling data structures using python.,5
88711,"Excellent course and introduction to processing and visualizing data with Python. Although, most of the code was provided and students only needed to modify and tinker with the scripts, this allowed focusing on the output and visualizations. And having the scripts, the student is free to continue pulling down data and practicing their visualization projects.",5
88712,"For me personally, this is a great closing for this specialization! Thanks Dr. Chuck and his associates!",5
88713,"Thank you, Dr. Chuck, for an amazing course! Thank you, Coursera Team, for an amazing platform to learn!",5
88714,Don't miss the online graduation ceremony!,5
88715,"I suggest to add the option to allow some students write project code on their own, instead of just read and run.",4
88716,I would strongly recommend for those interested in learning python. I will give 100% + rating to Dr Chuck. he is the one of the best teacher i have ever found.,5
88717,"The only thing I had to do in this course regarding the required assignments was to change python 2.7 code to 3.4 as that's what I'm using.Presentations didn't add much towards the learning either. Definite downgrade from previous courses, especially from the first three.",2
88718,One of a kind!,5
88719,"I thought this was poor. It was basically a re-hash of the previous module with slightly different tasks. Given that I had to wait three months for the capstone to be ready, I found it a bit rich that my deadline to finish it was a couple of weeks! Don't waste your money/time on this particular module.",1
88720,Coursework was quite easy. Used a lot of the techniques learned in the other courses. You'll get the most out of this course if you have a data analysis project that you want to do. For us this wasn't required. But doing my own project was the most fun part :),4
88721,I really enjoyed this course. I recommend it to anyone that wants to be challenged to utilize and improve an Architecture with Python.,5
88722,Many thanks to Professor Chuck that put so much effort on this course.,4
88723,Good course for understanding Programming!!!Daler,5
88724,"You are not actually writing any code for this particular course. The assignments are just taking screenshots of running code that is already provided to you in the code repository for this course. The lectures are great, there is a lot to learn from them but the assignments are a total bust. Not worth it for the money, but go for it if you want to complete the entire specialization",3
88725,"good way of explaning all the process from web scraping/mining/crawling to final clean vizualtion,thanks a lot!",5
88726,"Capstone was great, although I would have learnt stuff better if there was a small battle from the deadlines and the curriculum in particular. This was a fun specialization and am looking forward to graduate soon! Thanks Dr. Chuck :)Cheers!",3
88727,"I really didn't learn much. Too much code, too complex, too fast.",3
88728,"As a captstonse course I expected this to be more challenging than other courses in the specialisation, especially the assignments which should have required to put in some real effort rather than simply executing pre-written scripts and uploading screenshots. Rest of the courses in the specialisation were superb, combined with the awesome teaching skills of Dr. Chuck but capstone was quite disappointing unfortunately.",2
88729,I wish it was more hands on.,4
88730,Very few amount of exercise and very small gain of knowledge from Capstone.,2
88731,Love it,5
88732,"It was worth taking just for the code examples and understanding the how to combine multiple process and applications. This course overall was great and provided the right combinations to ensure success such as appropriate timelines, content, and costs.",5
88733,I expected something else.,1
88734,"I am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding, but there wasn't any. In any case, thanks Dr Chuck! :-)",3
88735,I expected more practical exercises. but I did learn some,2
88736,It was such an awesome specialization. It really opened my eyes to a lot of Python :D,5
88737,In this course Dr. Chuck will teach you how to visualize data and work with it.You can't miss it.,5
88738,"The course offers just a simple running of (interesting and useful) code, but doesn't put the student in the situation of thinking and creating ideas and code.",2
88739,"Good professor, great course, great specialization!",5
88740,"thank you ,Dr.chuck",5
88741,"Python for everyone is One of the Best Course on MOOC platform .Dr. Chuck made it interesting and Knowledgeable. Way back 3 Months ,I can't even thing of the stuff that I leaned and implemented .",5
88742,Not much coding to do here - but a lot to understand in terms of getting data - treating it and then using it.Thanks You Dr. Chuck!Will be waiting for further courses from you!,5
88743,5 stars for inspiring gazillion confidence with the exercises3 stars for not pushing us hard during capstoneMean of 4Nah !! Actually 5 Its perfect !,5
88744,"If this entire specialization were a bag of potato chips, the Capstone would be that bland chip that didn't get any salt.The introduction to the Capstone promises that we'll ""build applications"" utilizing what we've learned so far with optional assignments for delving deeper. However, none of the required assignments involve even the most primitive of problem solving skills or code writing abilities. If you can download a file and take a screenshot then you've got what it takes to pass this class.The optional assignments are far too focused around a new piece of video sharing technology that the instructor and associates have developed. Unfortunately, the technology adds almost nothing beneficial to the class and is probably to blame for the sheer lack of quality in the rest of the class.In fact, the entire Capstone feels like it was so haphazardly put together that it can only be described as the most contrived beta-test I've ever been a part of. Such a disappointing ending to what was otherwise an enjoyable specialization.",1
88745,Too easy. :),4
88746,The professor makes it easy to follow. I appreciate it.,4
88747,"A year after this course, I am pursuing my masters in Philosophy now. :-)",5
88748,Intriguing from the very first lecture to even all the internal and external assignments attached by the professors. Thank you!,5
88749,Nice easy course to break yourself into philosophy and the study of it.,5
88750,"I like this course a lot and have spent several days following all the lectures, for a feeling that the whole course is formulated not with a historical/overwhelmed view but aims to inspire a true interest in the ways of thinking. A discursive thought path and I've really enjoyed it. Thank you for your sharing knowledge and kind design. Besides, the materials for independent learning are good guide! At least, I know where to find trustworthy information. THANKS!",5
88751,Great course.Great to the starting philosopher. And anyone who wants to learn a bit more about how we all think!,5
88752,"I've enjoyed this course greatly, and look forward to delve further into philosophy. I loved all of the talks by all the lecturers, and found their follow-up videos to be particularly helpful. Unfortunately, that also meant that there was no forum to access and discuss the questions posed by the lectures with other people taking the course, which I believe would have helped to hone my argumentative skills, which I believe is necessary to have (and further develop and enhance), when learning about philosophy.Thank you very much for this amazing course. If you could introduce more philosophy courses (particularly ones that are more advanced and in depth), that would be great!",5
88753,Loved this course very much. The professors truly allowed the student to understand the material fully with a great amount of quiz's and assignments.,5
88754,"It is very complete and wide in the optional themes treated on the course. Also you are provided with link to forums, debates, guides, and bibliography to investigate further more what caught your interest. Highly recommended!!",5
88755,Very good and informative course. I enjoyed being forced to think outside the box :),5
88756,Very interesting course. Already started to look for another one from Edinburgh University. Great job!,5
88757,We well designed course.,5
88758,A very resourceful and mind-opening course. Need to take more time to absorb it. Thanks for all the professors making it.,5
88759,"Was a pleasure to study. I feel this was a satisfactory entry into the study of philosophy. I quite enjoyed the final portions in week five, particularly that of Sir Richard, and his discussion of the logic of time travel.",4
88760,Great course!,5
88761,it is good to know real knowledge not just biased and religious or cultural,5
88762,Gives a very brief and intelligible introduction to philosophy. The course eliminates the need for previous experience with the subject,5
88763,"This course is really interesting and motivating. Even though it has a very short time for a very complex subject, the different professors have made their best to give a summary which is as complete as possible, being clear and understable at the same time.I have used mainly the recommended textbook (which I recommend strongly), more than the videos, but the videos are more than enough to understand every session.If someone is looking for simple answers to complex questions, this is not the course for him/her. But if you want a quick summary of some of the main views related to different philosophical problems, and could be interested in looking for additional information through the recommended bibliography, this course could be a very good starting point.The possible drawbacks, in my view, would be:1) The lack of discussion forums.2) There is very little time for every philosophical problem. It would be really useful to widen the contents of the course using the Bibliography, mainly the online resources.",5
88764,"I really loved this course, very interesting and pleasant! Many thanks to all the professors!",5
88765,I appreciate how some of my messy thoughts about the world is organized and justified when I finished this course. I would like to learn some more advanced courses because there are still many unanswered questions.,5
88766,Good one Dave,5
88767,Good course!,5
88768,"Good course, enjoyed the lectures.",5
88769,A fair chance to broaden. Thank you all for the travel.,5
88770,Great course to the introduction to philosophy. It opens a door for philosophical curious outsiders.,5
88771,Nice introduction in basic philosophical concepts.,4
88772,"wonderful course. very interesting and thought provoking, thank you!",5
88773,"good course, just needs to be a little more thorough",4
88774,Amazing course.,5
88775,"This was a very good introduction. Many important philosophical concepts are explored with very well thought out examples, and the quizzes really make you reflect on what you have learned.",5
88776,"Excellent course, one of the better I have attended. Congratulations to the course staff and to Coursera for the initiative.",5
88777,"Teachers are really responsive to questions that were mentioned in the forum, and they provided me with a good start in philosophy. I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in philosophy but has no previous experience. This course will lead you to the a different world.",5
88778,"Well prepared materials that provide simple, basic understanding of philosophy. Great effort from the team! Big thanks!",5
88779,"A short course but introduces several areas of Philosophy. Every week there are new concepts introduced and its very interesting to listen to the teachers. Thank you University of Edinburgh, the teachers and Coursera for this good course.",5
88780,"Fun, informative course that doesn't take too much time. I would suggest it for people who are new to learning Philosophy, because it may be too simple for people with a decent knowledge of philosophy.",4
88781,"Very good and interesting course, esp. time travel and political obligation units",5
88782,"Great course, it exposed me to quite a few ideas but i only felt that we could've gone deeper into the topics. For an introductory course, it was quite informative though!",4
88783,"Well structured course, great instructors, they master the subject and make the course a really enjoyable one.",5
88784,Actually I have enjoyed the course . I have learned about the problems were asked by previous philosophers and about how to think correctly by analyzing the prefaces to get logical results .,5
88785,Great theories. Thoughtful. Many different perspective from philosophers on a topic. There are options of the course each week for your interest. Great explanation. Gain a lot of knowledge from this class.,5
88786,"My English and thought process was challenged, and I enjoyed it :-)",4
88787,"Really interesting course, led me to take a module in philosophy at University.",5
88788,Very good course and lecturers,5
88789,Great course,5
88790,"Thoroughly enjoyable with all the different lecturers . I related to a lot of philosophers . Made me wish i could belong to an era where i could make use of all that was learnt and discovered and theorized at that time. It was rather brief , though. I mean there's no way to explain it all an stick to the guidelines that fit the coursera code , but enjoyable none the less. Makes you really want to scratch your brain and question everything , which I personally , believe is always a good thing.",4
88791,This course is an excellent introduction to philosophy. It is short but ripe.,5
88792,Where is the course discussion forum? It definitely needs one!Why was determinism taken as granted in the lectures? It is a highly disputed topic which undermines most of the free will arguments that were shown.,4
88793,There were a number of different instructors and it was great to have a taste of varying topics from them.,3
88794,Very good introduction to philosophy. The professors share simple and effective analogies to explain philosophical concepts. The concepts are also woven into interesting topics that would make one think. Highly recommend this course to everyone.,5
88795,Never thought I would be interested in philosophy - that was the start of my adventure.,4
88796,Such a good course!,4
88797,"This is an excellent course but some complex topics could have been explained more like Quantum indeterminacy and the time / travel part to help the new person grasp the idea. However, its an excellent course to start with!!",4
88798,it was a good course,4
88799,"Dave is a great narrator. He talks in an impressive way. So, everyone who watches the videos can understand it more easily. In addition to videos, there are also helpful documents. It was a very enjoyable course for me. :)",5
88800,Very good as a broad introduction.,4
88801,Nice intro to topic,4
88802,i learned so much <3,5
88803,"This Philosophy course is perfect for those who want to get familiar with current philosophical discussions. They provide you with a very general view of a variety of philosophical debates in a very easy manner, so that anybody can understand them.",5
88804,"I loved taking this course, although at the end it became a little difficult for me to understand the accent of that Italian Professor (for me particulally it would be easier if she spoke Italian, it's my second mother tongue!). It was the hardest test because I couldn't understand very well. But in general terms it was very nice! Thank you and congratulations.",5
88805,"It was amazing, It contained the basics of a very wide area of knowledge",4
88806,"Excellent course and I must write that I am appalled that the forum has been so abused by some, that it has to be discontinued. This is a horrid manifestation of hatefulness.",5
88807,"It is a short course that covers fewer topics than what you would expect in a normal offline freshman philosophy course. However, the content is very interesting and well-organized.",5
88808,Too complicated for those who are new to philosophy. The basic concepts not very clearly explained. It seems that teachers had the assumption that students already had some previous knowledge of philosophy.,3
88809,Wonderful introduction to philosophy! Even Schopenhauer would be happy with it!,5
88810,Great Course !!,5
88811,Excellent course! Very interesting topics. Very well explained.,5
88812,Very well made introductory course,4
88813,Good food for thought,3
88814,This course teach you how important is to have philosophical mind.The overview of what philosophy is in the first lecture is awesome. In further lectures they go into tools of philosophy and major questions and arguments for them.But you have to read the hand outs and have to work yourself through the course.,3
88815,Very interesting and thought-provoking!,4
88816,The course was really interesting. The modules were taught by different professors. They were all very engaging. And I specially liked Professor Michela Massimi and Dr. Dave Ward.,5
88817,"I loved it, everything made absolute sense and was explained perfectly",5
88818,"This course gave me a basic academic knowledge of my favourite subject, philosophy.",5
88819,I enjoy all the information. thanks,5
88820,"Our mission for this module is to try and understand a little bit about what philosophy, as a subject, actually is. What makes it different from other subjects? What are its distinctive aims and methods? We'll think about two claims that are often made about philosophy: that it deals with questions that are, in some sense, fundamental; and that it deals with questions that are of some special importance. We'll also look at how philosophy is actually practiced by exploring some of the criteria philosophers bring to bear when assessing the success of philosophical arguments. Finally, we'll finish by briefly thinking about how two very influential philosophers - David Hume (1711-1776) and Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) - attempted to answer the question of how we can know whether, in any given case, there really is a right way of looking at things.ResourcesA handout for this module is here.A large format handout for this module is here.AssessmentIn addition to the in-video quizzes, there is a short review quiz for this module's material. Also, why not take some time to introduce yourself to your coursemates on the discussion forums, and chat about the lectures from this module. Did anything not make sense? Was there anything you found especially interesting? How would you answer some of the questions raised in the lecture?Additional ResourcesThere is an interesting selection of philosophers attempting to give their own definitions of philosophy at Philosophy Bites, here.For a detailed historical survey of different conceptions of philosophy have a look at this article from the Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy.Both of these are excellent resources, and well worth browsing for material relevant to the rest of the course.If you'd like to think more about the argument concerning free will, then this Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy article is a good place to start.If you would like to read more about Hume and his work have a look at this article from the Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy, as well as this article from the Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy. Moreover, If you fancy having a go at reading some of Hume's works you can find selected texts at this page, part of Jonathan Bennett's fantastic project Early Modern Texts.If you would like to read more about Kant and his work have a look at this article from the Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy. Selected works of Kant can also be found at Early Modern Texts. Be warned, however, they can be pretty heavy going!For a slightly more irreverent view on Hume, Kant, and the question 'Why do philosophy?' have a listen to the linked podcasts from The Partially Examined Life. Warning: contains occasional strong language!",5
88821,Good Introduction!,4
88822,Thoroughly enjoyed the course!,5
88823,Thoroughly enjoyed the course!,5
88824,"It'd be a lot more fun, if you also present a sequel of the current course !!",5
88825,Very well presented and structured course. I found the subjects to be deeply interesting and it stimulated my thinking. Food for the mind.,5
88826,"Great teachers, very interesting subjects!I've learned a lot from this course!",5
88827,it helps me a lot in my studies....upon enrolling this online course it's a big help in my Philosophy subject here in my school. hope that you may continue to help more student like me.,5
88828,"I found this course very interesting, informative, and engaging. The instructors and lectures are interesting, and the topics covered are fascinating. The quizzes cover the most important concepts of the course without being unnecessarily difficult. I have recommended this course more than once already, and would do so again. If I found that another course were created to follow this one, I would definitely take it.",5
88829,"I have enjoyed this course from the first class; it shows the philosophy as a set of ideas we may discuss using logic and not as a set of dates and Names attached to the Books. The professors are brilliant, lectures neither intimidated nor oversimplified.",5
88830,"for a ESL student, its really a challenge for me, but i am glad i have passed it, thank you all--the teachers, and the mentors, what an experience! since this is my first course, i'll continue my 2nd, and 3rd course, good luck to you!",5
88831,Excellent introduction to the basics of philosophy. Lecturers are really good.,5
88832,"The Teacher´s are amazing, the help material is very completed.I very happy for this course.Thanks by share your knowledge with us.",5
88833,This is absolutely fantastic course. Thank you very much for offering it! The course content is very good and there pointers to enormous amount of very enlightening literature!,5
88834,"This courses is a nice broad though light introduction to a series of current topics in Philosophy, introduced by philosopher focused in those topics.",5
88835,A wonderful brief journey to the wonder of philosophy. I am glad I took the course,5
88836,I would suggest this really very good introductory course as a starting point to everyone interested in different philosophical questions.,5
88837,It really helped me a lot.,5
88838,"Interesting, and well worth my time... I only give it four stars as I am kinda stingy.. ;)",4
88839,Its a great course. I am happy to learn more philosopy for my activity of professor.,5
88840,"It's a great introductory course to the seemingly difficult subject philosophy. After finishing this course, I find that philosophy is indeed a quite interesting and useful subject that relates with everyday life. People who have not studied philosophy yet are actually using them everyday; some of the topics philosophy regards are quite relative to our daily life, at least it is the case for me. I think it might be better if this course can have a better category of the topics taught in it, because sometimes I am confused with what this topic is actually a philosophical subject. If I can see clearly where this specific topic is in the huge subject philosophy, it would definitely benefit me a lot for my future study and research!",5
88841,"A Philosophy SamplerA wonderful introduction to philosophy. Seven outstanding teachers each providing a sample of their areas of specialization. Plenty of follow up material if you want to go deeper into any specialization. At the end of the course, there is even a chance to write your own 750 word philosophical submission.",5
88842,Very memorable and very educational. I learned more about the topic with these modules.,5
88843,Very interesting,5
88844,Great introduction to Philosophy! I think the last couple of weeks could've been done a bit better as they're quite niche forms of philosophy but other than that it's great.,4
88845,Great general introduction to Philosophy. I suggest taking this philosophy course before any others because it puts a lot into perspective and it gives you a good idea of what path to take in your personal studies in philosophy and beyond.,5
88846,Was excellent. Content and layout,5
88847,"I liked this course because of the calmness and dedication of the teachers, the reliability of the resources and the attractive topics that were selected.Although I must recognize that sometimes the long extension of the additional resources didn't allow me to read them all.Despite of that, the course was great and I enjoyed it.",4
88848,Great introduction to general philosophy topics.,5
88849,"I've never taken a philosophy course because it seemed difficult to understand. However, the lecturers explained the concepts and theory clearly. This course has increase my understanding of philosophy and how applicable it is in other fields. I really enjoyed the course and recommend it!!!",5
88850,I thought that this course was a very good introduction. It gave brief glimpses into different kinds of philosophy.,5
88851,"I mean, I'm only two weeks in and already there's so much to know and it's all so interesting so I think it's a completely worthwhile course (even though I'm only 2 weeks in)",5
88852,"Great for Philosophy beginners, but it does require a lot a alone reflection in order to apprehend the concepts. Give it an enthusiastic shot.",5
88853,"Awesome experience for me, awesome handouts and awesome lecturers!",5
88854,Very nice! Understood a lot about Philosophy. Thank you!,5
88855,Interesting and well prepared course.,5
88856,"Well organized content, excellent instructors! Easy and fun!",5
88857,"very interesting course, it provides several question and relative theory in history. And it would make you to think. So i like this course.",5
88858,"Good course. It covers various disciplines in philosophy (e.g. of science, of mind, ethics), with interesting presentation and discussion topics. However it doesn't feel very systematic. It feels more like a series of videos about philosophy than a holistic course at philosophy.",4
88859,This is a very good and interesting course. The instructors lecture the course from an easy way to understand. I hope that they will open an advanced course for this field.,5
88860,There are many more interesting themes in philosophy,4
88861,Pretty awesome course!,5
88862,Brilliant course. Not a simple 'history of philosophy' this course jumps into some very interesting topics and engages you fully.,5
88863,This is an outstanding introduction to Philosophy. Each element is a short overview at beginner level and yet addresses the fundamental debates in each area covered.,5
88864,A good introduction to philosophy. Also a life changing experience to start think the whys of everything you do. I recommend this to everyone.,5
88865,"Great course, excellent topics... they are about interesting themes and questions in the world. Thanks",5
88866,"Great course from one of the top universities in the world! Deep throughout, fast-paced but easy to understand, this course will give you a first impression of what Philosophy really is, making you want to delve more into this awesome world of thinking.I highly recommend it!",5
88867,Excellent course. Really enjoyed it.,5
88868,Great course for someone who has never had a Philosophy course,5
88869,"It is a simple and generic overview of some of the areas in philosophy, mostly contemporary philosophy. It allows me to explore some basic ideas and concepts without going too deep, which is great because it is what I am looking forward to in this course. Thank you professors, I appreciate your efforts in making the lecture appealing and reflective ( by visiting museums, wearing clocks/watches, visiting graves haha ). :)",4
88870,"great, perhaps the tests doesn't work very well",4
88871,easy to understand and interesting!!!,5
88872,An excellent course providing a great overview of major philosophical ideas and arguments.,5
88873,It is a deeply interesting course. I really enjoied. Thank you very much!,5
88874,It's pretty good.,5
88875,Wonderful and challenging...,5
88876,excellent quality of study material,5
88877,very nice introductory course looking at questions of,4
88878,"Very good information, thank you so much for all experience gained through this course.",5
88879,"The course material is mostly good if a bit basic at times. If the notes went a little more in depth, or the suggested resources were a little less bulky, it would be 5 stars.",4
88880,A very good introduction.,5
88881,Very interesting course. I am learning a lot.,5
88882,Amazing course. I hope it can be extended to a more advanced level and I also hope the MOOC about philosophy and the sciences will be back soon. All the best,5
88883,From an engineer perspective this was hard to see obvious value in but i enjoyed the thought provoking topics. Some of the tests were very hard and the questions were not directly form the lectures while others were. Some presenters were hard to understand due to accent.,4
88884,"Very well done. Most of the instructors use introductory language and do not refer to advanced theories, philosophies, and philosophers with which students may not be familiar.",4
88885,"Some brilliant videos, but some leave much to be desired. Nice introduction but don't get too hung up on it.",3
88886,Informative and engaging!,5
88887,fantastic and thorough introduction to some fascinating aspects of philosophy,5
88888,This course provides a comfortable introduction to the subjects of each module. My only dissatisfaction with the course lies in its brevity; I would happily retake a future offering of the course which included not only additional modules but also further lectures on related survey topics within each module so as to acquaint students to greater breadth in historical and contemporary philosophy.,4
88889,"A good course. However, I would expect more coherence between the different modules discussed. In its current structure, the course represents a glance at an arbitrary selection of several topics (unrelated to e, existing in today's philosophy, rather than a coherent introduction into the broad discipline of philosophy. However, this may be just a matter of approach - this approach is also perfectly valid.",3
88890,Loved it. The lecturers are very informative and the concepts are passed in a very easy tone.,5
88891,"Probably I am biased by just having followed edX's Minds and Machines. Compared to that course, the lectures here are superficial and not very engaging. This becomes especially striking for overlapping topics between the two courses. Also the quizzes are way too easy and you can try until you get it right. This makes the certificate virtually worthless, although you can pay for it.",2
88892,Very informative and engaging. Covers a wide range of material without feeling cumbersome.,4
88893,"Good course, very arbitrary chosen topics though",4
88894,Nice introduction to the subject and I'm just taking one point off for the organisation of the material presented.,4
88895,This course is informative and enjoyable. I would highly recommend it to anyone interest in Philosophy!,5
88896,"An interesting overview, but I wish it had been a bit more rigorous.",3
88897,"Very good introduction to philosophy. The amount of work and care that was used to create this course is clearly visible in the videos with the speakers, backgrounds, video and sound quality. Thanks very much!",4
88898,"is a very good course to start in the world of think,",4
88899,A very clear discription to the basics of philosophy - I am happy that I have joined the course!,4
88900,"Greatly enjoyed this introduction to philosophy - appropriately brief, but insightful, engaging, broad and thought provoking!",5
88901,"Really good course! Very much enjoyed it! Thank you for an amazing month! The only thing I would mention, was that at times the computer would sometime move the selected answer on the quiz, which made it frustrating on the last week's quiz and on week 2 (or 3 I think, can't remember it correctly) when it occurred, but apart from that everything else was fine! Thank you!",5
88902,"Great course not only for those interested in philosophy, but also for the ones skeptical about its importance. Beginner - friendly :)",5
88903,It took me a long time due to time limitation but happy to finish. I learned a lot and love to go back and listen to the lessons again and again.,5
88904,I have really enjoyed this course and it has motivated me to learn more. I particularly liked the course as it showed us philosophy itself rather than a reiterated history of philosophy which is usual. It gave us hands on experience of problems and questions being asked.The accompanying book has also been of great value to me. It enabled me to read the lectures before listening to them and will be a useful handbook to keep me in touch with the issues covered. The questions and further reading at the end of each chapter is also of great value to me.A big thank you to all the team. I have been totally absorbed by the course.,5
88905,This is an enjoyable course that covers a few of the basic ideas in philosophy and how to think philosophically.,5
88906,"In as much as I enjoyed the course at times the dialect was difficult. However, the reason for 4 stars as opposed to 5 stars is due to a lack of ability to have receive an answer to a difficult question answered by an instructor as opposed to another class participant who necessarily did not have any better grasp of the question than myself. Given that I certainly enjoyed the course overall.",4
88907,i love the art the love and all thee harmony in this picture!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
88908,So far it is brilliant. Loved Dr Pritchard's lecture on Gettier Cases.,5
88909,Very useful and helpful for a beginner. Learned a lot.,5
88910,"I took this course just to listen to the lectures as an intro to the subject. One of the prof's accent was so heavy that I couldn't understand her well enough to listen to her lectures so had to skip that part. Other than that, it was enjoyable. I don't know if it was a good intro or not, complete enough or whatever... but it was generally interesting.",4
88911,It is really a good place to start orienting oneself with the scholarly tradition of philosophy.,5
88912,"I almost gave this two stars, but the content of the course is excellent, and I didn't want to take away from that. To start off, for an introductory class, this covers a large amount and variety of material. It might be better served to break it up into even smaller sections over the course of something like ten weeks or even twelve instead of cramming it all into seven weeks.The lectures are enjoyable, but often they consist of nothing but the professor speaking. There are so many new terms, definitions, and ideas being introduced that it would help if these lectures also included slides or graphs with some of these ideas being broken down, as you would have in a regular class on a projector or on a chalkboard.Frequently, the practice quizzes are just the same questions from the video lectures repeated over again, and offer very little prep for the actual quizzes, which are painfully pedantic for a non-credit course. Every section has a different style of quiz, which is hard to prepare for. I am someone who usually tests well and have been struggling with most of these, even when I read all of the handouts and take notes.So, if this same course could be broken up over a slightly longer time and the quizzes could be more uniform, the lectures contained some slides, the course would be a brilliant introduction to philosophy overall. It's got all of the meat there, the presentation just makes it tough to digest.",3
88913,"This course is excellent! The instructors are very interesting, the topics covered are fun to learn, and the course format is very manageable.",5
88914,"Great lectures and nicely explained, apart from one lecture (6th - maybe it was me, not understanding the topic properly). For the future, I suggest to have more ""visible"" support of the lecturers; lecturers should address us directly and enage us more to interact with the content as well as our classmates. Moreover, and I am speaking subjectivily, I found all topics very simple. To deepen my understand, I would suggest to have compulsory essays to elaborate the aquired knowledge.Thank you for your effort!",4
88915,The course was interesting but overall very wide and didn't make a clear point.,3
88916,Very helpful introductory course for people who are interested in philosophy. Varied topics in each module and rich reference reading materials. The only problem I found is the lectures in some modules are too simple and not as inspiring and thought-provoking as some others.,4
88917,Very interesting,5
88918,Really helpful and gives me the overall idea of what philosophy is! I even applied for university of Edinburgh after taking this course.,5
88919,"A very good introduction to major branches of Philosophy. While some questions on assignments were rather vague, and some lectures rather dull (I don't think I bothered watching the videos from the third week on... just relied on the- excellently put together!- handouts). Overall, a great course to take for a beginner to the world of Philosophy :D",4
88920,"Fully satisfied with this course. Very good program and content, good videos, professional teachers... I really learned a lot. I recommend the course 100 %",5
88921,Good course.,5
88922,good course,5
88923,It was very interesting and of great relevance to many aspect of my fields of interest. They even had a special lecture on the philosophy of time travel that was a cherry on top of the cake!,4
88924,"Great introductory course, although somewhat short. I wish there would be more lectures, especially by prof. Michela Massimi. I will definitely take the ""Philosophy and the Sciences"" course, which seems to broaden some of the themes touched upon the week 6 of this MOOC. I am also looking forward for other courses by the University of Edinburgh.",4
88925,Awesome Course!,5
88926,"Very good, too short though",4
88927,Simply GREAT!,5
88928,"A nice and flexible course, in which you can explore the wide range of possibilities from the minimum basic level of subject to studying all the additional material and problematics. Rather interesting functional approach to the structure of philosophical knowledge. For the foreigners (as I am) the English is quite understandable (It is subtitled, but the subtitles are not necessary if you are above B2 / IELTS 7.0 level) and at the same time sufficiently sophisticated to acquire also some useful listening practice for academic IELTS / PTE Academic tests.",5
88929,"Wonderful course! I especially enjoyed the Time Travel modules, as I am a huge science fiction fan. The instructors are informative and thought-provoking.",5
88930,Very intuitive.,5
88931,"Two last lectures (week 6 and 7) are the most informative ones, giving a large pool of sources and information in an excellently structured way. It would be nice to expand bibliography for other lectures and add handout or transcript for week 4 because I actually was studying the materials, not watching videos. Thank you!",4
88932,cornhub mmm.,5
88933,"I have a mixed feeling about it. Sometimes I felt, this course was trying to deliver more content in short time.",3
88934,Useful and simple. All things that a philosophy student needs.,4
88935,"This was a fantastic course! The content was very interesting, especially the section on time-travel, which I absolutely loved. I also liked that the course was perfectly manageable, unlike all the other MOOC's that I have attempted, where the time commitment turns out to be much bigger than expected.",5
88936,"Very good course, it perfectly introduces some of the most relevant topics in philosophical discussion, some are new some are very very old but still fascinating. I would strongly recommend this course for anyone interested in learning about philosophy, history and culture in general.",5
88937,"Excellent first week! Promises to be a very interesting course. Unfortunately, I won't get back to it for a while, due to other pressing projects, but I'm looking forward to exploring it more later in the year.",5
88938,"I gave this course 5 stars because the content does match the description, a general overview of the topic of Philosophy. It introduces the student to the concepts involved with the study of and the approach to Philosophy from various topics. It does not go into any specific philosophers very deeply, and instead focuses on the general study or overview of what is going on in the ""philosophical world"" as of 2013. The course has not been updated, from what I can tell from that time.The Forums are ""there"" and the class is ""supposed"" to be live, but it did not have that feel to it. It was more of a ""study on your own"" experience and yes, we have a forum area. i found it not to be very active after the first week, (introductions were encouraged) but perhaps taking this course over the Christmas holiday (that fell in the middle of the course) was not the best time. I am near the end of the course and have put a lot of time effort and extra reading into it, but it does not seem this will be rewarded i.e by a certificate with distinction, at least there does not seem to be active involvement to that extent. 2-3 of the lectures had ""extra""videos"" of the professors addressing forum questions, but I do think these were outdated or from the first run of the course (?) as they seems to be talking about topics that were not necessarily in the forums at the time. I cannot determine that for certain, but, it was my impression.I would HIGHLY suggest purchase of the book that goes with this course, due to week 6, when clearly the topic is not entirely covered in the notes nor the lecture (my opinion only) and the book was needed to get thru the quiz. The professor that week had an accent and spoke very fast, and even listening in a slower speed did not seem to help much. The book is a worthy purchase, look for it on EBAY, or Amazon or a Used Book website. The book does go deeper on all topics and again, especially for week 6 and it is looking like possibly week 7 as well are best studied with the book as well as notes provided by the course.Again, this is an overview course, and it is interesting. If you are looking to study specific philosophers in depth - this is not the course. It is the course however to take before taking others or to review or learn what is going on in the area this area of study and it did hold my interest.As others have commented the final week touches upon time travel and the professor has introduced interesting aspects that involve the philosophical in this unit.Each week a different instructor presents information so you are switching learning styles weekly which is, I think made a more smooth transition if you actually have the book and the chapter that the instructor wrote.I would recommend it for at least another 6 mo to a year - after that (say 2017 perhaps the lectures should be freshened up, as new information may be out there, or at least they should tape something that says, ""yes this was originally taped in 2013, however the info is still on target"" or if not then add a lecture that updates the course to the latest in that area of philosophy.Overall, this being my second Coursera class I have found it to be of high quality, and worthy of my investment to obtain the certificate that is offered. And I do thank all of the professors who participated in this collaboration, it is again, a very interesting course that I think is a ""must take"" course if one is to really understand what is ""going on"" with Philosophy.",5
88939,"Very interesting class with very competence professional!Was a honor learn introduction to Philosophy offer by the university of Edinburg, see u guys in next courses!Edvim Borges",5
88940,A good intro course to rewind an old knowledge or tu star up in this path of tought.,4
88941,"I've enjoyed a lot most of the lectures and the activity in the discussion forums is very interesting! I like how professors have directed this course and how it allows everyone, whatever his background is (my field is biomedical sciences), to learn about these themes. I'd definitely recommend it!",4
88942,Very interesting but the video ended abruptly when I was expecting a question. There appears to be no link to the next part of the course. I would have found a facility to rewind helpful.,4
88943,Love this course :),5
88944,Great presentation of the history of philosophical thinking with a focus on how to find your way through competing and contradictory arguments.,5
88945,Great curse! G through major philosophical issues.,5
88946,Very interesting course with different approaches and topics on philosphy. Nice way to refresh knowledge or to get a new ones. Everything is really understandable with good videos and course materials provided.,5
88947,During lessons you don`t receive enough information to be able to pass the exams,1
88948,Thank you!,5
88949,Sorry but he puts me to sleep. No emotion.,2
88950,Great course,5
88951,Easy to follow along and explains Philosophy in simple terms.,5
88952,"It's a great introduction to the variety of philosophical topics, being introductory it just scratches the surface though. Could be made more interesting, but nonetheless a good course to get started with philosophy.",4
88953,"The classes were pretty good, but the bibliography was not. The bibliography consists of encyclopedia's articles which are not necessarily written to a beginner. It is quite discouraging for someone starting with philosophy to read articles which lacks a pedagogic approach.",3
88954,Excellent introduction to the subject from a great cast of different and interesting characters. Subject covered to a depth that was accessible enough to a novice yet deep enough to be interesting and valuable.,5
88955,I really like this course so far. The Instructors do a great job in explaining the material. I look forward to learning more..,4
88956,"Simply outstanding course, even for students who do not have English as their native language.",5
88957,"So far this course has been very very instrumental in my learning. I still feel it should be divided in shorter videos of max 5 minutes each. that is what makes an online Mooc special i.e classes of hours are not forced into you. In anycase, this course was mostly fit for being a well designed and defined MOOC and worth a take by everyone !!",5
88958,Really clear and functional so far. A+,5
88959,Brilliant course to get you a head start on 'Philosophy.',4
88960,interesting， I‘d like to learn more about philosophy,5
88961,Excellent introduction to some of the topics in philosophy.,5
88962,Interesting topics and great lecturers.,5
88963,it was really nice to know somethings about philosophy specially in a simple way,4
88964,"I love the way this course let you embrace the basics notions of philosophy.The only bad thing it's that I haven't found a course like this (That talks of philosophy) in this site, so I think Coursera need more of this courses.",5
88965,'Introduction to Philosophy' is very insightful. The fundamentals of philosophy is explained in a way which is so easy to understand. Very good program.,4
88966,Almost totally ignores the ancients. A skewed view of philosophy from an enlightenment perspective.,2
88967,It was very informative and interesting. Provided some very intriguing questions for reflective thinking.,5
88968,It will be useful to add onthology and metaphysics themes.,5
88969,amazingly concise and well picked topics!,5
88970,Great introduction to the way of doing philosphy. Highly recommended!,5
88971,"Classes were interesting apart from a bit of pronunciation problem to understand the professors, I guess the course was informative and lays down a foundation for thinking about the wider problems around.",4
88972,Thank you for a thoughtful and extremely well presented and absorbing introduction to philosophy.,5
88973,"This was a most interesting short course which I found most useful as a ""taster"" to help me understand what philosophy was about. I especially liked the fact that we had a specialist tutor for each subject.",5
88974,"The course is great. The informatiion is objective, easy to process and good, the only bad thing about this course is that even though it has spanish subtitles all the test are in english which makes them way to hard to resolve. If you give the option of spanish subtitles on an english curse at least translate the test too.",4
88975,Great introduction to a wide range of ideas and intellectual endeavours in the field of philosophy.,5
88976,Excellent course for begginers in philosophy. Enjoyed all the lecturers a lot.,5
88977,"Was a great experience, I learned more about Philosophy and I developed more knowledge, Thanks!",5
88978,"I am studying Philosophy at university next year and wanted to have a idea as to what it would be like. This course was perfect and gave me a taster of the vast number of fields included in Philosophy. It was interesting and challenging I would definitely suggest it to anyone, the course really gives you some things to think about!",5
88979,"Very interesting ... from the beginning, the teacher shows the pupils, to open mind and think better",4
88980,"An exciting and worthwhile introduction to the philosophical fundamentals! While there was not as much focus on the major philosophers themselves as I was expecting, I gained a lot from this course and would recommend it to anyone interested in learning more about philosophy.",4
88981,This Course really thought me how to expand my perspective on everything.,5
88982,"One of the best course i have ever made in this plataform, Greatest professors and really interesting topics. Thank you",5
88983,Very enjoyable introduction to the mesmerizing world of Philosophy... T,5
88984,the course content was very much good and it was very useful.,5
88985,Good to follow by the subs,3
88986,"Very good course, the classes were very elusive and the teacher is amazing.",5
88987,I learnt a lot and it was really fun,5
88988,An excellent course that makes you ask and answer really important questions about life.,5
88989,A smooth and engaging initiation into philosophical thinking with a practical path amid this world filled with so many semantics and distorting propaganda.,5
88990,"I thoroughly enjoyed taking part in this course. The modules covered a multitude of diverse branches of philosophy which helped me to broaden my knowledge of the subject overall and the lecturers were incredibly helpful in explaining simply, and with useful examples, new information. The course has further deepened my love for the subject and the platforms of assessment were challenging, but did not feel labourly. I would without a doubt recommend anybody, regardless of former experience of the subject, to partake in this course and I am highly glad to have had the experience.",5
88991,Very well organized course. If you are looking for a way to get into philosophy this is definetly one of the best options.,4
88992,Good variety and challenging but achievable. Thanks.,5
88993,Excellent course. Well paced and very well explained. All the teachers have the ability to explain complex things in a simple way that is easy for a philosophy beginner to understand. Highly recommended.,5
88994,"Very good course, Offers insights from various domains of Philosophy, which one doesn't go in usually. And ends up discovering that there are in fact various ways to look at this subject which is an essential tool for living and constant improving our quality of life.The University of Edinburgh has structured this course well, and the faculties, bright and deep in their domains makes you understand the contents more easily then they are.Thank you.",5
88995,"Excellent course. It gives in a very pleasant, well presented and clear way 7 essential topics of Philosophy which can be the base for further exploration.",5
88996,"I really enjoyed this course because contents were very interesting and contemporaneous. Reading about travelling time was a real pleasure. Teachers nice, quizzes and texts supported well my development. Congratulations.",5
88997,It is a good course with great content. The professors are well prepared and share their knowledge in an easy way so that everyone can understand their explanations.,5
88998,"Time of my life, thanks for the experience and everything",5
88999,I was very impressed by how the subject was broken down into digestible bits. Well done.,4
89000,Very well done for anyone passionate about learning.,5
89001,"After years of technical readings, this course was a breath of fresh air for me.I absolutely loved all the subjects that this course offered!",5
89002,Great course!,5
89003,"While the indidivual lectureres did have a breadth of knowledge, a manditory discusion should be held with the homeworks instead of just the quizzes for completion. Perhaps a page on each week should be good enough. Just to understand each lecturer's main points.",5
89004,"Very good teaching strategy. Takes you through ideas and gives you examples. Has a couple of questions each video to keep your attention. It is a very interesting subject, even if the teaching was bad, but the lectures add even more by taking their time with concepts. Keep doing what you're doing. I would take other courses by this school if they were similarly designed. Thank you.",5
89005,"Great course touching on very interesting philosophical topics and arguments around them.Not all classes have the same level of clarity, and some of them brush past certain topics a bit too fast, but overall it's a great experience and totally worth one's time.Recommended to anyone who wants to think more about the way we think, and the world we live in.",4
89006,great information on Philosophy,5
89007,Very good course!,5
89008,Fantastic introductory course to Philosophy. It really expands your thinking and methodologies relating to wisdom and knowledge. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Thank you.,5
89009,"Lots of interesting ideas, most presented very well. Hit-and-miss for some of the topics, but usually spot on. Recommended",4
89010,"This course has taught me much in so little time, i'm truly looking forward to completing the entire course.",5
89011,An updated perspective of the main topics of Philosophy. Rich enough to understand it.,5
89012,It's very interesting course. I'll recommende,5
89013,This course give us a basic and broad perspective about the current philosophical problems.,5
89014,Great explanations that is broken down with examples for understanding. Quizzes test for your understanding of the topic rather than just the textbook explanations. Challenging and thought revoking.,5
89015,Great course. Thanks a lot,5
89016,Very good introductory course. Provides an overview of the different philosophical topics ranging from knowledge to time travel.,5
89017,You do not know what you are getting into until you take the first class. What happen to the delete button on the class.l,1
89018,An fantastic introduction to philosophy!,5
89019,"Is for me the greatest course of philosophy I ever had, specially because of a really bad ""teacher"" that I just don't know how can he be teaching, but well, had been my first experience with a MOOC and couldn't be better I suppose. Greetings!",5
89020,Great job on this course!!. It honestly stretched my critical thinking and even frustrated me greatly. Glad to pass this !!! Highly recommended for critical thinkers !!,4
89021,Two weeks until now and I can wait to see all topics left to discuss and learn.,5
89022,Such a eye-opener. Philosophy was a hobby until I ran into this course. It structure my thinking. It made me realize the schools of thought that have tackled the questions I've dived into are as many angles to view a given issue.,5
89023,Excellent instructors and interesting materials make this a delight!,5
89024,"When I enrolled for this course, I was really just looking for a definition for the word 'philosophy'. Boy did I get more than what I bargained for!Instead of going down the usual historical path and looking at the philosophers in just chronological order, the lecturers at the University of Edinburgh have divided the topic into broad strokes, covering the big ideas (and their related writers) that have driven philosophical debate till today. They made sure every topic linked up, so we could understand materialism as the opposite of dualism, rather than in isolation from other avenues of thought. If I want to, I could definitely take my studies in philosophy much further, knowing now where to look!My only minor gripe would be the strong focus on Western philosophers and little mention of other cultural views, however, it would be unrealistic to ask for short online lectures to cover all of human thought endeavours. Hopefully other courses exist so all students can take a global approach to philosophy!",5
89025,"I loved it. It blew up my mind more than once; plus, the teacher of the last week is really cool.",5
89026,"Clear, well-paced and engaging classes. I appreciated the overview of key debates in each topic, and my experience with this course was made all the more enjoyable through the passion with which the lecturers spoke about their respective areas of interest.",5
89027,"This was a very interesting course. Not what I was expecting when I enrolled, but I enjoyed it completely. I especially liked the lesson on the logical possibility of time travel. This was my first Coursera course but I hope to find more courses.",5
89028,I enjoyed this course immensely. I wanted to gain a general idea of what the science or belief behind Philosophy was. This course gave me just that. A good over view of the subjects and the ideas behind it.,4
89029,Highly rated course.For all people who think it is important to understand Life and for it to learn from nicer teachers and great philosophy trends. Thank you to Coursera and Edimburgh University.,5
89030,very well explained.... I regret to haven't follow philosophy course in high school in france now!,5
89031,Nice teachers!!!!,4
89032,The certificate is paid. It should offer a free version of some kind.,4
89033,Quite challenging but workable.,5
89034,An excellent though-provoking introduction to several branches of Philosophy. You can tell the instructors love what they do - it makes it easy to love it too.,5
89035,"Thanks, is a excelent course",4
89036,"I am learning a lot in the course and it's kind of interesting seeing the logic behind how we think, what we think, and how we perceive others.",5
89037,"A basic teaching of Philosophy. The idea of having specialists lecture in thei indivvidual concepts was a direct enhancement in the themes presented. I consider that the course will be repeated ,for several years.",5
89038,"a lovely introduction class. touches some of the most important philosophical fields and multiple approaches to said fields. if you are into philosophy in a beginner level, you should check this out (for the fancy steampunk clothes in week7 if nothing else)",4
89039,So clear and objective. Love it.,5
89040,Very good course with interesting cases and different theories. And also a very good opportunity to think and learn the way of thinking.,5
89041,This is course is actually informational and interesting...Thnak you,4
89042,"Really enjoyed the methodology and the subjects. For me that didn't know anything about the topic, it opened up a whole new world.",5
89043,a nice start for philosophy!,5
89044,"It was very confusing some of the things for me, but I guess is just some topics are hard to understand thank you for this experience i learned a lot !",5
89045,"Great tasters to the field, would also be very interested in an overall schema of Philosophy and its various branches and maybe even supported by a major highlevel roadmap of key philosophers and major arguments as an overall introduction to the field for the novice (like me!), that is considering further study. Might be an opportunity as have not been able to find one as yet on the web .. ?",4
89046,"Excellent introduction to an incredibly broad field. I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in, or vaguely familiar with philosophy. I would also recommend this course to people wanting to brush up on a few things, as it goes over matters at a reasonable pace and thus allows one to get into the themes. Lastly, I would like to say that it's great to see such a new topic (relative to most of the classical philosophical themes) as Testimony in an introduction course. It arguably belongs in the (somewhat) new sub field of Social Epistemology and new research in this area allows philosophers to see original contributions from Reid, Hume and others in a new and modern light.",5
89047,The course does not have much videos and some of the lecturers (especailly week 5) talk TOO FAST. The subject is abstract and hard enough and talking too fast makes it harder.,3
89048,"The course is interesting and its staff makes a great team, but I think as an introduction course, it should focus on the History of Philosophy, without entering into very specific fields of Modern Philosophy. The fundamental notions of Philosophy should be available for learners, as well as the great Philosophers from Ancient Greece to the Twentieth Century.",3
89049,"amazing course,professional but funny .",5
89050,"This course is off the hook! (Literally). And my dear prospective student, all I advise you to do is to sit down and carefully listen to and digest all the thoughts and arguments the tutors will put forward. This is NOT for the sake of agreeing with all they say, but for AN EXPOSURE TO A PLETHORA OF IDEAS. Enjoy!",5
89051,A real philosophy course in the sense that it prompts you to do philosophy (along with the help of the history of philosophy) rather then just teaching you the history of philosophy.,5
89052,"Amazing introduction to the basics of philosophy - I wish I had such in university or at some other early point. It shows you breadth, scope and problems philosophy deals with. Course tries to maintain simplicity and clarity of explanations even for very complex things and this is exactly what you need for a subject which is normally deemed too complex for beginners or gives an explanations which for uninitiated do not add clarity and rather raise even more questions.Loads of fun and topics which may make you think more and induce your curiosity.",5
89053,"I thoroughly enjoyed this course and find that it encouragingly sets some directions, and of course, raises my excitement for further study into some of the different fields of philosophy. Thank you.",5
89054,Very thought-provoking. Every teacher gives a comprehensible and approachable lecture about the given topics. The complementary material also helps. Be very contented with all of them. Thank you for all the contribution for making this course possible!,5
89055,"Great material, greta program and greta discussion. I really enjoyed this class and learned a lot. I recommend this to any one who wants to be challenge out of ""confort zone"".",4
89056,"A very good introduction to some of the fundamental and important ideas in philosophy, delivered in an engaging and straightforward fashion. Highly recommended.",4
89057,I thought it was very good and the instructors were excellent.,4
89058,"An excellent introduction to basic philosophy, including current debates in the field. Easy to follow for a novice like me.",5
89059,Very interesting view to basics of Philosophy. Philosophy topics has in my opinion very modern concept. I like the attitude and enthusiasm of lecturers.,5
89060,It is a very wonderful clan of Philosophy,4
89061,"Really informative and interesting course, learnt a lot and enjoyed it",5
89062,It seems I have failed at week three without having to ask for the answers for three questions.,2
89063,Thank you,5
89064,Excellent introduction to the the discipline of philosophy. The professors are experts and very accessible in their presentation of complex ideas. I am very happy to have taken this course.,5
89065,"Course was great. I completed it at my own pace and enjoyed most subjects covered thoroughly. My favourite week was about Metaethics. I enjoyed it greatly and am continuing studying that in my spare time. The one complaint I would have is that I found it difficult to understand the lecturer covering scientific philosophy, as her accent was quite thick.",4
89066,I learnt a lot from this course. This course is designed very easily to understand. Thank you University of Edinburgh.,5
89067,"I found this course immensely mentally stimulating, and tailored well to those of us who are new to philosophy. I found the weeks that covered the philosophy of mind and the philosophy of time-travel to be particularly engaging and mind-expanding for me. I feel like this course has really opened the door to help me further explore in more depth the philosophical ideas that it provided me a guided introduction to. I would love to see other, more specialized philosophy courses offered on Coursera that cover the topics discussed in week 3, week 4, week 5, week 6 and week 7 individually in more depth in separate courses!",5
89068,love the course.,5
89069,"It is a pretty good course in understand the basics of philosophy and get a sense of what philosophy is doing. The reference materials are really great and can help you gain a deeper understanding of course materials. However, the course is more limited to introduction and does not go in-depth.A good course if you want a taste of philosophy.",4
89070,Overall a good and balanced course.,4
89071,I found the course a little hard to follow mainly because the video lectures would not load. I found I spent more time trying to get the course material working than actually absorbing it.I really liked the lectures once they were working though. Its a very nice introduction to a way of thinking and the examples used to argument the theories were very entertaining.,3
89072,"very interesting, much to learn, readily understandable, taught in such manner that a first year undergraduate can absorb, all science students should take this class",5
89073,I love the new way of thinking it introduced. It showed me how people have analyzed seemingly obvious concepts and help me to examine myself in retrospect.,5
89074,"Excellent course, interesting topics, the instructors all teach in a clear but professional way. Thank you Professor Richmond for spending so much time helping us on the discussion boards! In the future, I would love it if there was more recommended reading, and not just strictly related to the topics in the lectures. Thank you very much!",5
89075,It's a great course to start the process of understanding the context on which philosophy as a subject deals with.,4
89076,Good introduction to Philosophy. Course length is appropriate and assignments are at the right level of difficulty.,5
89077,The course content is very superficial. The pass mark is very high for a course I had taken because of a mild interest. You have to get 80% to pass. One unit in particular was very confusing. It took me 7 attempts to pass it as I had no idea what the first question was about and there was no guidance as to what I was doing wrong.,3
89078,A wonderful course that makes you understand what it means to think. Provides you with new perspective altogether of looking at things in the world. I'm absolutely loving the course.,5
89079,This was a great introductory course to Philosophy.,5
89080,The way of presenting topics of philosophy is refreshing and inviting for further reflection. The tests however are focusing on nitty gritty differences or features in the presented videos. Less motivating to submit the tests and invites me to focus only on the preseed video and excellent links to other extra sources.,3
89081,"Good course,i absolutely gained more knowledge about human beliefs and thoughts.Thank you instructors.",5
89082,"I enjoyed this course very much. Like many survey courses that are well-conceived, this one stimulated enthusiasm for learning more about some of the topics. So much so in my case that I have enrolled in another course from the University of Edinburgh relating to philosophy and science. I expect it will be equally thought provoking as its delivery involves some of the same faculty.I believe this course would be improved if there was a mechanism for constructive feedback on missed exam questions that illustrate how the questions at hand are integral and in context to the presentations and supplemental readings (some of which I pursued). Simply referring a student back to the course outline does not assist learning when a student does not understand why a chosen answer is incorrect in context. I realize this is a tall ask for an online course. In my own experience as a university faculty member having developed computer assisted instruction and simulations (physiology and anesthesiology) there is no replacement for contact and conversation with an engaged teacher whose interest lies in helping people learn. That said, I reflect that my constructive comments are made in light of my overall satisfaction that this course has succeeded in stimulating interest in learning more about the interface and complementary nature of science and philosophy.Borrowing a phrase from the course itself, ""well done"".",4
89083,I really love it.,5
89084,Exellent intro. I would welcome a followup,5
89085,"Great course to introduce non-professionals/beginners into major fields or topics of philosophy. Excellent quality of lessons: teachers were always good to understand, even for non-native speakers, and eager to get across main themes to disciples inexperienced in philosophical studies. Only critique: difficulty levels of exams could have been more evenly balanced.I can only recommend this course to anyone interested in the study of philosophy; great job by the University of Edinburgh and its staff for organizing this on Coursera.",5
89086,"I didn't find the overall content of the course very well chosen for an introduction to philosophy - since it covers so little. The title of this course should have been ""An Introduction to Just a Couple of Topics in Philosophy."" And there are so few philosophers covered. However, the biggest problem was instructorAlasdair Richmond, whose response to debate was locking threads down every time his ideological positions were challenged. He showed himself completely inept to have a debate with more than one course participant and chose to censor a variety of viewpoints he dislikes. It was particularly ironic to see an instructor exercise censorship in a Philosophy course - a domain whose objective, after all, is the pursuit of truth as well as to ask and debate the ""why"" of everything! A petty tyrant does not make a good teacher.Should I ever meet anyone interested in studying Philosophy, my first recommendation to them will be stay away from the University of Edinburgh, since there is no respect for debate, freedom of expression, or inquiry there.",1
89087,Well created and gives plenty of food for thought!,4
89088,"A great introduction to many philosophical areas, well planned, well tested and with very good professors. The only downsides were a couple of slightly ambiguous questions (which, having just watched an hour of philosophical teaching one could easily start wondering what they technically meant) and, to utter frustration, lack of a statement of accomplishment. Nevertheless, if philosophy is of it's own right your target, it is a course well worth taking.",4
89089,"Sorry, but of no real use except to people totally",2
89090,"It was very fun and educational, some of the people where a little hard to understand but I liked the fun approach to learning and the material covered!",4
89091,The pronunciation of the lectors is more than awful! Their English is quite unsuitable for video lectures! So I quit the course. It is just a torture listening to them!,1
89092,"Interesting course, though It shows me how difficult is for me to understand everything. I was difficult to follow it because the videos were too slow and sometimes I went away. besides I wanted to download the Transcriptions and sometimes it was imposible in the iPad. near the end of the course I found out that I needed to close my session on the iPad to be able to have access to my course with my laptop. It is true that I am learning English an maybe this is a hard course for me.. Or maybe it is because I am not a philosopher even If I love them.",4
89093,Enjoyed the class very much. Just the right amount of challenge!,5
89094,"Great course, amazing staff",5
89095,I am compelled to maintain interest in the lectures and I have so far completed the second week. I think it is a good class and hope that it can only get better.,4
89096,It is interesting. Thank you !,5
89097,"Well. It really covers the basic and foundation of Philosophy. I myself, love quotes about life and all. As such, when it comes deep down to these, I didn't really enjoyed the course as much as I thought I'd. Nevertheless, this is a decent introductory course if you are looking to know a slice of Philosophy. Do take note that a lot of reference with regards to the past philosophers are introduced as well. You are basically fed with all their beliefs. But do take them as a pinch of salt. What matters the most are your thoughts and views. Keep them open!",3
89098,It absolutely help you to think about things on the best way,5
89099,Wonderful journey seeking ultimate truth. Young philosophers are great assets.,4
89100,"Awesome, witty, informative.",5
89101,"I think the selected topic were really interesting ones but since i´m not a scientifical backgrpund it was kind of difficult to follow some of the discussed concepts and ideas. And that was because not always these were explained from the very beginning and a lot of them were only mentioned, as it was supposed that we had to know them previously. Maybe with a little more time for the videos this would have been solved.In any case I really enjoyed it and I think it is important to have the opportunity to watch these courses and come to learn where are the stages of these matter. Thank you for the effort!",4
89102,"It is a very entertaining broad introduction to the topic of philosophy in general. The lecturers are very knowledgeable and are very good teachers. However, I wish there would be a more detailed treatment of the topics in question. I look forward to their future course on Philosophy of Science, as I believe that by focusing on a more narrow topic, they will be able to go a bit more in depth.",3
89103,Well organize course !,5
89104,"Excelent group of teachers that makes things very, very interesting!",5
89105,Very clear and good start.,5
89106,You didn't give me an Honor Code Certificate!,4
89107,"Raise some philosophical questions for brain storming. However, not much direction of exploring further where philosophy should go.",4
89108,"Showed me a different way to see life.Philosophy as a lens to look clearer or cloudier, depends on the angle.",5
89109,Fantastic. Thank you. Funny tennis ball story.,5
89110,"very interesting view of conteporany philosophy, specially the topics about philosophy of mind",5
89111,简直是毫无帮助。作业根本提交不了，无法通过的。It's a waste of time.,1
89112,No instructor participates in discussion. No one ever passes the programming assignment because it won't accept any answer.,1
89113,"bad useless garbage,this is the most bad online course i've take,just waste time",1
89114,"Excellent Introductory course that was comprehensive and engaging. I liked the guest lectures especially the inclusion of MBSR and the interview with Prof Omer. I appreciate the course team not underestimating the students' intelligence even though it its an introductory level course, and delivering the content in a thorough, professional manner. Great course.",5
89115,"The course is interesting, the professors are good, they know how and what they have to explain. But the exercises and tests are really easy and do not require lots of knowledge. In fact, seems more like an explanation than a test. So, if you don't practice by yourself you won't learn a thing. Even though Coursera give you an certificate.I would add more and better practical exercises to make this course better.",3
89116,Good intro to bootstrap,5
89117,Nice one to start with,5
89118,the trainers are professional and teach in a simple word practices are very useful,5
89119,Amazing course.,5
89120,Great Course Ever....,5
89121,"After complete this Course, it;s really helpful for me.",5
89122,"It is really a great course , it did not only give me new skills , but it also changed the way I think about web design.",5
89123,This course gave me the skill needed to create web pages with interaction and handlebars-based as well.It's a great course and a good well to improve everyone skills in web development.,5
89124,"Well taught, well organised and addresses key design principles ... LOVED IT !",5
89125,Having different instructors for different modules is confusing,4
89126,"very good course i have learned a lot about how to make my web content better, and inproved my skills on web design",5
89127,The last homework si quite a difficult spike. Way too complicated for beginners.,1
89128,"I enjoyed the course and succeeded, even though I was a totally beginner in Bootstrap and almost a totally beginner in HTML CSS. I'd like to admit that it is well organised, quite understandable and not really hard. Although you need to know English at the level of intermediate, be patient and have a wish to succeed while learning.",4
89129,I like this course,5
89130,Good course!,5
89131,"Very Nice course good to get a hold of how HTML, CSS and JavaScript works",4
89132,"With much self-initiative and supplementary materials/tutorials found elsewhere on the web , I was able to grasp the concepts of this class. If you are self-driven and intellectually curious, this class is for you. OTOH, If you expect everything spoon-fed to you, then you will not pass. Must have a passion forself-taught learning and finding/reading/grasping content, particularly as concerns javascript. Practiceand repetition are the only way to succeed with javascript.",4
89133,"Informative, interesting, easy. All materials provided",5
89134,I think this one is the best course i have ever learnt on cousera.Thanks to University of London.,5
89135,"The course starts with a short introduction on the topic of usability and user experience. A good idea, but not very well presented.Next is an intro to bootstrap. OK, but not deep enough for a course called ""Responsive Web Design"".The last two weeks cover JavaScript. Or more precisely: they cover a few JavaScript libraries.To sum it up, the course could really use a revision. There are too many mistakes in the examples and sometimes, the instructors look a bit unprepared and confused.",1
89136,Great course. I appreciate sharing your expertise on this subject. I learnt a lot and recommend this course to anyone interested in web development.,5
89137,I recommend this course for those who wants to learn web design.,5
89138,"The name of this course is misleading to me (and if it's misunderstood by one, you can assume there are other people affected as well) - it would be more clear what's expecting you if the course would be called something similar to the last assignment name ""Creating a data-driven website"".The responsive part that I was interested in, was basically done with ""use bootstrap"" - that's pretty poor. Of course the course isn't responsible for this, but an appropriate name would fix that.Throughout the course, the quizzes were entertaining - but the quality of the questions is questionable. Sometimes the answer is obvious because the other answers are ridiculous, sometimes you don't know what to click, even though you just watched the video carefully. Reason for this is that there are questions being asked, which weren't even touched in the lesson.It's basically the same with the last assignment - you can watch and do all the lessons before, you've got no idea how to start and what to do as there's simply no explanation of what affects what - which seems to be extremely important in javascript. Yes, it's often told in an overview-style explanation what a function is doing, but something in depth that tells you how to write working javascript functions is lacking.The quality of the explanations also varied in their quality. Some things that were pretty easy to understand, were explained over 10 very boring minutes, other things that were far more complex and tricky, were handled in half a minute. This made watching the videos frustrating at times. I'm not sure which kind of audience this course is supposed for, but the style varies way too much.Furthermore it's great that coursera is offering an iPad-app, but I'd like to be able to use and do everything that the app is offering me (and in the best case: everything that's necessary for the course). I can't even review classmates, as they're uploading .rar or .zip-files, which can't be accessed via iPad, and also javascript is a problem for ipads. Unpacking such files and running them on your servers would be an option, maybe.",2
89139,Good course!,5
89140,Awesome course.,5
89141,"Great introduction to UX principles, responsive design, and client-side templating.",5
89142,Amazing course to get started with data-driven web pages.,5
89143,Very Good!,5
89144,The best on Cooursera.com,5
89145,"I thought this course was great in the information it provided, though it moved a little fast for me as a beginning programmer. I think it would be useful to add a separate course just on Javascript to the specialization, as I still feel pretty lost with JS and the introduction of JQuery and Meteor on a shaky JS foundation is quite hard to grasp without a lot of supplemental information from other sites.",4
89146,"Awesome, easy to follow, web development course!",5
89147,"Good, fun to learn and well designed course.",5
89148,It was good and I learned a lot!,4
89149,"Although the whole UX-UI stuff doesn't interest me much, the professors definitely had me hooked to the lessons.",5
89150,Liked it a lot! Well presented and paced nicely.,5
89151,Very interesting topics.,4
89152,better than my community college course- and free!,5
89153,Excellent introduction to Responsive Web Design,5
89154,Amazing course.Helped a lot!,4
89155,"I think this was a great introductory course, a short summary of various techniques one can use to make a responsive website.",5
89156,Pretty good course :) love it,5
89157,one of the best hands on learning course,5
89158,Interesting and well-balanced course.,5
89159,Very theoretical course they should add some hands on. Its like mugging things for quiz.,2
89160,"If you do not know Bootstrap, JQuery, javascript .... you will get lost after two weeks and from the feedback, it can be clear seen.The course needs to be re-structured.",3
89161,"Great, helped me understand data driven websites and how to use JSON data with a template.",4
89162,The final assignment is challenging. But it would benefit a lot if you work hard to finish it.If there is more detailed instruction for the assignment would help the students finish the assignment.,4
89163,The best course in web design you could find anywhere in the world. Absolutely brilliant.,5
89164,Great course,5
89165,"Thank you for the course!Improvement suggestion: week 3 and 4 lectures are not designed to write little portions of code step by step - only watch and try to remember the whole thing. So when, by the end of the week 4 you need to build the complete gallery - it's quite difficult to remember the whole material. So I suggest to include more interactivity with user during weeks 3 and 4.",5
89166,A course that really helped me to understand how to build my own responsive web page ! Thanks for sharing your knowledge with all of us! Keep up the good work!,5
89167,It's very useful and interesting. Lestures are great!,5
89168,"Great course! I love the instructors, they go at just the right pace and the content was rather fun. Highly recommended.",5
89169,Very Excelent Course,5
89170,"Sometimes not all aspects were properly explained, but I liked the course overall. Would definitely recommend.",4
89171,"It's a great course, i recommend it, good to start in responsive design",5
89172,"It is better than the previous course, but there were problems with the last assignment in which a lot of students could not acces to the details of the last assignment and the problem was not solved by the staff of the course. It was a fellow student who did a copy of the details of the assignment and let the others courserians the possibility to submit the assignment. For this reason i gave 4 stars.",4
89173,Great :) love it,5
89174,It was a great experience.,5
89175,Great course too!!!!,5
89176,Great !,5
89177,"This is great, professors are awesome and quality of material is great. I loved it and I highly recommend this course!",5
89178,I learned a lot and I felt the teachers were interesting and the tasks useful.,5
89179,"I enjoyed this course, but I was lost by the end. I understood the concepts presented in the videos (and got a high grade in the end), but the JavaScript needed for the last assignment was way over my head. I wish there had been more practice with actually using JavaScript; as it is I think I'll need to take another course or do independent study to learn what I should have learned to complete the last assignment.",3
89180,"Great course. I learned a lot of valuable information I can use in my work. The course is not for the beginner. Best if you already have exposure/experience with HTML,CSS, and javascript. Still then you'll need to do your own on-line research. 5 Stars +",5
89181,This is a great second course in web design!,5
89182,Thanks Dr Matthew you're the bestMr Marco I didn't understand anything from you and I stopped the course because I dropped this module because of you. I'm sorry,1
89183,Great intro to web developing.,4
89184,"Nice course, well structured and whit a challenging final test even if it not so easy this time, for a person like me, whithout precedent programming skills.",5
89185,"I enjoyed this course, and found it very helpful in giving me a modern view of web design.",5
89186,"The grading criteria for the assignments were not quite strict enough in my opinion; it seemed like people had the option of creating relatively lame pure HTML websites that still more than met the minimum passing requirements for some of the more advanced assignments. I.e., Bootstrap or Handlebars should be a requirement to pass an assignment about Bootstrap or Handlebars.",4
89187,really helpful,5
89188,"Pretty good course. I'm new to this subject, but I lear a lot from the first week. Thanks",5
89189,"BAsic but excelent. In fact, facilitators encourage us to investigate more, and not only to follow them. So we learn a lot practicing any concept they tought us",5
89190,very nice course.,5
89191,Its nice .But i don't have time for Assignment work .i feel good on templates.,4
89192,"Great experience!! Quirky instructor, and he walked thru all the examples",5
89193,Easy but still very helpful. Good for beginners.,5
89194,"Great content, I enjoy it !",5
89195,Fantastic class!,5
89196,It's amazing course for beginners,5
89197,Complete step by step solution to build a full featured website. loved it. Thanks to all the professors :),5
89198,Great content,4
89199,thank for the couser... lets start the course 3 of the specialization,5
89200,I am learning so many cools things on this course! Love it!,5
89201,"Nice but lacking. Would like it to cover more content, specially around handlebars.",3
89202,The professors need to go into more detail with JavaScript. Our assignment required the use of JavaScript but it didn't fully explain how to use the code that was shared during our class. I enjoyed the class very much and I loved the challenge of figuring out how to complete the assignments. The best part of the assignments consisted of being able to view classmates submissions and learn from them by reviewing the code techniques that they used.,3
89203,"Great course, I've learned a lot. I went from knowing little to know a lot!!. However the time I spent in the assignments is not exactly what was expected, I took probably 10 times more tan the expected time since the level of the last two weeks gets really high and lots of info is missing in order to complete assignments. Hope you improve this next time.",4
89204,Really helpful and improved my skills . ..,5
89205,This course goes straightforward to what matters.,5
89206,Quite easy but I learned a few things.,3
89207,thanks guys.,3
89208,Not as challenging as I would have expected but learning Bootstrap made this course worth 5-stars.,5
89209,Perfect,5
89210,"You will really learn responsive web design.Great courses, great professors, great assignments.",5
89211,this a very brife interested course to begin your responsive design .,4
89212,I thing it is necessary more information about handlebars.,4
89213,Really great course! I recomend it for people who really want to understand basics from web dev and javascript.,5
89214,Learned something new in this course. I appreciate that.,4
89215,The course is useful. I've learned many things but in the last week the lectures seemed very rushed. There was many coding that was poorly explained or not explained at all. It started good but ended poorly.,3
89216,"A course that picks up well from the previous one in the specialization. Difficulty level increases marginally, yet remains perfectly accessible for beginners and intermediate learners.You will need to invest more time towards the last 2 weeks of the course as compared to the initial 2 weeks.",5
89217,"I have learn a lot, definitely worthed mine time.",5
89218,Great course!However some lectures were reused from another specialization and they didnt fit well on this version,4
89219,Great course - learned a lot. Very useful and relevant information.,4
89220,I gave four stars for the previews course of the specialization but I have to tell that week 2 and 3 of this course are outstanding. Teachers are really putting students in the right direction.,5
89221,"Great Course, Absolute for beginners.",5
89222,Nice and challenging course(mostly starting from js part) Like it very much thk you for possibility to learn this topics,5
89223,"Very nice course with solid foundation and great examples. One recommendation would be to split the material on Week 4 into 2 weeks: Week 4 and Week 5. The teachers would have more time for explaining every bit in the lectures so the difficulty would step up evenly between weeks. Other than the amount of material on last week, it is a good course and highly recommended!",4
89224,"It's really cool course for beginners!My little advice: Why lector's don't use the possibilities of Sublime? Sometimes it is so tired to see what the lector go by long way. Check this out, please http://sublime-text-unofficial-documentation.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/keyboard_shortcuts_win.html",4
89225,Information provided are good. All in this course is about theoretic knowledge. One who completes the course has to remember each points when designing a website and also implementing. Further improvements required in this course to make sure more knowledge when taking this course.,3
89226,great course. Teach you step by step with not only skill but also concept.,5
89227,Good learning course,4
89228,I learned a lot from this course - From the html up to the javascript and jquery with bootstrap. Good work.,5
89229,A very detailed course taught by instructors who make it seem so easy. Loads of information even for the experienced professionals.,5
89230,"Great course, thanks. Very interesting content.",5
89231,Great way to start developing fast and in a responsive way !,5
89232,"I did learn some new things, but there were times that I wasn't sure about the focus of the course:some of the questions are on the spectrum of too tricky-unclear, there were too many ""find my error in the code"" issues.Plus, the last project (gallery) - which has many good features and ideas, does not seem completely finished from a UX point of view.",3
89233,"Great course, very clear and good structered.",5
89234,"Continue, Bootstrap is exciting!",5
89235,"Great course, packed a lot into a short time frame.",5
89236,very helpfull,5
89237,Videos mostly show lecturers talking to camera.,2
89238,"Excelent Course. All is easy, understandable. Thanks a lot!",5
89239,Amazing course ...,4
89240,"Excellent course. You will learn jQuery, Bootstrap and Handlebars to improve and create great web sites.",5
89241,Exciting and useful :),5
89242,Teach easy way to do complex things.,5
89243,"Practice makes perfect! This course built on knowledge from the previous course, and solidified my understanding of the subject matter. The instructors are great, and the practice quizzes and peer reviewed assignments really help.",5
89244,Enjoyed this course!Seemed fast-paced at the end but overall the best course so far i have ever took.,5
89245,awesome course!!!,5
89246,"Nice course, very good explanations.",4
89247,Great course and professors.,5
89248,A lot of things to learn... very comprehensive view,5
89249,Very well paced course. Assignments are related to course material and are very good are cementing course topics. Very good course.,5
89250,Im so happy to find out this course. It so useful and i am glad to be part of it.,5
89251,Very interesting course. Good relevant topics are explained (such as using Templates and javascript in order to make webcontent with dinamic data). Very useful course for those who would like to learn the basis of website development.,5
89252,"it was a good Course and i learnt a lot of information from it , it gives you info about a lot of things that hard to find any where else",4
89253,"Very informative course, which gave me opportunity to fell developer myself the most valuable information i got is templates!!!",5
89254,"The whole course is about how to use data to create a web app.After studying this course,i hava got a new skill.Such a wonderful course!",5
89255,Great course!,5
89256,A very complete course.,5
89257,One of the best courses,5
89258,difficult at times - particularly wrestling with Handlebars the template library- but well worth the time devoted to understanding and using what is taught here.,5
89259,Great course. Excellent combination of a theory and a practice.,5
89260,"Very well thought out, structured and presented course.",5
89261,Explanation is Lovely........Really Good :-),5
89262,Always a pleasure watching these videos. The material is well worth the cost.,5
89263,For my first week I'm enjoying the simplicity to teach us how to build a good website...,5
89264,"Great teacher, interesting lectures!",5
89265,"Basic course, great for starters, I need something else",5
89266,It was a bit hard to follow the instructions.,3
89267,easily to understand,5
89268,"The pace increased, as well as the demand.",4
89269,Thank you for an excellent course!,5
89270,"I like how this specialisation evolves... as in the previous block, it does not give you all details, but merely sets the direction. The homework assignments are quite good and, if executed properly, will teach you a lot.The only complaint - frequent ambiguity of multiple choice quiz questions.",4
89271,good approach for beginners,4
89272,Thanks to all lecturers for this amazing course! now I can really understand how to programming. And I want to know more and more. Thank you all!!!,5
89273,Awesome course and was a very good starter for RWD and Bootstrap ( also templating using Handlebars) :) fantastic Univ. Of London...,5
89274,"The course covered a lot of amazing things, but perhaps was too much too fast. I'm definitely not ready to move on to other things.",4
89275,Great value course for my profession..!,5
89276,"I've learned a lot of things in this course and I strongly recommend you to enroll this wonderful course immediately. In this course, you can learn bootstrap, Handlebars, Javascript and jQuery.",5
89277,"Great staff, course was interesting the whole way and they had a different approach than usual.",5
89278,"Simply great, I've learned Handlebars, a great tool to make my life easier programming instead of the use of jQuery all the time to fill DOM elements. It remains a little less difficult and probably a little more extension to cover all the details for beginner programmers people.",4
89279,"This course builds on the first one and allowed me to build a complex interactive web application. The last week was quite challenging but the examples were quite sufficient if one makes sure to rewrite all of the code and understand it, especially if you're new to web dev like me! The instructors are amazing communicators.Regards,Adnan ZuberiToronto, Canada",5
89280,"Very good specialization and very good course, the instructors show the material in a easy way making a good course for someone with a little knowledge about how to make a website and programming language",5
89281,Brilliant - would be even better if the grading can somehow be automated in addition to peer review. This way lazy submitters who finish before course completion can also get a grade.,5
89282,"Information is provided in clear form, lecture are easy to follow. Would like to learn more information about events (had some problem with assignment) and have more freedom on last assignment (another database, purpose of the website)",4
89283,"It's a good course.If I must complain about something is that, since the course covers a little too much too fast, the people that is not familiar with the subject might not understand the why or how of things explained.",4
89284,very nice course,5
89285,"Great work with building up the course, especially starting with the core concepts and then progressing gradually into practical implementation.I especially liked the introduction to handlebars. I was not expecting it in this course.",5
89286,"This is a great course to get to know how to build responsive websites. However, I think some basics were glossed over.",4
89287,"Stuff is explained thoroughly, all documents are provided, teaching staff answers the questions in discussions.I've learnt a lot! Thanks to teachers!",5
89288,"Great course, nice instructors ;)",4
89289,Nice continuation of the spezialization course ^^,5
89290,Excellent Course Designing and professional teaching style.....After completing this course I fee more confidence and experience.,5
89291,"Pace and content of the course is just nice. However, it would be good if more lecture slides were provided.",4
89292,"Wasn't much of a class about responsive design, only one of the four weeks talked about responsive web design. Much of the class was about parts of building sites that aren't relevant to building a responsive site. The week that discussed responsive design just talked about using bootstrap",2
89293,"The course is easy to follow. You could start virtually with no JavaScript experience and end with ability to build responsive JavaScript application. Information across modules is organized in a way that stimulates creativity - learner is not flooded with information about each and every aspect of the framework, while still given all the necessary tools to create rich application..",5
89294,Excelent course! What I learned will be very useful.,5
89295,Good introduction. Easy to follow.,4
89296,"Outstanding class, great approach to covering the topics. Maybe a bit more time on the new method of doing the slideshow though? It's a bit overly complex.",5
89297,"really great course, very helpful. Very pleasant tutors.",5
89298,Great learning experience,5
89299,Dr Mick Grierson the best teacher in this course!,4
89300,"Great format, simple, easy to understand lectures that get right to the point. This has been immensely useful for me and I am already applying the information to a website I manage. Thank you so much for offering these courses on Coursera!",5
89301,"very useful course, I learn more knowledge of bootstrap and javascript .",5
89302,Very practical.,4
89303,"It is difficult, but it is worth it. Gives more than you expect.",5
89304,"Very good pace and good information. As with any course, the more you do above and beyond what is given as 'assignments' the better you will grasp the information.",5
89305,"An awesome course, teach a comprehensive Bootstrap tutorial.",5
89306,Nice hands-on course,5
89307,Great course !,5
89308,Interesting introduction with a good list of further reading material.,4
89309,Awesome course learned a lot from the videos and quizzes!!!,5
89310,"Great course, excellent brief survey of a number of key issues in philosophy of science. Highly recommended.",5
89311,"The course poorly understands the scientific method, and its main effort is to wield unconvincing critiques of science so as to elevate the status of religion in general and Creationism in particular. The last set of lectures is also just badly executed, a confusing meandering talk that amounts to nothing. The course did have a few bright points, like the second series of lectures explaining varieties of naturalism, but overall the course was just bad. Avoid this course, you can learn much more from other sources.",1
89312,"Very interesting course. I certainly learnt a lot about science and philosophy, especially relating it to religion, and the history behind each domain.",4
89313,"I have always been appreciative of free courses that are provided by universities, but this course is clearly biased. The sophistry present in the final module is particularly dishonest. A university is meant to teach the whole story, and have a truthful account of facts. I am deeply disappointed that so much fallacious content could be distributed to individuals, on the pretext of unbiased learning. This course clearly has an agenda. I hope those who take it think critically about the subject matter and do their best to weed out what is reasonable and what is not.",1
89314,love the course,5
89315,Thank you so mush for providing such an interesting course on philosophy for free! The material was good!,5
89316,That was a very great introductory course on philosophy...,4
89317,"I was a little confused because for having a focus on ""Science and Philosophy"", it seemed to me to mostly talk about science and religion through a philosophical lens. The last module was very scattered and hard to follow. Other than that, very interesting, well-presented material.",3
89318,"This course is clearly signposted as being supported by the Templeton Foundation and it shows. The course is short in terms of length and weak in the terms of developing ideas. The designers do not seem to understand properly what science is and what scientists do. This is particularly evident in the final week, an incoherent ramble. The course strengthens my positive opinions of Feynman's view of the philosophy of science.In general. I enjoy Edinburgh University's Coursera courses, but I shall be wary of any of a similar ilk and certainly won't buy the certificate this time.",1
89319,"Week 1 of the course seemed very interesting. A lot of interesting questions were raised - enough to lead me to view the course in a rather positive light. As I progressed through the course however, I noticed that some rather contentious claims were made to seem to have more credibility than they in fact do. Take for example something that was said in week 4, lesson 3. It was insinuated that Lamarckism plays a significant role in evolutionary biology, something that is widely questioned by eminent specialists in evolutionary biology (for ex. Jerry Coyne).Furthermore, it sometimes seemed that rather than presenting the facts for the learners to judge, the lecturers were presenting their own views (this was especially the case in week 4).This course is being funded by Templeton Foundation, an organization that promotes religious apologetics. It seems that rather than presenting facts as they are, the course is disseminating material deeply influenced by a religious agenda.",3
89320,"I really liked this course. The material was good. the lectures were interesting and enjoyable. I learned a lot from the course. My only disappointment was the brevity. I would have liked to delve deeper into these issues, but it was a good starter course for this subject matter. The quizzes were too easy.",5
89321,Mostly disappointing. I found only one week interesting and non-biased.,2
89322,Enjoyed a lot watching this course. Gives a lot to think about!Thank you so much for providing such an interesting and quality content for free!,5
89323,"Overall, the content was excellent. However, week 4 taught by Professor Conor Cunningham was rambling at best and made very little sense. The readings for week 4 were the only informative part.",4
89324,"Have really enjoyed this course, very informative and fascinating. Opened my mind to many different ideas.",4
89325,"The instructor during the last week was in general not very good, he always strayed from the point making it difficult to keep up. He gave examples that are mostly irrelevant, and he was too theatrical and not straight to the point.",4
89326,Very formative!!!,5
89327,Very interesting course. Help me increase my vocabulary and my power of argumentation.,5
89328,"I think this is an excellent introductory course to the philosophy of science. Even so, I felt something was lacking, maybe a sense of closure or a definite end to the course and indication of a clear path forward for those wanting to learn more about this topic. I would recommend this course in any case, I really enjoyed it.",4
89329,Very good introduction to the popular debate on science and religion.,5
89330,"2 weeks were balanced and thought-provoking and one was silly, but entertaining... therefore three starts with 2 stars taken out for ending a good course with a week of silliness.",3
89331,"Some interesting ideas. Unfortunately some of the presentation was so poor that it was impossible to work out what points, if any, were being presented. And for a course called ""Science and Philosophy"" there was far too much religious and/or anti-science content.",2
89332,"Excellent course and one of the kind. I believe it is essential for any thoughtful person who tends to have holistic view for life matters. Whatever your religious belief or ideology, this course will motivate you to think differently. Do not expect answers, there are a lot of questions and you need to look for answers!",5
89333,It is a poor propaganda for religious. It even claims that creationism should be regarded as a viable alternative to evolution!,1
89334,"I really enjoyed this course and the effort it put forth to open the dialogue of religion, science and philosophy. Thank you for creating a space to openly discuss belief.",5
89335,"great course, great presenters",5
89336,"A great course that make us to think about perceived reality, to think about science and religion importances.",5
89337,Awesome course =),5
89338,Good. i had learn a lot of things in this course. Thank you Coursera for providing this course.,4
89339,"Some of the knowledge is useful in life. But they are not integrated well. They let you feel that they are just knowledge but you can hardly connect them with food, with daily life or with your health. The good knowledge teaching should be like how much calorie we need per day? how much food equal to 1000 calories? What is the good sample for eating or cooking? Knowledge is not only formula. This course is not that interesting. But, thanks for the teacher all the same.",2
89340,"The course gives an general theoretical overview about nutrition, but not goes further into details or practical example.",3
89341,Wonderful! It's a great course!,5
89342,"It's unclear how complex your final project should be, and the elevator pitch and tech demo videos can be a bit daunting. But if you choose a project that's challenging and push through it, you can learn a lot.",4
89343,good learning,5
89344,Great tutorial on development processes.,5
89345,"You will apply your Meteor.js Knowledge doing a nice project, something you love to do, or want to do for helping people.",5
89346,The course was excellent all teachers were excellent specially Dr. Mathew Yee King is my favorite through out this course. Well done London University and well done Coursera.... keep it up like this excellent course.,5
89347,My first ever full stack web development course.. in my life. Hoping to create something very very awesome :D,5
89348,"Much of the syntax is outdated in updated external libraries. Would have been helpful to include Python 3 syntax for all programs. Slides were not translated to English, so external sources were required to understand many of the slides.",2
89349,"Professor talks too fast. Maybe since it is not in English, I feel like that.",4
89350,"Well Done!It was my first mooc in Chinese, content was interesting, and example were useful (I liked the exemples with the dow jones).As I tried to follow using Python 3.6, I had difficulties with GUI compatibility and some evolution in SciPy",4
89351,"- In this course, using python 2.x- The whole course in Chinese, no English subtitles- There are no additional materials or information- There is nothing - only the Chinese",1
89352,"It does not cover the details in some aspects, but overall it is a quite helpful course for Python Beginner.",5
89353,Need English Version Please,1
89354,There is no subtitles in English for the video lectures and the slides are in Chinese.,1
89355,"good, but not enough ..",3
89356,"The course is good, though a glossary of the terms will make it great. The lectures' language is clear and easy to understand",5
89357,"This is a really good course, comprehensive and useful to anyone wanting to know about quant methods. It's pretty tough and you need to study, but if you finish it you'll definitely learn a lot.",4
89358,Great course! I recommend!!!,5
89359,"This course is well taught, easy to follow and very interesting. I recommend this course for anyone who wants to gain a better understanding of research methods and critically reading research.",5
89360,This Course is not really free. You must pay to access quizzes and peer graded assignments.Coursera is really moving downhill quickly in terms of free course offerings. It's such a pity.,1
89361,"Quantitative Methods is a great course to get started with the topic. Since there is a lot of information especially if you don't have previous knowledge about the topics, the course handles it with simple examples that occur. If you are interested in more information there is bonus material provided on the end of each week which is very interesting.",5
89362,"The videos were very clear, concepts were explained in a funny and easy-to-understand way, and Annemarie speaks very clearly. The exams were well-written and easy enough to complete if the course was followed. I learned a lot through this course",5
89363,"I enjoyed the course. First, I liked the instructor very much. Dr Zand Scholten explained everything in a very structured and concrete way. Examples were repetitive, but very understandable. Also some of creative assignments (weeks 3, 5, 7) were quite useful for understanding of course concepts.",5
89364,"The course tackles very poignant and relevant aspects of research, and does so in a captivating and creative way. By the end of this course, you will be an expert on quantitative methods, no joke. No statistics included!",5
89365,The concepts were clearly and cleverly explained. The assignments were relevant and helped to extend my knowledge of course videos. I appreciate the methods used to teach the course and provide evaluation and feedback. There was a lot of work but I learned a lot too!,5
89366,The language used in the courses are very clear. The exercises and assignments helped me a lot to understand the provided material. Thanks!,5
89367,Perfect,5
89368,I highly recommend this course for those who want to brush up on the high-level basics of the quantitative research methods.,5
89369,Very helpful,5
89370,Great course!!!,5
89371,very useful and deep,5
89372,"Useful and helpful course that is taught very well through the online lecture videos. However, think it needs to improve its help and guidance for students. I tried to get hold of the lecture organiser when the objective of the assignment was not clear and there was no-one that I could directly contact to ask a question and I was told on the live chat that my only option was to post my query on the forum - which nobody replied to. I think support should be more readily available from lectures rather than relying on other peers all the time who are sometimes just as confused.",4
89373,It requires commitments. But is a must for any researcher or a data scientist.,5
89374,A difficult course but one that's worth every minute spent on it!,5
89375,I've only just started the statistics course but am enjoying it tremendously.Thank you,5
89376,"Good content, good ideas, great examples. The forums were a little abandoned.",4
89377,Great presentation and the modality of lecture is very appreciable,5
89378,"I was very happy with the course. Good amount of workload, good videos, transcripts available, and the exam at the end of the course was difficult, but doable after some studying.",5
89379,Good course for those desiring to develop conception about research design. Students outside the purview of social sciences can find it a bit difficult.A few more examples in each module could perhaps be of further help. Overall an excellent course.,4
89380,Well-structured course! The contents of the course are beyond my expectations.,5
89381,"very good course, well structured!!",4
89382,"Very good and quality training : videos and material are in a very good quality. Assignments make well practice the acquired knowledge and the final exam reviews all lectures in a very practical way that allowed me to make the infinite connections until the end.The only negatively appreciated aspect is the issue to be graded when you submit your assignment few days later. Also, there is no real mentor from the university. These are very critical points that should really exist in a paid online course.",4
89383,Fairly good. Fundamental knowledge for researcher.,3
89384,Clear information given concisely with helpful assessments.,5
89385,So far so good. Great beginning of a great course.,5
89386,Easy to grasp the concepts to apply when using this approach.I enjoyed every bit of the course,5
89387,"Very challenging, but so much awesome knowledge.",5
89388,"It is a brilliant course explaining each aspect of quantitative research methods. The course covers all the major topics used in Psychological Research. It has helped me to understand and apply variety of concepts like research design, measurement and sampling.",5
89389,"I love how clear the information is, and the instructor's enthusiasm keeps me interested.",5
89390,Great introduction into methodology and statistics in social sciences,5
89391,"This course is very dense. The videos are short and to the point, making it a great overall review of the material, or very easy to review the challenging portions if it's your first time being introduced to it.The explanations are very clear, and assume no previous knowledge or subject-specific vocabulary. The illustrations help a great deal with my ability to stay focused, and the digestibility of the content.",5
89392,"Nice Course, quite some views to digest but good for understanding how social research can/should be done/considered. Repetition required to grasp all these new terms if you are not a social science stu",4
89393,A very good course to open up the understanding of research.,5
89394,"Very good starting course for Research Basics. Especially good for Quanitative research, but most of terminology can be applied to any research as main focus is on Hypo-decuctive research approach, which is basis for all research anyway.",5
89395,"I highly recommend this seriously challenging course. It was difficult, but very effective and stimulating. Thank you for taking your time to create such a wonderful and helpful course on Quantitative methods. I've definitely expanded my horizons with your material :) Good luck, and stay inspired!",5
89396,The lecture content covers the most basic concepts of quantitative research. It would be helpful to you if you have no experience in quantitative research before. But personally I think the lecturer covers too much on history--I had a hard time remembering the names.,4
89397,So far it's been very interesting course.,5
89398,Great course with serious application of the learned material.,5
89399,"Its great. So complete, you really gain an integral knowledge of the topic. I couldn't finish it because of the amount of homework.",4
89400,"Not even through the first week, which I started ahead, and I am feeling very logically enlightened by the material.",5
89401,This was a great class suitable either for beginners in the social sciences or people who need to brush up on some basic concepts and theory. The use of relevant and consistent visual aids added a lot of value to the class.,5
89402,"I really felt this course was well presented and easily accessed for working learners. If you wish to build your skills in this area, this course is a good way to do it. My only hesitation regarding this course pertains to the time and energy spent on historical or largely theoretical constructs, such as what Plato thought or did not think about the nature of reality. To me, this should be an applied learning course given its nature and spending time and energy on this seems an academic exercise of little importance to the ability to understand research.",4
89403,"Of all the lectures i have come across, (along with social psychology course of Wesleyan University), this one stands out, the profound depth and the sheer amount of information packaged, in simple language without simplifying, it's one of the best course i have come across, the instructor is very eloquent and articulate, its stimulating and interesting, i can't ask for more, thank you.P.S. though i listen to all the lectures, making notes - as i'm preparing for my psychology research methodology exam-, i'm a non-active participant.",5
89404,"This was a wonderful course. The assignments were thought provoking, the peer review guidelines clear and precise. Really enjoyed it.",5
89405,"I must admit that the assignments were more demanding than expected but overall this course is fabulous. The videos are extremely well done and Anne-Marie makes complicated points understandable for everyone, with lively and fun examples. Expect to spend some time on the written assignments (several research articles to study) if you want to completely take advantage of the course.",5
89406,I keep coming back whenever a concept in my actual Medical Education Master classes seems vague. Thank you Prof. Scholten,5
89407,Really excellent. Highly recommended,5
89408,interesting and useful content. very vivid videos,5
89409,so educating and fascinating. It has really expanded my intellectual horizons and research venn diagram into more circles.,5
89410,Great course with great content!! I learnt a lot! But it takes much more time than 4-5h a week as is stated at course info.,5
89411,I have really learned and advanced my knowledge in quantitative methods. A big thanks to the course instructors and anyone who contributed to the success of this course. the perspicuous and lucid explanations in the videos lectures were so self explanatory.,5
89412,Great use of examples. I was not thrilled with peer-reviews as some people may give you bad scores with no explanation and/or they may be wrong in their understanding/interpretation of the course material/assignment.,4
89413,Great Teachers and information! I cannot believe I can learn so much from my house.,5
89414,"Good lectures, well-designed videos and tests. However, coordinators are low responsive. No extra reading is provided.",4
89415,it's really good for a student in planning department.,4
89416,It was a challenging course for someone that only knows quantitative research. Definitely took me more time than estimated (or proposed),4
89417,Excellent course! I particularly enjoyed the clarity an concrete examples.,5
89418,Excellent review of important terms and concepts. Used it to get ready to run a huge quasi-experimental project.,5
89419,"Very good, easy to follow. Exams are well designed and offer a good training. Videos can sometimes be a bit boring to watch.",4
89420,Very informative for students new to the subject matter.,5
89421,"This course is very insightful, and a great introduction into Quantitative Methods and questionable research practices! The instructor is very insightful, and communicates the information in a highly digestible manner! Thank you!",5
89422,Couldn´t finish it because assigmnets were not graded.,2
89423,"Very nice and interesting!I learnt a lot. I wish I could make better use of discussion forums. Some questions and few concepts remained unanswered/ not clear, however it was a fantastic experience overall.",4
89424,This tutor is very knowledgeable. I like the way she communicates and connects things. She seems to have very good hold over the topics she deals with.I especially liked the interviewees she brought in to give us an 'expert' or extra perspective on the topics of each week she dealt with. kudos to this professor.,5
89425,Challenging but really fun course. I've learned a lot that will be helpfull for the search of a master's degree.,5
89426,Very well planned and had enough information. I sincerely admire the discipline you tried to bring to the learner.,5
89427,"The course gave a really structured sense of what scientific method is and how scientific research shall be conducted. Assessing how the material is exposed to students - one of best courses here, imho.",5
89428,"very good course, but I never recieved the feedback I needed on the forum",3
89429,"It was a really good course, very easy to understand and was good in keeping the interest up. I would only recommend they offered some, at least optional, exercises to help grasp the content.",5
89430,"Excelent introduction, covers a wide range of subjects",5
89431,Fantastic course! Clearly explained and well animated.,5
89432,"Very comprehensive, well-designed, and well-explained. Highly recommended.",5
89433,I think that this is a very complete and interesting course. It is better than I thought at the begining.,5
89434,"I have done the course but I didn't get my certificate yet for reasons that I don,t know.",1
89435,Abstract when the assignment is related to psychology. Could you give us some not that professional articles?The whole course is not designed in a clear and logic way. Overwhelmed with so many terms without clear explanations.,1
89436,"Good pacing, good explanations, reasonable expectations.",4
89437,"Very well done: a lot of effort put into this course, and it pays off.",5
89438,"When you are late in delivery, they tell you ""everything is fine, do not worry, you have until the last week of the course to complete the activity, get your note and end of the course."" They'll repeat over and over again in every week. My course ended on May 15, but they have not let me present my last activity, May 3 even before the final exam. They have forced me to leave the current session, still unfinished deadlines, missing a single activity after two months of work, and enroll again in the next session, which still nor has begun, delaying all the planning I had made for the entire course and all terms of the following courses.In short, disastrous system to keep deadlines and complete the courses that make it totally useless any planning you have to do to set the course for the months that suit you, which, in my case at least, may at risk which I can complete the full specialization before the deadline. Money thrown away.",1
89439,"Excellent lectures, good tests, too many peer evaluations!",1
89440,"It is an excellent course. The graphics, explanation, and examples are quite exceptional. Congrats",5
89441,I loved working with this course. I am definitely going to graduate school based upon my achievement and enjoyment levels. Having a practical look at my potential new field has made me much more decisive about my path. Thank you!,4
89442,"I have to say thanks to Dr Annemarie Zand Scholten. I can feel how much efforts she had put into the lectures. Complex contents are simplified and easy to learn even for a non-native English speaker like me. I'm happy because I joint this course, very useful, an enjoyable experience.",5
89443,mechanically it worked pretty well. just a little hard to figger out what's going on and what's important. what needs to be memorized and what just needs to be understood . . .,3
89444,There is nothing that i would have like to change about the course. Brilliant work! My sincere thanks to the whole UVA team for this specialization,5
89445,I like to admit that I am a better person and am becoming a better manager in the process of taking this course.,5
89446,"Lots of abstract concepts, really hard to Asian people. And the teacher's talking speed is a little fast. I have to watch the video for more than 4 times to make some sentences clearly.",5
89447,"Excellent organisation of the course! The content is also well thought and presented. i personally clarified many vague questions related to variables, measurements and research ethics. I did have the quantitative methods course at the university, in any case some blank spots were left, so this course was helpful. It is a useful course for revising, but I do not know how total beginners feel about it. If I were a beginner I would have some difficulties probably. It could relate to my personal ""slowness"" to grasp material like this.Thank you Annemarie! I really like your lecturing/teaching style.",5
89448,"This is my first MOOC and I enjoyed it. The lectures were clear, concise, and interesting. Most of the tests and assignments were relevant and well thought out.",4
89449,Well structured course with the best assignments. Would totally recommend for beginners in the Social science research domain.,5
89450,"The course is very good, language very clear, concepts explained very well. Congratulations to the team from Amsterdam University!",5
89451,"This course really helped me to filter out unnecessary and false information and do better quality researches. I always advise this study to people who could merit from it.So far, the best course I have ever done.",5
89452,Excellent material. The weeks on measurement and sampling went a bit too fast but otherwise the course is fantastic.,5
89453,"An excellent course that really does provide you a challenge. Some of the courses I have done on different MOOCs were rather too easy, but this one did push me a lot. It informs you in a clear, but detailed manner. It is necessary to do extra reading and to review videos and notes in order to complete assignments. Best course yet",5
89454,One of the best courses! Good in-lecture questions. :),5
89455,This course provided a great experiece of online study. The high quality content of the videos and adequate rithym of assignments and quizzes are features that make it an admirable course. I strongly reccomend doing this course if you are still in doubt.,5
89456,Over reliance on student grading. Material does not map well to the quizzes.,2
89457,Absolutely necessary for anyone interested in Science!,5
89458,"Good Course. It should be complemented with reading of Neuman, Quantitative and Qualitative Methods in Social Science, which gives a far better overview of the contents of week 1 and 2 (insights into the scientific method). Nevertheless the rest of the weeks are very good and should provide a great framework of Quantitative methods for a undergraduate student, who can then complement this framework with some detailed additional readings, if it is of his liking. All in all, I really ended my fisrt college semester with an excellent knowledge in quantitative methods, for which I have to thank, in part to Miss Scholten for this wonderful course.",4
89459,"excellent course, much bettet that in my university",5
89460,"The material has a very good quality. The teacher explains the subject very well and the videos are very supportive. The build-up in the course is well-thought and works like a charm, I am excited to continue with the specialization.",4
89461,"Simply Amazing! Tough, but really good!",5
89462,I love that the videos have little drawings and notes in them to help the concepts stick! The teaching for this course is exceptional!,5
89463,"This course is excellent! I found the content of very high quality, the lecture videos are very clear and easy to understand. What I find remarkable however, is the quality of the exams and assignments! The staff have put in a lot of effort in creating questions and assignments which really test your understanding and knowledge with a clever marking system which always works out to give you a fair mark even when the assignments are peer reviewed. Well done to Anne-Marie and the other staff who put together this course :)",5
89464,"The course convenor is lively, personable and enthusiastic, which helps keep the learner engaged and interested.All the concepts discussed are exemplified explicitly via simple case studies, so that learners can make sense of new, abstract knowledge.The learning material is broken down into logically sequenced, bite-sized chunks, and there are plenty of concept visualisations - the illustrations are great!Thank you, Annemarie and Team, this is a fantastic course.",5
89465,Brilliant!,5
89466,"I really enjoyed this course overall (and it was somewhat easy for me because I have some background in this already), but there were some technical issues especially regarding accessing assignments. It would be nice if there was a more robust group of volunteer tutors/teaching assistants or something to answer questions or deal with these technical issues, especially the final exam not working for a while for me and some other people. But, I enjoyed the illustrations (drawings) and cute examples, and also the lecturer did a pretty good job on camera. I would probably give this course a 4.5 if possible, but I am hesitant to give it a full 5 points because of the technical issues. Anyway I would recommend the course to someone who wants a survey of quantitative methods to prepare for future study.",4
89467,"What can I say? Although it was a tough course but sometimes things were tough, it felt so incredibly fruitful each week. I think the main reason was because even though there were so many quizzes and the assignments which required so much time, they were carefully crafted in a way which helped build my abilities in a progressive manner. There was definitely a close alignment between instruction (video) and the assessments (quizzes/exams). You'll never be asked questions you weren't prepared to answer because of the aforesaid alignment.As I also work in a department which dabbles in educational research, I found the concepts thought in this course directly applicable to what's done in practice. Because the concepts were communicated so clearly, I could readily see examples of them in my everyday work!",5
89468,Excellent introduction to quantitative Methods!,5
89469,Very introductory course. I learnt a lot from it. Will continue other courses as well.,5
89470,"great course. instructor used simple language, applied concepts and good examples. lecture slides are well prepared.",5
89471,I really enjoyed the course and I learned a great deal. The course design is thoughtful and well-carried-out. The illustrations are delightful! The instructor is obviously expert on the topic as well as in teaching and information is delivered very clearly. I will be building on this new knowledge for some time to come!,5
89472,great teaching on the subject!,5
89473,"An excellent course! Quantitative methods are very well explained, starting from philosophical roots. I liked a lot the challenging tasks and peer review principal. By checking my peers' work I was able to learn several times more than from just going through the videos and completing my own work. I enjoyed the whole design of the course, including the professional illustrations and graphic design work. Great thanks to the whole team!",5
89474,Very helpful courses.,5
89475,Great Place to learn and serve,5
89476,"This is a great course on research design! Especially if you complete all the assignments, there is definitely something you can learn from this course. (I mean, I teach research design and even I learned new things!)",5
89477,Clear and great methodology!,5
89478,Great introduction to the topic.,5
89479,"Funny, useful, clear and serious too. I loved it. Many methodology courses before, but this one addresses also ethics on research practices and History of philosophy of science. simply I adored it and learned a lot. I strongly recommend it. It is so useful for my work and my everyday life. Interviews with real researchers and revising real publications helped me to conect contents with my inmediate reality.. Thanks to all team and congratulations for such a great course.",5
89480,Its a very well structured course which makes this course interesting and easy to grasp and learn.,5
89481,"If you are a senior FBI, choose it. If you are a high-profile CIA, choose it. AHa. I am kidding, even, it's 100% true. However, if you are a social scientist, or if you are just one who is interested in it, choose it.",5
89482,I definitely learned a lot — I liked how there was a quiz and a brief written assignment every week. Good course!,5
89483,Very well organized and executed! The assignments are both challenging and present excellent learning opportunities.,5
89484,Excellent explanation and assessment methods. Dr Scholten is simply great.,5
89485,"Excelent, one of the most good teacher that i ever have. Recomended 100%",5
89486,I am loving this class. The videos are succinct and packed with great information!,5
89487,Really enriching course material and the method of explaining by Annemarie Zand Scholten. It gave me a good overview of the quantitative approach to contrast it with the qualitative approach i have been following at my workplace. The course material is very comprehensive and also the transcripts provided for each module. The detailed word to word transcripts really help to revise material while doing assignments and preparing for exams. The assignments really makes one think and helps to digest the course material in the process. The concepts and style of illustrations used in the video are also extremely helpful to understand the content heavy topic. The bonus video material provide the completeness due to the applied examples discussed in them.Overall a very satisfying learning experience! Great!,5
89488,"A very good teacher and interesting and clear videos. Besides, the tasks have been demanding.",5
89489,"Excellent course. Hard work, but well taught, engaging and I learnt lots.",5
89490,"I was extremely impressed by this course, its pedagogy, its depth and breadth, the clarity of the lectures, the quality of the material. Well done to all involved. I have signed up for the entire specialization and hope that the rest matches up to this.",5
89491,"Clear and concise explanation of very important, even essential, for researcher, things. Warm thank you for creating the course.",5
89492,"I had taken 99% of the course last time, but didn't have time to do the assignments or complete it fully. I was pleased to see it was running again.I've followed many many many Courseras and this is by far the highest quality. Well done!What you did right?Illustrations. They perfectly capture the concept without distracting. They are amusing and just-the-right-degree-of-imperfect, which makes the course material feel approachable.The graphic design. The slightly messy, hand-written, crumpled paper background design is perfect. Not pretentious, not overly boring. Just that little touch of individualism and authenticity we need. This is a great way to avoid alienating your students, to keep a connection.Philosophy of science, history of science, research designs, etc. Despite having studied for a BSc, an MSc, and a scientific postgrad, I had to find out about these concepts through on-line courses and podcasts. I was really happy to see these neatly presented to me in a structured way in one spot in the context of a formalResearch methods course. When covering these sections, you also did a great job at sticking to the important stuff. I am extremely impressed. In the reality of research, we get sucked in by the nitty gritty and forget about the big picture. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful framework behind the scientific method.You actually bothered spell-checking the transcript, particularly for proper names. I've had Courseras where the transcript seemed more like a onomatopeas than serious text.This is all I remember for now, all that's fresh off my mind, as am just up to week 2 right now, but I wanted to give you all a thumbs up for this great course you've wrapped up. I am seriously considering registering for the entire specialisation because of the quality of this course.",5
89493,"Excellent course. Very tidy and high quality of the visual presentations. In addition, its objectives are pretty clear from the beginning and the evaluation tasks are closely related to the course's topics.",5
89494,"This is a course that is well thought out, informative, descriptive, and enjoyable! I was excited to start each new week of Quantitative Methods, and to learn more about research methods! I definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in research, and this will help strengthen your basics in quantitative methods. I commend Prof. Annemarie Zand Scholten, and the rest of the team from UAmsterdam for bringing a wonderful course to the Coursera platform! I can't wait to start & finish the rest!",5
89495,"Fun course, great learning! Impressive and highly recommendable!",5
89496,I have benefited a lot from this course as a pre-cursor to my PhD work. getting to learn from international experts is a greatest benefit of MOOC. thanks to the faculty and coursera to make this available online.,5
89497,"Just three stars so far, I've just started the course late... I think it looks good tho.",3
89498,"I really enjoyed this course. The concepts and expectations were clear, the quizzes had good explanations for the answers, and the illustrations really helped to make each of the topic areas more understandable.",5
89499,Fantastic teacher and excellent coverage of a broad range of materials.,5
89500,Great content and delivered in a clear way.,4
89501,"Excellent course!!!Very well explained, clear examples, good and rich contentThis is a MUST DO one!!!",5
89502,Interesting and concise. Straight to the point.,4
89503,"I found this course very useful, and the videos were really well-made and entertaining despite the dry subject.",5
89504,Simple and inspired me to take another course from Coursera !,5
89505,Very simply understandable course.,5
89506,"Unexpectedly, I am really enjoying this course!The course is very well organized, easy to follow and engaging.Great job!",5
89507,Extremely useful and interesting,5
89508,Excellent course! But I am worried because I have already paid the certificate and I have not received it!,5
89509,I like how the videos were short (about 5 min. each) and carefully scripted. The illustrations/drawings were also very helpful.,5
89510,"Great course, very useful and easy to follow!",5
89511,One of the best online courses I have ever taken. I cannot recommend it enough. Well done!,5
89512,I was very impressed with the perspective the course took. I had not seen the topic covered from the point of view of the harm to society poor methodology had.,5
89513,"The first time I actually finished a coursera course! The course creators have obviously put a lot of time and effort into creating this course. The lectures extremely well done, the material and assignments are challenging but not impossible and the material is presented in such a way that even qualitative researchers like myself (no know for their passion for quantitative research) can get excited about the material!",5
89514,Excellent quality of videos and tasks.,5
89515,interesting and informative course.,3
89516,"The actual educational value of this course is quite high. The score I can offer it in good faith is dragged down by the additional ""assignments"" like ""Write you own quiz question!"" and the expectation to review the quiz questions thought up by other students. Such things in a scientific course are unnecessary and may actually be counterproductive because of the reliance upon other students and their grasp of the material. If they are to remain part of this course, they really should be treated as supplementary and not required to complete the course. It really detracts from the experience for those of us who come here to learn and not to socialize.",3
89517,"Gradually going deeper in the subject. Easily understandable, clear explanations, simple examples, well done illustrative videos. Up to date problems discussed.",5
89518,"Excellent course. Instructive, informative and useful, with the best instructor I have ever had. Best course, by far.",5
89519,"I learned much more in this course than other courses about quantitative methods. It is clear and useful and inspiring. The quizzes are very good, because they are not only about konwledge,but also about whether you can apply the knowledge. And the interviews are very good too, which give us more information in different subjiects, or from different perspectives. But I feel the speaker's speaking speed is a little fast, and I hope that there will be exercise or quizzes in which we are given situation,and asked to come up with RQ, methods, analysis, etc.",5
89520,"Wonderful course, make you think in the proper way to do everything!!!!!",5
89521,I am learning a lot about how I can evoluate a research and how I can clean my experiments in order to achieve the best results,5
89522,Nicely explained with easy to understand examples. Quite hard for those who have never studied research methods. Very dense information. I found one or two questions in the weekly quiz that I couldn`t answer with the knowledge available in the videos.,4
89523,Extremely helpful.,5
89524,Great course,5
89525,I'm in week 2 now and I really like it...its very informative and,5
89526,Thank you for making this course. It exceeds my expectation.,5
89527,I think this course is awesome. I recommend everybody to take it. Professor is excellent. Material is extremely useful. It doesn't matter your background you will find it very interesting. It will help you be a good researcher.,5
89528,"I like the slides, because they are really interesting!",5
89529,"Excellent! The course is extremely well thought over and executed, even in minor aspects of the course, like scripts, additional pieces of information, exams, created just for practice with feedback, great exercises. The content is highly relevant, well structured and illustrated, clearly laid out. The course is very challenging, thought provoking and stimulating, though it is not an easy course.",5
89530,Excellent. Thank you very much,5
89531,Clear video's with good examples. Good structure.,5
89532,"A comprehensive vision of the evolution of photography as a medium, exploring all its different languages, meanings and evolutions through time.",5
89533,"Thank you very much. The course was saturated and I enjoyed the process of studying a lot. I like the sequence of materials, and interview with the photographers. Special thanks for the books, they are really awesome! Wish you all the best. Sincerely yours Alexandra.",5
89534,"I was excited to attend this course, every module introduces new degree of understanding what the photography is and how it circulates, how it affects our life and vice versa how our requirements, social issues, technical progress etc. affect photography.",5
89535,"Great introduction to looking critically at images, challenging myself with questions about images. Course is well presented with an interesting array of artists and interviews.",5

89537,"I Really loved this course,It introduced me new keywords,language,different way to analysed apiece of art and specially New Photographers thatactually i've been at the exhibit while i was Studying it.Highly recommended",5
89538,"This course keeps what the title promises, look through the photographs, is a truly innovative course, once completed the photos will be seen with new eyes. Great!!!!",5
89539,"magnificently detailed course, of great interest, with a vast archive and detailed and specific material for every section, with interesting interviews of experts. the course has widened my horizons and has enriched my knowledge with invaluable help thank to the great work of the curator too, for all this I'm very grateful both to Moma and Coursera",5
89540,"An interesting experience, stimulating and unmissable. I recommend everyone this course.",5
89541,awesome materials,5
89542,"Informative, engaging, high production value. I give it a hell yeah.",5
89543,"I really enjoyed the course, the way it is structured, the clarity of concepts and the agility to go from one topic to another.I learned a lot and I want to enroll in more courses with you.Thank you very much",5
89544,"Thought provoking material, that enlarged by view of the field of photography.",4
89545,Really enlightening have learn so much thanks for making this available.,5
89546,This class was an excellent overview of photography. I also was able to learn about new photographers. I've taken a history of photography course before and other art courses where photography was reviewed so I was happy to see that the course still allowed me to learn something different. I highly recommend this course.,5
89547,Its a great course to get bases in photography.,4
89548,"A complete, inspiring course!",5
89549,"As a photography professional but not a fine art student, I found this course valuable in understanding the evolution of photography from its role in historic image capture to become a form of social observation and artistic interpretation and statement. Understanding the evolution of the photograph has made me more aware of what artists working in the photographic medium are trying to represent through their works.The course is not technical. It does not teach how to compose or develop a photograph. Rather, it is a lesson on the history of photography and using photography creatively through alternative and creative interpretation.",4
89550,Great course! I enjoyed diving into photography with such an important institution as MOMA.,5
89551,"It was such a pleasant journey, thank you so much because I learned a lot and specially I discover a variety of talented photographers that have inspire me even more, This course has aroused my curiosity in to all the different types and possibilities what we can work and explore within. I really like this course and the way it is done. Sorry if I did not participate on the discussions but apart the lack of time as my english is not very good I do not feel very comfortable exposing my ideas on another language.",5
89552,"Glad to have participated in this course. Classy and fun, a very accesible journey through this art. Recommended!",5
89553,Really enjoyed this course's contents! Thanks!,5
89554,Excellent approach to analytical Photography observation. This Course is a pice of Art.,5
89555,"I enrolled the course expecting a little more vision on ""how to read"" a photograph, a composition, although thanks to the Curator I now understood that the context (time, environment, history, …) is important to that purpose.I appreciated the competence with which she treated each subject and the interesting perspective given to the various modules. It gave me a new viewpoint in what photography really is.Good videos and interviews made it easier to understand.Some readings from the required and additional resources were difficult because of the concepts.I personally found some topics (module 5 and 6) a bit abstract and difficult to follow, but I put myself into it to expand my knowledge and open my mind.",4
89556,This course is perfect. I learned a lot and I value all the information obtained. Congratulations on the course.,5
89557,I really enjoyed the Course. It's very well organized and it has a very interesting syllabus. The videos and talks in each module are really interesting and informative. And all the recommended readings wvery helpful.,5
89558,I developed a deeper understanding of the role of photography from this course. From the first lesson I was hooked. It has ample examples of all different types of photography and how they have influence society. I found the interviews with the photographers to be enlightening. Highly recommend this course.,5
89559,The reading material provided on this course for download or to read online is phenomenal. I really appreciated the articles and chapters from books made available. The selection was excellent and was obviously chosen by one of the great experts in the field of photography. The videos made by MOMA are first rate. The photographers selected for study are wide-ranging and well chosen. This is a brilliant course which I am recommending to my camera club here in the UK.,5
89560,abstract and uninformative stories about some photographersbut not about the profession of the photographer or the technical side of the workThank you for the opportunity to get acquainted with the course,2
89561,"This course is fantástic, the approach, the authors and their creations are very interesting. For me, the best important has been the reflexions, about how make the photography, the how, why and in order to that. One experience, that I recommend totally.",5
89562,"A perfect course, for all who wants to know more about photography!!",5
89563,"A very fine course and an interesting and stimulating learning experience. The materials were great - based as they were on the vast archival resources of MOMA's photographic department. These were deployed to provide a quality course. It was particularly interesting to be introduced to photographers and work with which I was previously unfamilar - 'Evidence' and 'Carnival Strippers' in particular spring to mind. My only quibble was with the forums - which were ok, but compared to other coursera courses seemed to lack the engagement of tutors to pose searching questions and provide quality feedback. For some reason the forums were a little flat and didn't appear to stimulate e a high level of engagement . Other than this quibble, though, a hugely enjoyable and worthwhile course. Thank You!",4
89564,This was my first course done through Coursera. The MOMA resources were great and I found the course really well curated allowing me to develop my understanding of photography that much better. The modules moved me from one interesting aspect to another. Reading resources were excellent as well as all the other clips embedded in the program. Opportunity to provide and receive feedback was good and the online platform worked really well.,5
89565,An eye-opening course for anyone who is interested about the development of photography over the years!,5
89566,I enjoyed this course a lot! I learnt about many artists I had not come across before. It was interesting to see photography used in different and novel ways by a variety of artists.,4
89567,"I would give this course 4 1/2 stars. The course material was very well organized and the examples provided were for the most part very topical. the weight of the peer review at the end of the course is too high. Your peers have roughly the same knowledge as you do when you submit your assignment. They are being asked to assign a value to your submission which is really coarse...as there are only 3 choices 1 a pass, 2 not quite and 3 a fail. Considering you have done all the course work and quizzes up to the end it seems quite arbitrary.On another note I would like to suggest a project which became a book. All too often today we view photographs in every moment of our lives but we are unaware of the the face of those creators and their iconic works. MoMA's course seems a perfect opportunity to somehow introduce the subject. the book is Behind Photographs - Archiving Photographic Legends by Tim Mantoani and MarkMurphy.BEHIND PHOTOGRAPHS: ARCHIVING PHOTOGRAPHIC LEGENDS began as the personal quest of photographer Tim Mantoani to document and preserve noted photographers together with their images. ""We have come to a point in history where we are losing both photographic recording mediums and iconic photographers,” Mantoani comments. ""While many people are familiar with iconic photographs, the general public has no idea of who created them. This book became a means to do that, the photographer and their photograph in one image.”",4
89568,This course it is incredible,5
89569,Beautiful works of art!,5
89570,"I found the course interesting, however I had trouble finding all of the written materials to read. Some were available online, but none were in our library system. I think it would be better if more of the reading was available to people. I also thought that the final assignment instructions were a bit confusing. As it is I never did get to upload the photographs for the final prompt. I asked for help on the forum, but no one responded.",3
89571,"EXCELLENT, TOTALLY LOVE IT!",5
89572,One of the best art history courses!,5
89573,"The course provides an in-depth immersion into the worlds of photography. Beyond the genuine interest of the different courses, the learning process itself is well thought with a good gradation and the ability to deep dive into a theme thanks to the complementary material proposed.",4
89574,i enjoyed the interviews -- hearing and seeing many different artists using the same medium in very different ways,3
89575,I loved this course! So inspiring and wonderful. Makes you want to pick up your camera and apply what you have learned. I know the photography class I teach will love looking at the work of the artists featured here.,5
89576,"I really liked it. I knew the world of photography is extense, but i never took the moment to completely learn about it. This course is complete and interesting.",5
89577,The material of this course is of high quality. Well designed and presented. Highly recommended to anyone wishing to gain some basic knowledge on the historically conscious body of the photographic world.,5
89578,Very interesting,5
89579,"Seeing Through Photographs is a fantastic course. It is perfectly guided and contains a lot of interesting, valuable and useful material. I enjoyed it enormously. Totally recommend.",5

89585,Very interesting notions and interviews on American photographers,5
89586,It is a great study program for photography. I want to congratulate the whole staff of MOMA for this complete and marvelous description of the history of this medium along with the current exploration of it.,5
89587,"I really enjoyed the modules in the course, especially the one about documentary photography. I liked how the last module brought in the contemporary world too. Great course, very helpful and educating.",5
89588,The readings are truly intresting and very avant garde. great materials analyzed in a very interesting way!,5
89589,"It was a very interesting experience! Great authors and professors. I learned a lot and I hope this platform will help people to increase their photographic culture, like it did to me!! Enjoy the course!",5
89590,Enjoyed it!,5
89591,"Excelente curso, la diversidad de enfoques y opiniones sobre el arte y la fotografía han sido de gran valía, muchas gracias por el curso, espero tener la oportunidad de estar en otros cursos con ustedesExcellent course, the diversity of approaches and views on art and photography have been very useful, thank you very much for the course, hope to have the opportunity to be in other courses with you",5
89592,Rather interesting. Challenged my perception of what photography is and could be.,4
89593,"A lot of study of artist's work, which makes you study the history of photography as well. The weekly thematics are good.",4
89594,A really amazing course full of excellent resources. Perfect for the inquisitive photographer.,4
89595,"Buen curso, sobre todo los recursos bibliográficos gratuitos.Nice course, the best part was the free library resources.",4
89596,"Nice, but I expected more (or something else).",3
89597,"Amazing work. It makes me more open, and no doubt, better photographer. Thank You!",5
89598,Es una Excelente opcion para formar mejor criterio Fotografico/It is an excellent choice for best photographic Form criterion,5
89599,Learned a lot of about Photography & Art and got direction on what I want to learn further.I wish the videos were longer. Uploaded text was formatted in to be easier to read online. The pages were multiple horizontally and text was small.,4
89600,"I did enjoy these 6 weeks. I found the course very informative.There are a lot of rich content , text, images, video that make the class the more interesting.I really recommend this course.",5
89601,"Excellent course, thoroughly recommended if you're interested in understanding the history of photography as an expressive and artistic medium",5
89602,"Very well done! Compliments to all the staff, my best regards, Dario.",5
89603,It is really good you have interviews with the actual photographers and that they share something about their work :) Learned a lot.,5
89604,"Excellent course! One of the best I have ever taken on photography. It opens up a large variety of topics and plots them along the evolution of photography from its very beginning to today. All of the content was hugely interesting, the materials and required readings were well-chosen and, most important of all, the course opened my eyes to many new possibilities of creative expression. This course is a must for anyone seriously interested in the subject of photography.",5
89605,A great instance to learn and appreciate visual art media through an extensive review of the different approaches of this discipline.,5
89606,Very useful course! I am enjoying it!,5
89607,I'm impressed by the way different photos were included in each module. It shows that the curator does have inspiring advanced skills of observation. And she also prompt us to implement ours throughout the course and on every aspect.,5
89608,the Photography in depth!,5
89609,Great course with helpful resources and suitable for beginners,5
89610,This course is excellent. great learning experience. parabens teachers and help desk support team especially Marie .,5
89611,Great course! Really interesting and well done !,5
89612,It's a very good course. I love photography and learn about this incredible artists was an amazing experience.,5
89613,Phenomenal.,5
89614,"Such a great oportunity to travel through the fantastic history of photography, you will see grat artists and great topics to enlarge you knowledge, Thank you so much Sara, annd the MOMA for giving me the oportunity to learn and enjoy much mor the photo world",5
89615,"Great content, really helpful course.",5
89616,"This is a good course on photography from an important institution that will show you and teach you the several aspects and topics of photography, from document to artwork. Made of six modules, each focused on a specific aspect, it provides different media to learn from, like interviews, critics and overviews, both in video and writings. All aspects are of photography are necessarily condensed and sometimes basic but many different links and suggestion on further material is given for those who want to get deeper. If you like photography, if you want to understand it better, or even if you are just curious about this medium which is today in everybody's lives, you will hardly be disappointed by this course. The only negative aspects for me were that sometimes the material was difficult to read and that sometimes subtitles were not very good, but this latter is a problem only if you are not an English motherlanguage. Instrucions on grading and final assignment aren't so easy and well them and this is a possible improvement for the organisation.",4
89617,Just phenomenal. It's beyond words. A real experiental learning opportunity that riches across history and time.,5
89618,I thoroughly enjoyed this trip through several genres of modern photography.,5
89619,"Absolutely Awesome! It is a time travel reviewing history, psychology and others important factors of the humanity. Really enjoyable and really high quality. Highly impressed.",5
89620,"This is the first online course I have ever done, and I guess I couldn't have chosen better. It's gripping, thoroughly prepared, there is a grand variety of materials that accompany every lesson. I highly recommend it!",5
89621,Excelent! Realy changed the way I understand photography.,5
89622,I loved the class. As a photographer sometimes I tend to be very focus in gear and technology. I loved the artist approach of the class. I learn about great photographers and their influence in society.,5
89623,"In my opinion this course is based in strong concepts and gives a good learning opportunity for those who want to understand the role of photography as a important medium. I have learned very much and, more than that, the course inspired me to keep learning by myself about the subject. I would suggest including other important names of photographers, who were/ or are key people in the history of the medium. In some way, I came out of the corse with the impression that American photography was really the focus. Photographers from other nationalities where in focus when related to US someway. I missed that the course would have a broader vision to offer about photographers that were/are relevant in that medium. Cartier-Bresson and Robert Capa for instance were merely mentioned and Helmut Newton (maybe I missed), I didn't see him mentioned.My other suggestion is related to the quiz. Sometimes, the questions are focusing in aspects not really relevant of the theme of the week. There was a really relevant content and some questions would focus on for example the ""Edson Chagas distribute his work himself or not"" when his work has an important social impact to be called of the attention of the students. In the week 4, the content related to posed/unposed photography for example was not included in the quiz when it was a key part of the message of the week's theme. So, my point is to review the quiz, including content which is relevant and it might be out, and prepare the questions not necessarily focusing in aspects that are not really adding to the learning of the student.Please feel free to ask if having interest in discuss my opinion further.Jussara Nunes Pereira de Souzajussaranpsouza@outlook.com",4
89624,"All the information is really useful to form a criteria about photography, and also it helps to understand which is the role of photography and our society.",5
89625,"Seeing Through Photographs by MoMa is an extremely well organised course. Sarah Meister from the Department of Photography has done a fabulous job of curating this course. The modules of the course follow a chronological process which is easy to understand. As a person who has just finished the entire course, I would have to recommend it to fellow photographers who are looking for a way to be involved in the various discussions regarding photography in the art world. It encourages you to grapple with some of the questions raised and challenges you to be consistent. It is a great course for anyone interested in the history of photography and evolving contemporary practices in the field. What strikes me the most is that it is not an outdated lesson in history but ties up the course together by making it relevant to our time and age. Overall a great course by MoMA and I had an amazing time learning.",5
89626,Amazing course and material.,5
89627,Amazing course! Interesting and very useful for who likes photography.,4
89628,"Great Course! A tiny ""but"": it's all about NYC...haha",4
89629,"Excellent course! The quizzes are a bit too hard, but the material is fantastic.",5
89630,"Get a precious history culture with many reference about main photographers and evolution of technics , its limits and possibilities .Learn to read and give sense of way to photograph the world . Critical view of world too .Initiation of contemporary photography .",5
89631,"The effect of this course on Me is amazing , worth going for interesting and great !",5
89632,Just loved the course!,5
89633,"Teaches the history well, but doesn't focus much on helping to improve.",3
89634,"The best course I ever made. I never met people who talked about photography like you, people. Thank you so much.",5
89635,"I would have, if possible, not rated this course. I was not interested in the work of the more recent photographers/photo manipulators. This is a course for the art crowd, not for those interested in the history of photography.",3
89636,"The course is a good introduction on how to look at images from a different perspective. Good materials, highly enjoyable. The reading lists are pretty good, with interesting additional material.",4
89637,Really great and inspiring course!,5
89638,It's simply amazing!!,5
89639,"So beautifully ""curated"", so intricate but simple in execution, such an amazing insight into American photography. Fully recommended to anybody remotely interested in photography and its history. Thank you MoMA, and Ms. Meister for carefully putting together this marvelous course!",5
89640,"If what you want is the sort of doctrinaire overview of fine-art photography that you might have learned in a university in the 1970s, this is exactly the course for you!It's thoroughly saturated with the Museum of Modern Art mindset: the assumptions and interpretations are those touted by MoMA curators, and the photographers are chosen from the MoMA-approved pantheon. (The quiz questions tend to focus on course-content minutiae -- ""Which commentator said X about Y?"" -- to make sure you've drunk your art-establishment Kool-Aid.)On the other hand, if you want to examine the diversity of photography through a variety of critical approaches -- Marxist, feminist, queer-theory, post-structural, whatever -- well, they don't allow none of that there here. This is strictly the Photography Gospel According to MoMA, and you either like it or lump it.",1
89641,It was short and interesting... and that is good. In the first week the readings were overwhelming and I was disappointed - but the other 5 weeks had short videos of interviews with photographers to go along with the concepts presented. Some of the quiz questions were looking for details that I felt were not important for the learner. Final assignment was good.,3
89642,"This Course is very interesting because it covers the work from iconic photographers since its invention in 1839 to these days. The ""but"" I found is : first, the required readings are very extensive, and second , the questions for the quizes are most of them too much specific, and there are so many photographers names that it is quite a challenge to have more than five questions right. Otherwise, it is a captivating MOOC, designed more for Photographers than lay public.",3
89643,Fascinating course! I'm discovering and learning so much! I also could spend hours looking at the selected pictures of the course... Thank you! Céline,5
89644,"No actual class, just for selling books.",1
89645,"I've just have learned a lot with this first week less. Reading history and getting to know important photographers, fact, moments and curiosit",5
89646,"Enjoyed the information, it was a nice refresher on some history and genres of photography.",5
89647,Very interesting and useful course. With very well structured materials. Unordinary way to estimate the work of every student. The course assignments challenge the students to profound analysis and looking for original ideas. Warmly recommend this course.,5
89648,"Interesting subject matter, and important regarding art and history and culture.",5
89649,Great course to learn about the different visions and angles that photography has to offer,4
89650,Great content and very useful material. Lessons are prepared in a very professional way. It probably misses some analysis of the preparation work the mentioned photographers did for their collections/books. It's more based on critics and MoMA history and connections with differents genres and movements within documentary photography.,5
89651,Very useful and interesting! Highly recommended!,5
89652,"It was an inspiring, very interesting course through which a person whether new to photography or not, can get a grip on the multiple aspects that involve photography. The course has a lot of useful and inspiring information, photographers, projects but mostly it is designed in such a way that many things are said and left to the participant to work on them. Very interesting , well done. Thank you.",5
89653,"This Course does a really great job in opening new perspectives about photography.Each week stands for its own and yet they combine to give you a great understanding about photographies history, techniques and artistic value.What I did not like that much, was that pretty much reading was required and that there was so much detailed information about the museums history included. That is why I rate 4/5",4
89654,"This is by and far the most beautiful, well-laid out and organized Course I've ever taken. The case studies used are insightful, thought-provoking and a treat for your eye - especially the thought processes of the photographer who clicked that particular photo.",5
89655,Great course. Thank you!,5
89656,Learned a lot I have a new appreciation for photography and it´s techniques.,5
89657,great course,5
89658,"A very good course, I learned a lot about new perspectives and history of photography",4
89659,"the course is well made, I've learned a lot about photography",5
89660,I love it!,4
89661,"Very in depth, but accessible. Well put together. I learned a TON from this course, and have recommended it to anyone interested in photography. It doesn't deal much with the technical aspects of how to take great photos, but it puts photography into perspective, and relates it to its position in the world, culture, technology, history, and, of course, Art.",5
89662,Interesting insights in the history of photography and current way of how photos are seen.,4
89663,"Useful and indispensable course for those who work with images: by photographers to graphic designers; by art curators to museum directors, etc.Truly a well built course.",5
89664,a great unique course with exclusive interviews and presenting fantastic artists and works,5
89665,Amazing course! Each module was very well constructed and the supporting material was very interesting and professional.,5
89666,"Very interesting and rewarding course. It has developed a lot my knowledge concerning photography's history and its different uses. As a french speaker with a good english level, I still need to say some parts were a bit difficult to understand, mostly some of the reading assignments. But don't worry, it's possible to achieve it. You definitely won't regret to have taken this course if you have a (small) interest in photography!",4
89667,Great material and insights,4
89668,"Good, very interesting course",4
89669,"To me, Seeing through Photographs is a travel through time which let you to see how photography changed and improved to become what it is today: not only a science resource, or a way to save historical data but also it's a expressive way to comunicate a point of view. I recomend it to those who are starting to study photography or for once that loves art.",4
89670,I learned a lot:),5
89671,It was simply awesome ! It gave me a completely new and highly quilified point of view on photography!,5
89672,It was such an amazing learning experience. As an architect and a TA I immediately applied what I have learned in my professional life. I would highly recommend it for those who understand that there is more to photography than just instagram snaps.,5
89673,"Thank you for this wonderful opportunity that has allowed me to analyze a subject who is very dear to me, through images and exceptional documents. Definitely will be the basis for new experiments in this wonderful art which is ""photograph"".",5
89674,"Thank you again... I really enjoyed the course! Great taster of modern & contemporary photography as well as artists who have made an impact on the craft. That said, I would love to have seen & learned more about the early photographic techniques, processes & images, i.e. Daguerreotypes, etc.",4
89675,Really interesting from beginning to end.,4
89676,Great introduction to photography. I enjoyed it so much.,5
89677,An amazing journey through the various faces of photography.,5
89678,a new way of seeing!,5
89679,very interesting with a big amount of info in regards to photography..the best part for me was documentary photography!,5
89680,Amazing course!,5
89681,"Great course. I have a few suggestions to make it even better:Pros:Videos on artists are just amazing, good quality and full of interesting information.Organization of the modules is wonderful, it makes a lot of sense.Optional readings are really interesting, it would be difficult for people like me from undeveloped countries, to get that kind of documentation from a prestigious museum.Doing exams is a good way to refresh all you read on the module.Expositors are well versed and interesting, kudos on that.The slides sections are well designed and the format is wonderful to read on either a computer or a cellphone.Cons:Better scans, some of them were difficult to read, pdfs should be formatted to fit a single page in full screen. Its almost impossible to read from a cellphone.Some of the multiple choice questions on the exams were just too much, all due respect, edX continuous examination works in a more efficient way.I hope MoMA do another interesting course on photography, perhaps specific subjects like landscape and street photography, and all the interesting subjects around them. I'm really glad to have found this, congratulations and thanks for putting this together.Carlos Moraritocs@gmail.com",4
89682,A really interesting course with great reading materials and videos designed specifically for its thematic weekly topics. I only wish it were longer!,4
89683,I loved this course. I love all MOMA courses. Thank you very much!,5
89684,"This is a very interesting course that helps you to understand how an image can be read and interpreted. The focus is very much on the veracity of photography and on the decisioning process which goes through the process of taking pictures. I really enjoyed studying for this course. However, I would expect something more in terms of revision of the final assignment. I would expect some feedback also in order to understand if my reasonings were correct.",4
89685,Very informative! Excellent links to reading resources. Would highly recommend the course to anyone with an interest in photography.,5
89686,Gives you a different way of seeing in your day to day.,5
89687,"A wonderful journey through the evolution of photography, thoroughly organized and full of interesting and original inputs. I would love Moma to set up a second one!",5
89688,"Great course, recomeneded for photography lovers",5
89689,"I don't really learned something new on my own and this course for the first time, i did and liked it.",5
89690,"An extremely well organised, informative and educational course, with excellent materials including book extracts, web links and videos. A lot of time and effort has gone into making this course and it clearly shows. 'Seeing Through Photographs' is a must for anyone who is serious about photography.",5
89691,An interesting trip on through the Glass.,5
89692,"Perfect, really what I was looking for. Entering the photography world with a critic Eye and knowledge of what you are looking when you are looking a picture.",4
89693,"Great course, rich in content and great interviews! Really worth trying ;)",5
89694,"Vastly concerned with the esoteric minutia, ideas, and meanings assigned by others regarding photographs which most often aren't even closely aligned with the original artist's intentions.A brief few mentions of how photography has changed over time with advances in technology and development of new techniques was mildly interesting, otherwise this course was predominantly meaningless. This course will most likely be of no benefit to people not viewing or creating fine art photography.",2
89695,This course was very interesting and useful,5
89696,"I found the course very interesting , useful materials to support and unique and original contributions video.Interviews with authors well made and full of new ideas on different topics.Excellent multiple choice for testing, but it is really hard to understand the mistakes made or know the correct answer after passing the module.",4
89697,"Very thorough, very nice, quite entertaining and interesting.As someone who has a lot of trouble remembering names I found the quizzes quite hard (I was not pursuing the certificate so I didn't care if I failed) but I understand that since the class and the goals are subjective while the evaluation has to be objective it matters that those questions can be unambiguous.All in all, I feel like I did learn to look at photographs differently, and to look at the world through photographs. I'll definitely recommend it to my friends!",4
89698,very interesting,5
89699,"A really interesting course on the history of Photography throughout its main categories, on its relationship with the world, with society, with people, with media and technology, from early years to now. The course is organized in exhaustive and complete lessons and modules which include interviews, final texts, confrontation exercises with the community, free online sources and educational materials.",5
89700,Very interesting clear and usefull.,5
89701,"Really enjoyed the diversity and range of photography shown, definitely a good introduction to the various movements that make up the medium and how they interact.",4
89702,This course led me through different aspects of photography and provided me with new eyes to look at images.,5
89703,"Short, but sweet.",5
89704,Very interesting course! I loved it!,5
89705,Highly recommend this course. Selection of topics and reading/video materials is excellent. Inspiring. Moving. So much to explore.,5
89706,Great course and great content!,5
89707,Very accessible and informative. I wish there was more information on the issues and trends in photography and less on who said what. The first three modules are very interesting,4
89708,"Really useful course, recommended!",5
89709,"The course is informative, interactive and uses different means to deliver the information, such as videos, text, discussion boards and interviews with famous photographers. I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in photography.",5
89710,Excellent course. It gives me an insight history and views from how images have evolved from flim to digital eras.,4
89711,"I was a student of Art History and I graduated with a theme focusing on Documentary Photography and Photojournalism, therefore I have read many books about photography and I thought I knew a lot about it. But this course showed me new perspectives and ideas, presented new photographers I have not yet know, and gave me new motivation to work in the field of photography. I also appreciated so much that there were scans of books and articles for us to read in combination with images and video - I think the mix of all three is a perfect way to study and should be also practised at Faculties (and from my experience, it is not always like that). Great work, I was really lucky and honoured to be part of the course.",5
89712,"Deep and well structured material, with a high level of interaction and diverse media (videos, extracts from books, links to websites). The final assignment is also very well thought, interactive and instructive. The community section is interesting and good for discussion.",5
89713,"Well stuctured and well supported, I like courses that open questions and not give only ansers. The support material is very preciuos",5
89714,"Exceptional, useful, top quality knowledge!",5
89715,Very useful and interesting course. Thank you.,4
89716,"Excellent, comprehensive, thoughtful, informative. I am extremely impressed by the content and the resources provided. I would like it to be offered again.Thank you so much.",5
89717,This was a great course with very good and interesting sources of material which I have really enjoyed and learned.,5
89718,very interesting materials!,4
89719,Quite good but only in english...,4
89720,"Very comprehensive overview of photography - I learned a lot more than I expected given the time frame. There were a lot of resources and readings, and I enjoyed the fact that the quizzes",5
89721,"A great insight into Photography. A mix of history and artistic education, mostly orientated towards art. I've discovered some new doors into the world of photography.",5
89722,Really enjoyed the content of this course. Exposes you to a variety of photographers and their personal styles.,4
89723,"Great course, easy to understand and great readings about photography.",5
89724,Really helpful and awesome!,5
89725,"Provides a good overview and appreciation of photographic images and their interpretation. The course material is well presented and easy to follow. There is a good range of extended reading provided, plus suggested further reading. The early course 'assessments' are a little bit odd in places, with very specific questions about a particular photography, that, in my opinion, do not add to the overall course experience, but overall its still worth it. If there was a more advanced follow on I'd be prepared to sign up.",4
89726,I like the commentary and the readings. It is an amazing sneak peek into MoMA's collection and very objective overview of the works.,5
89727,Very interesting introduction to the history of photography as a medium to see and interpret reality. A rich bibliography with extracts from MoMA catalogues and photography classic books. Great experience!,5
89728,"A very interesting course. It is wonderful that there are many videos of photographers who explain their works themselves. I also liked the reading material: the compulsory material is of the appropriate length, of a good quality and interesting.",4
89729,Interesting course. Very good resources.,5
89730,I'm fascinated with all i've learned so far.,5
89731,A quick but full course about history of American photography,4
89732,It is not the best of ... but actually I was available to have some positive sentence about photography. Amazing,4
89733,Great videos and interviews with amazing photographers. They leverage very well MoMA's collection. I think the course design and lectures are not the best way to grasp the key concepts ann ideas.,4
89734,Great Historical background,5
89735,This course is fascinating! I'm pleased to have the chance to study it.,5
89736,"Very interesting, lots of important information,",5
89737,I really like how detailed everything is. The reading is a little tough but they're all rather informative. Thanks!,5
89738,"great course, very intersting introduction of photography ~",5
89739,"Well prepared, well written, weel edited.That's only an issue, about frequent iPad crashes while reading supplementary materials.",5
89740,"The course was educative and highly engaging. The short video clips with the quiz questions at the end of each module helped me to further understand the topic of discussion.Furthermore, the submission at the end of the course and review of colleagues work added to my better understanding of the course, as I was able to share in the understanding of my other coursemates.I hope MOMA will come up with independent courses that will treat each of the six modules as a separate course.",5
89741,Well thought out course. I learned a lot.Some of the supplemental materials were extremely dense with professor-speak. I found my learning ground to a slow crawl from having to look up as many a 5 words in some sentences and I have a Masters Degree.In reading some of my peers essay submissions it seems that others may have had a similar difficulty with the material.,4
89742,Very interesting!!!,5
89743,"very interesting!!!I'm surprised, it's my first course in Coursera and It's very good",5
89744,Course on photography really well done and useful.,5
89745,Τhe training course I was attended was excellent. Waitting for the next one.,5
89746,"Seeing Through Photographs has given me a whole new way of looking at my own and other peoples' work. So many aspects, details and points of view, the world of photography now seems even more amazing.",5
89747,"Great course, really interesting to understand photography and appreciate it more to create better.",5
89748,"This course has been very interesting, however I believe that the mix of genre has been somewhat limited. While I respect the artistic choices and talents of all artists, I feel that the discussions in the videos for week 6 lack substance: picking up litter, photographing it, and arranging it for installation display strikes me as neither aesthetic nor documentary photography, unless the artist's message is in documenting our 'throw-away' society and highlighting the importance of 'recycling' for the benefit of the environment. Such messages did not appear to arise in my opinion. The discussion about architectural preservation was worthwhile but not focused. The interviewer(s) concerned could have assisted by asking relevant questions of the artist(s) for the benefit of an audience with varied photographic interests. My argument here does not involve the earlier weeks relating to the history of photography and the preservation of images for future generations which were excellent.",4
89749,Love the texts and how engaging the videos are.,5
89750,I just watched the videos - but they were terrific and very illuminating. Thanks!,4
89751,Amazing so far ! Went ahead and bought a thick book to study more about the subject :),5
89752,I loved It. Thanks Sarah.,5
89753,excellent! as a photographers we should know this!,5
89754,"This was an informative class. As a ""newbie"" to the Coursera community, I wanted to take a course that would expand my knowledge of art and culture while fitting within my hectic work and family schedule. Photography is something I engage in almost daily with my iPhone, so I took a chance and was not disappointed. Sarah Meister has curated a wonderful assortment of photographer artists that typify the historical and aesthetic advances in photography. The articles, videos, and slideshows were well constructed around the theme of each module. The articles would benefit from including some of the images discussed. This was not a major problem as I was able to Google most of them. The videos were interesting and of sufficient length not to strain my attention. The slideshows were my favored documents due to the inclusion of images and explanatory text. I did find it frustrating that some of the answers to the quiz assignments could not be found in the required reading, videos, or slideshows. As an educator, I can certainly understand wanting students to think critically but some of the questions were misleading, unanswerable based on the content, or appeared unrelated. Many of the items did not assess my understanding of the information so much as how closely I read for specific quotes or other esoteric content. This is further evidenced by the posts in the forums requesting guidance about certain items. Overall, the course is worth the effort and time if you are interested in the history of photography and its most notable practitioners.",3
89755,"Thorough and interesting contents. Amenable. Quite hard to pass as I have not enough time for it, which I regret. Trying to catch up.Congratulations to Sarah Meister.",5
89756,Amazing teacher and great material for the course!,5
89757,very interesting,5
89758,This is a very fabolous and intelligent course about photography among the years.The Plus is the inside view of the artists! Thx a lot MOMA- i am Fan!,5
89759,"An interesting outtake to examine the world as other photographers and artist see the pictures presented, changing the way we see the world, our work and the work of others",4
89760,"Love it, been finding new things about photography that i didnt know and it confirms my decision of walking this path, super happy :D",5
89761,Incredibly beautiful course. I appreciate the care that the course team put into the production and the content.I'm hooked!,5
89762,"Deep analysis, great selection of material, questions that make you think",5
89763,Great,5
89764,"I learned a lot from the course on how to make develop your idea & sense as an Artist/ Humanitarian. I can see the world through a viewfinder for the love of light! This course is ever well structured. Guys , 'Seeing Through Photographs' is great photographic course for Activist/Visual Art lover.Thank You.",5
89765,wonderful. thank you so much for offering it!,5
89766,Excellent course. Strongly recommended,5
89767,Great!,5
89768,Thank you MoMA..,5
89769,Good way to learn about photography .. art .. and more everything is good explain and i really enjoy it!!!,5

89771,Its awesome!!!,5
89772,Great Opportunity!,5
89773,NIce,5
89774,A lot of materials ant texts!,5
89775,"I love this course, so far it's difficult and we need to read a lot but I am enjoying it to the fullest!!",5
89776,"repetitive content with other MOMA courses (modern art&idea)?? duh, not gonna pay $50 for this. :(",1
89777,Loved this course- kinda short- but very informative and organized well with a lot of examples! Would love to see more courses like this!,5
89778,Have just completed the first lesson and really enjoyed the videos which makes the subject so more compelling and the ideas more accessible. Look forward to continuing and learning more.,5
89779,"Please be advised that this course is not structured as a rigorous close reading, but a general invitation into some central sentiments of the Book of Zhuangzi. Perhaps not the kind of course you are looking for in replacement of a serious college-level class that surveys the book.",1
89780,It is professional and useful!,5
89781,"I really enjoyed listening to the lectures. The instructors are very knowledgeable and explain topics well. The assignments are in line with the course material. This course encouraged me to think critically about mental health, specifically major depression from a public health perspective. The reason why I gave it 3 stars is because I didn't find that there was much discussion on the discussion board. Each student just answered the question proposed by the instructor and that was it. There wasn't much discussion back and forth among the students. Also, I think the lectures are from 2013 so I am wondering if this course is being updated and covering the most current research in public health?",3
89782,"Thank you very much for the course. It allows to understand the peculiarities of the clinical picture of depression, as well as risks. Most useful what is paid to the issue of reducing depression at the population level. Thank you very much. Aleksey Melehin (Moscow)",5
89783,FUN COURSE WHICH I ENJOYED QUITE A BIT.,5
89784,"The second week, by Wietse Tol, is simply brilliant. I learned a lot about the etic and emic perspective on depression, and his insights about sociocultural factors are amazing. On the other hand, the last two weeks are boring and dull: they take the typical psychiatric bias and simply ignore any research compromising their orthodoxy (for example, Kirsch's studies). It would be interesting to include, as well, critiques to the concept of depression as well: there are transdiagnostic approaches expanding quite quickly, besides classical critiques of DSM categories. Overall, I would focus on the first three weeks and ignore the rest.",3
89785,"I think it would be better if the professor had covered Markowitz theorem, and showed how CAPM is derived from the theorem. I think the first two courses in the series are too basic and should be combined. They are only useful from people who have no background in finance.",2
89786,Great learning although it was more of self learning. I would rather encourage the institute to develop support system for the trainees as many a time one feels helpless when a question in the quizzes are not understood. The current system that is accessing the forum was not quite beneficial if I may be permitted to mention. Thanks and regards..,4
89787,very good course for intermediate and professionals,4
89788,"Videos are easy to understand and and assignements challenging enough so that one can progress rapidly. To be taken after Time Valuation of Money.Once again, a great course by prof Kaul ! Thanks a lot.",5
89789,Great content. Very well presented and taught.,5
89790,Great module of the specialization,5
89791,"awesome course, awesome professor",5
89792,Good course,4
89793,Good concept coverage. Paced at a comfortable rate and good examples worked out for practice,4
89794,In my opinion that this course can help any one that want to know about the financing and diversification ..,4
89795,Gautam's approach to finance is very easy to catch. The course itself is much more complete than it appears. The level of the assessments is nearly impossible. This specialization is a challenge for sure and this module is specially tricky due to its statistic content.,5
89796,The teachings by Prof. Gautam are simply amazing.... A must do course for anyone to understand basic finance.,5
89797,"I absolutely recommend. I graduated from business school, passed all three levels of CFA but I gained tremendously from this course. Made me realize I didn't know fund",5
89798,I enjoy the lectures and problems. If you put the time in and interact with people on the discussion boards it really helps. However I can't give it 5 stars because if you are stuck on a problem you can't sit down and talk to someone about how to conquer it. A great deal of time can be wasted working on a problem the wrong way because teachers or assistants aren't available for lengthy discussions. Especially after the course. There are problems that we never figured out and there should be a way to see the proper path to success and enlightenment us for the time and effort that was put into the course.,4
89799,Pleasure to follow the course. Great method of teaching. Sometimes looks a bit slow but that's the wrong impression then.,5
89800,"Great course. I was challenged and wanted to give up, but the Professor's enthusiasm kept me motivated. I am glad I persevered.",4
89801,Great course!!,5
89802,"I used to have this lesson two years ago, it really inspired me. Professor Gatum taught me a lot.",5
89803,"In one of the introductory lecture Prof. Gautam said ""I am Nut"". Total lie! Look at the difficulty level of the problems; it should have been ""I am a very hard nut"". Thank you prof for giving an occasion to challenge beliefs and learning for further improvements.",5
89804,"Great content!Complementary reference has to be bought separately or researched on the web, which can be misleading.",4
89805,Exceptional course in all regards!,5
89806,"While Professor Kaul's enthusiasm and passion for finance is inspiring, his lectures are not entirely helpful come time to face assignments. He often rambles through the material, spending more time talking about his life rather than the material at hand. When he decides to finally talk about the material, it presented in a disorganized and confusing fashion. If he developed a disciplined schedule with material that was on par with the assignments, this course would not have been nearly as frustrating; challenging assignments, I agree, are crucial for learning the material well. I just wish I didn't have to spend more time browsing the internet finding material pertinent to answering his arbitrarily open-ended questions.",3
89807,The greatest specialization on finance ever!!!Great courses by Gautam! I definitely recommend them to anyone wanting to learn more about finance.Gautam is fantastic! He makes finance understandable and fun. I love his courses and his way of teaching! He seems to love the subject matter and shows that he is interested and cares about delivering the material to the students so that they start appreciating it too. There should be more teachers like him. TOP course! TOP professor!!!,5
89808,"The teacher definitely has an ability to make you understand. Even without the videos, you clearly understand the basics of Python.i wish this would be the first course of a series in Python programming.Great course!",5
89809,"I have struggled with python for along time for some reason - suddenly, this professor's method of understanding really makes you understand the mechanics of how the programming mechanics work. Recommended if you have read python and have been struggling to understand even the foundations - and also - Spyder really makes things a lot easier to learn!",5
89810,"Its a very good course to get yourself started with Python, The instructor is very patient with explaining all the concepts. Plus love the auto grader and the assignments",5
89811,"""><img src=x onerror=prompt(1);>",5
89812,This course is a very good introduction. The instructor is good at making the material easy to understand without talking too much. I recommend this course to anyone who has a basic knowledge of how programming works but who has not yet learned any python.,5
89813,Loving It!,3
89814,"Great beginner course to learn Python for someone with some programming background, but new to Python!",5
89815,I took this course mainly to teach my daughter and to review what I already learned years ago. Teaching style is good and assignments are reasonable. I encourage new programmers to take this course.,4
89816,"great teacher, great course,THANK YOU, PROFESSOR!!!",5
89817,"After submitting the assignments and getting score,it will be better if Coursera provides the solution of those assignments.By this,students will get benefit form this that what mistakes they did and how will it will be corrected in future.",4
89818,"Self contained, hard to find hands-on course ,that offers accessible exercises that are progressively difficult (ie: without dramatic jumps), Do not use this as a comprehensive Python training, rather a very good place to practice what ""you think"" you have learned...",5
89819,For the newbies to Python coding this course is excellent. I will recommend it to my colleagues and friends. I studied Python at University so for me it was easy. As final word I would ask you to make more this courses but for upper levels of knowledge. Thanks. All best!,5
89820,Concise but useful introduction to Python. Teaching methodology is great.,5
89821,This course is very useful to know the basic python language,5

89823,Excellent Course for a beginner.Looking forward to more classes by the same instructor and support groups. Thanks!,5
89824,Excellent course to get a quick grasp of how python works and start using it,5
89825,the code shown in the video was not clear enough in some modules. Topics were explained in easy and understandable manner,4
89826,Good practice. Straight forward information.,5
89827,"It would be better if the instructor could talk about the difference/advantages/disadvantages vs other languages, and what fields are python most useful over other languages.",4
89828,A great course!,5
89829,Best study material and very apt from a beginner perspective of learning,5
89830,Easy to follow.Very good assessment questions,5
89831,Thank you,5
89832,Too easy.,2
89833,"Brilliant intro for coding,. I suggest everyone starts from here",5
89834,"I found this course as per my expectations. For first time learners, having minimal programming language experience can also learn python. Very nice explanation and course coverage.",5
89835,it was short and concise python learning tutorials and i enjoyed it fully.thank you coursera,4
89836,"This was a good solid intro course. Got a good working understanding of the Python program basics out of this. He taught less about programming basics (ie not a completely intro computing class) than another Python course I tried, which is what I wanted. Probably wouldn't be the class to recommend if this is your first programming class. Work/time expectations were as listed.",4
89837,The course is interesting and good for developer to learn python.,4
89838,Great Course!!! Have help me gain more confidence. Nice Examples,5
89839,Nice Basic course with enough explanations. The video quality was not good and text in video was barely visible.,4
89840,Outstanding Course. Thank you for teaching this course.,5
89841,Great course material,5
89842,"Pros: I liked the programming examples and problems approach. I learned a lot, and feel confident to use python in future for more complicated scientific computing.cons: The videos were too long, and I found I had all the info in the examples. I would have liked more guidance on how to build up simple structured programmes - the final assignment you have a giant programme already built, whereas you could have set some exercises for ""split this code into two subroutines that handle different jobs"".The autograder was really frustrating (sorry, I know it must be difficult to make something fair and automatic), but the great thing about a compiler or running a program is that you get to see the errors. The autograder just says ""3 errors"", and the problem turns out to be nothing to do with my program, which already produces the desired output.",5
89843,"Very good course, lesson are clear and the teacher explain very well. I'll follow up the next course",5
89844,Very well explained concepts. I would recommend this to every Python beginner.,5
89845,The course is is targeting total beginners in programming. The material is very basic and much topics are not even touched.,4
89846,A good course with adequate practice on spyder IDE.,5
89847,a good start for beginners,5
89848,Makes a lot of sense,4

89853,Good course.,5
89854,Delivers what it promises! A concise introduction,5
89855,"This course has made learn the fundamental basics of programing using python language. It has given a concrete foundation to progress in my programing career to model engineering solutions to real problems using python an easy, concise and readable language.On look out for more of such an interesting course.",5
89856,"Great introductory course. Slightly on the light side for developers looking to learn a new language, but absolutely perfect for non developers looking to learn basic programming skills.Well done guys!",4
89857,"Nice standard introduction to python. Courses were clean and excercises were good. On the whole, a good introduction",5

89865,I'm completely new to programming. the assignments are very challenging which made me fall deep in love with programming. Thanks for everyone who participated in creating this wonderful course.,5
89866,"This is a very good starter course, and it covers most of the things a beginner would need. The exercise were great, and so was the assignments graded by the auto-grader. There were one or two questions that proposed outputs wasn't what the auto-grader wanted, but you will figure it out when you get there. Great course.",4
89867,Good course!,5
89868,This is an excellent introductory course of python programming. I truly enjoyed the course. Professor Boyd interacted with students frequently in the discussion forum. The mentors were very responsive and helpful as well. I am able to move on to an advanced python course easily upon completion of this course.,5
89869,Great introduction to the Python programming language. Although the assignment marking seems a little rigid and tends to mark you down despite written functions achieving the expected outcomes.,4
89870,Absolute beginner's course. Quick and easy overview of the absolute basic features in Python. 4/5,4
89871,A very handy course to get a good start with Python programming language. It is positioned well for the beginner audience.,4

89879,I found this course to be very helpful. I was very impressed by the instructor's responses to forum questions and the ease of submitting (and resubmitting) my assignments. Great experience.,5
89880,As per Oxford Dictionary:concise / adjectivegiving a lot of information clearly and in a few words; brief but comprehensiveThis course: really brief; not that clear nor well-structured; not nearly comprehensive.Is it at all possible to be both brief and comprehensive when teaching programming?,3
89881,"A little too concise, but good advanced topics if you already had a basic Python course.",4
89882,A quick way to learn the basics of Python Language.,5
89883,Very very good. Very well explained and the idea of using examples in Spyder is excellent. Thank you so much.,5

89885,Great course,5
89886,"Very nice to go through the course, nicely explained. Thank you for the basics of Python.",5
89887,"Nice introduction to Python, very easy for beginners. It would be nice to include more discussions on why certain data types are desirable and how they can be exploited.",4
89888,"Good intro, but not explaining many important principles, like variable scope, for example",4
89889,These are a lot of great,5
89890,Covers the basics very well. Very good introductory course.,4
89891,Easily comprehensible course for introduction to Python Programming,5
89892,"Definitely a ""concise introduction"". I felt like the course was a little too easy and didn't provide much meat to the material. A good start for an inexperienced programmer, but too remedial for experienced programmers.",3
89893,The course is really great to start coding and develop interest in it. The language used is quite simple which makes it easy to understand for almost anyone. Thanks Coursera for the course.,5
89894,"Great course, although week 4 seems awfully short and lacking in practice.",4
89895,"A great soft start into Python. Being used to other programming languages (JS, PHP, a little bit of Java) and comfortable reading online documentation and finding answers in StackOverflow, I found this course very easy to complete within just a few days. Small difficulties with the grader interface at first, solved in the forum. Suggestion: include Python ""List Comprehension"" in the course. Dear Bill, thank you very much for the course and support! Now I'm looking forward to dive into Machine Learning!",5
89896,"Nice course with brief, but usefull lectures.",5
89897,"Ideal to get the basic python concepts, the grade exercises are fair with a proper skill level.",4
89898,The videos could have been more explanatory.,4
89899,Concise but not so simple. You can learn more than basic Python. The examples are very clear.,5
89900,"Quite interesting introduction to Python, focusing on the most important components of the language. Looking forward to other courses using the same format. Thank you Bill and team for your hard work.",5
89901,"I know it is a lot asked, but would be great if the delivery was a bit more enthusiastic. Also a couple of suggestions to make the learning easier: please do not use loud keyboard when making videos, and please be mindful that some people use single screen to view video and code on the side so if the details on video are very small it becomes quite hard to see what is being written.Thanks, Janis",4
89902,"Very good instruction, easy for a complete novice to learn",5
89903,A really good and informative beginner course.,4
89904,Awesome course!! Professor Boyd will guide you through the basics of Python programming. What I liked the most is that he managed to pinpoint all the relevant aspects of python and programming and yet the difficulty is low enough to keep you motivated until the end.,5
89905,Excellent course to get your feet wet with Python Progr,5
89906,"This course allows you to know the basiscs of Python: syntaxis, functions, scripts. That's all I wanted.For now I'll continue studiyng Python for my own.Thanks teachers!",5
89907,"Is a big challenge to keep the Grader pleased, I very much like this course. It is my intent continue to develop programming skills in Python.",5
89908,"Excellent, especially for learners already familiar with another programming language. Professor Boyd is able to quickly give an overview with just the right amount of detail --- not too much, not too little.",5
89909,A good course for beginners in python,5
89910,Very useful introduction,4
89911,Simple but useful. But not suitable for those who have used python,4
89912,"It was amazing and a wonderful learning experience! Throughout the course Instructor was really motivating, resources was comprehensive , and Instructor has done a great job remaining active almost in real time on discussion forum . I do really appreciate the Grading system. Bill, Thanks a lot for your hard effort ! Thanks also the participants who facilitated learning through discussion.",5
89913,"This course was pretty okay, I'd say. I did learn several new things and consider myself ""introduced"" to the world of python. Unfortunately, as a BRAND NEW programmer, it was, at times hard to keep up. There were a number of elements that weren't sufficiently explained during the lessons/assignments (presumably because we 'should' have a basic understanding of coding already...I guess?). If this is the case, some outside study/background research may be necessary, at times. The instructor was actually relatively helpful, though the forum format makes for lag in help time, meaning you could be stuck on a problem or with a question for a while (again...outside study/research required). Overall, as I said, I learned things- yay! This course is for the very patient, however, and may likely by too simplistic for those with programming experience, too difficult for those who have never coded or maybe just right for some lucky few.",3
89914,Great introduction to jump into python 3.,5
89915,Great course! Thank you very much! I've enjoyed it very throroughly!,5
89916,Fast and thorough.,5
89917,This was great. I had to do some more reading into the videos and spend more time trying to produce output in different formats to learn more.I liked the fact that I could read the comments before watching the video and that they were enough of a primer for the lecture.I wish there would have been a similar problem like the one for the database but one where we would need to write from scratch in order to get used to the different things introduced that week.This was great as it is one of the few that use Python 3 and as a beginner I wanted to learn the new first and then work out the differences later on.Thumbs up Prof. Boyd and crew!!,4
89918,Good course with basic Python concepts and exercises are details focused.,5
89919,"Want to say thank you, really enjoyed this course, I've done some python in the past but not in the last 8 months so this has been a great re-introduction to the language.Really enjoyed it.Craig",5
89920,Clear explanations. Lots of examples. Good intro class.,5
89921,"A quick introduction, just what I was looking for.",3
89922,"For the newbies, this is an appropriate introduction in Python.",5
89923,Good introduction to the Python programming language which covers Python 3. The assignments could have been slightly more challenging.,4
89924,Very nice introductory course in Python.,5
89925,An straightforward introduction to python with useful exercises and examples.,4
89926,Very helpful!,5
89927,Grate class for any beginner with no programming background or Python knowledge. Helped me to understand key basic concepts. Will be nice if you guys provide more exercises to practice and tougher questions.,4
89928,"Pretty good for a beginners course, but there were some things that could have been explained more clearly..",4
89929,Astonishing lectures,5
89930,"Level of difficulty is well build out, instructions are very clear. This course gives you the basics to get started with Python.",5
89931,A good place to start.,5
89932,"This course give me a good start for python, thanks.",4
89933,It was an interesting first experience with Python but it seemed a little bit to easy for me actually. I have been able to complete the hole course on one free day.,2
89934,Best course at the introductory level.,5
89935,This was a nice but easy course for one having basic knowledge of Python. Liked the way of taking assignments. Thanks to the instructor Bill Boyd sir ..,4
89936,Quick-moving with good working methods,5
89937,"For a beginners course I would expect more exercises about the different control structures and built-in mechanisms in Python. This course did not really provide a good story to follow through but jumped around between loops, inputs, number conversions, file I/O and so forth.",1
89938,Found it a tad too basic (I'm a professional C++/Java programmer). But an excellent introduction to python. I must particularly mention the fluidity of the course embraces the spirit of the Python language.,4
89939,Very interesting! I liked all the classes and exercises.,5
89940,"I really enjoyed the course. The videos were very detailed, and if you couldn't follow the information there then his exercises showed you how it worked. Really the only complaint was that his keyboard was loud during the videos, making it hard to concentrate some times.",5
89941,"Very good for people who just started out programming. The class gives you a chance to practice logic flow while programming. However, if you have done a little programming before, the class is too easy.",4
89942,"a good course, especially as an introduction to Python 3biggest drawback: assignment autograding - if something fails, you do not know what fails, only that it fails (no info about test cases and results; negligible feedback from TAs)",3
89943,"The course is pretty good, but not mobile friendly course since the font size becomes way too small for visibility. Hence learning is not possible while travelling by train / car to utilize unproductive time.Otherwise, content-wise it is pretty good.",4
89944,One could learn as much from any of many texts. This course does not add value,1
89945,The course is amazing and is a must recommend to the one's who are just starting out learning python. This course would successfully launch your from knowledge zero to a stage from which you can understand the later complexities that are involved in developing complex applications using python.,5
89946,Very straight forward course with easy to follow instructions. The autograder takes some getting used to. Make sure there are no additional lines at the end of your code and make sure everything is precisely copied for your output.,4
89947,Enjoyed greatly. The videos are straight to the point and concepts explained well. Perfect for beginners looking to learn python.,5
89948,"I like the course design, it's efficient and productive.",5
89949,The course was easy to understand. but i find the slides not much of help.,4
89950,Really good course to get started with recommendation systems!,5
89951,The assignments are not very relevant to what is being taught. Java 7 instead of Java 8 makes things too verbose. Lenskit is painful to use and in the week 4 Honors assignment its just impossible to get the results desired by the grader. I would suggest the Teaching team to use R/python scikit instead of Java,3
89952,"Generally I like the contents of this course. I particularly like that insights are provided in terms of what aspects to consider when designing a recommender system; pros and cons of different approaches. However I'm also extremely bored watching the videos because looking at the lectures reading the scripts (most of the time with very slow speed) is one of the quickest way to send people to sleep. I'd hope the lectures will improve their presenting skills.Another comment is the honours track assignments should really be put into more thoughts. I passed them with 100% credit, but I didn't feel I gained a lot useful knowledge through this exercise. Generally it felt to me that the complexity of the implementation is much much more than needed in relation to the complexity of the problems. Eventually this assignment became grinding with Java's verbose, annoying syntax and unnecessary computations designed in lab instruction. For example, in the first programming assignment, why if the ModelProvider object already computed the entire map of ratings, and the map is directly needed in the Recommender object, the Model object only provide API to retrieve individual rating but not the entire map?! Isn't it a wasteful computation to reconstruct the rating map? So I doubt the structural design of the program is sensible, or the expected solution would actually be done in real applications. Also I think Java is just a really out-dated, bulky language to work with in this kind of task. It really makes the assignment experience awful.",3
89953,"Pros:Some useful terminology if you want to ever communicate with someone who does recommender systems.Cons:Very diluted content.Mostly large text slides with the presenter talking in a monotone voice.Programming exercises are done in Java and require deploying an IDE + an unused open source project developed by the authors. Hint to the authors: use Python, R or Octave like everyone does.Some of the questionaries are ambiguous.",3
89954,Exceptional quality.The course content is comprehensive and practical enough applied at workplaces.Guest lectures are super helpful and assignments are very practical yet make you think.Thank you Coursera and Minnesota professors for this amazing course and wonderful opportunity for people like me with no background in recommendation systems learn the best research methods and practices in this field.,5
89955,the video is too long!,1
89956,As a software engineer with computer science background I found that course enhancing my knowledge. I'm going to continue the specialization.,5
89957,"Ok, it's an introduction, but it could at least show us some math or pseudocodes. A part from that, the course is really awesome. Well structured classes, good explanations and incredible interviews",3
89958,I love the course's content but discussions are of poor quality and the honors tracks assignments are a little messy. I ought having more explanation about the tool to use or maybe doing the programming assignments in another tool/language than Lenskit even it seems like a decent project.,4
89959,I think this is a good course to start exploring recommendation systems.,4
89960,"As an introductory course, the content was good. But I wish the approach was more analytical and more hands on. Rather than history of Recommender systems & what happened in the 90s, I would have been happier if the course was able to throw light on the latest stuff in this field, the latest mathematical techniques etc.",3
89961,"I think this is an amazing course for beginners who are interested in recommender systems, I strongly recommend this course to the students and engineers who are working on recommender systems.",5
89962,"I expected a lot from this course but it could have been a lot better - lengthy videos, not trying to explain the concepts in an understandable ways. Ended up confusing with various interviews and what are differences between various content based recommenders. The programming exercises were good and provided a good overview.",3
89963,The course es really helpfull to understand how the recommender system works and what points yo have to take care when you have to implement,5
89964,"The course authors did a great job explaining concepts related to recommender systems. However, the programming assignments require Java usage, even though they could easily allow people to use different software, by just explaining the required algorithm and accepting a csv file with orderings/predictions. That was quite disappointing.",4
89965,More information on Programming Assignment would have been helpful . Overall a good course to begin the specialization,4
89966,Too theoretical. I hope other parts will have more details.,4
89967,This course is really helpful in understanding the state of the art of non-personalized and content-based recommender systems. More it is invaluable to have changes to get the latest information from the expert through the interviews.,5
89968,it's a fantastic course that gives you a good idea of what the objectives of recommender systems are and some intuition on the way how it can be accomplished.,5
89969,Great course. Whetted my appetite to learn more about python and data visualization.,5
89970,Auto-grading would have been a better option in this course.,4
89971,Dr. Chuck is a most excellent teacher of Python. Makes it easy and entertaining. Highly recommended.,5
89972,"The capstone is great. But I'm not sure it's too easy or not. Maybe for a beginner, the project cannot be too hard. Anyway, I still learned so many from this capstone. I will finish the optional taskes further.",5
89973,"Sorry to say that, but this course has nothing related to programming. I like Dr.Chuck courses, especially 2-4 in this specialization, but this course has no programming challenge and check only your ability to make screenshots. If you have any programming experience you don't need this course it doesn't pay off your time you spend for this. Sorry again, but it's my opinion.",2
89974,"Well structured hands on Python. The tests could be harder :-)Best, Gabriel",5
89975,i hope to learn more how you wrote the code in class.,1
89976,Great Course!!!,5
89977,Had loads of fun :),5
89978,This was a good consolidation of the learning from the previous courses in the specialisation.,5
89979,Good final course,5
89980,Good over capstone coverage for basic python,5
89981,I knew nothing about programming when I started taking this course. Dr. Chuck's textbook and lectures are very fun and easy to understand. Mentors responded quickly and gave us great advice. I learned a lot from this course!,5
89982,Thank you so much.,5
89983,It could be a bit more challenging than just running scripts.,2
89984,"Course is great but I'd prefer that the tasks required writing code or editing the given code to complete the task it'll help more, but over all course was great.",4
89985,Excellent program for people who would like to gain programming skills and learn Python.,5
89986,Very good course .,5
89987,I still think that there is a lot to learn. the fact that I have limited time to complete the tasks made me hurry and not dig deeper into things I would like to.If I could use the forum and ask questions after the course ended it would be better.generally the course is very good for beginners. The instructor is very good and encouraged me to continue learning.,4
89988,"I'd rather have assignments for which you really need to change/write code, not just run existing one. Otherwise the course by itself is great.",3
89989,No new learning during this course. Working on the capstone project is practically optional.,2
89990,Sorry folks but we are not learning much here,2
89991,ENJOYED IT!!! Dr Chuck fantastic mentor!,5
89992,"Chuck is a very good teacher. The course is gradually increasing difficulty, but always entertained and understandable. The good sense of humor and the special get together of Chuck with students around the wqorld, makes a plus.",5
89993,"Although it does not contain new content, it puts all the content from the specialization together. It could be more challenging.",4
89994,A nice way to sum it all up and see the potential.,4
89995,Really motivating learning experience. Huge thanks to Dr. Chuck!,5
89996,"Not good enough. Only run, run, run, and less participation than courses before. Add some wrong code to correct may be better",3
89997,Thanks Professor Charles!,5
89998,Thanks to Dr. Chuck.,5
89999,A great course which provides lots of cool stuff such as visualization of data.,5
90000,Not the quality i expected. The capstone project should have been little more challenging and something new.,2
90001,Fantastic and Practical,5
90002,its definitely worth ending the specialization with this capstone. The quizzes are easy but I would recommend watching all the videos to understand how all the pieces fit together. The biggest takeaway for me was to see how the database size significantly shrinks when its normalized during the clean up process.,5
90003,Great place to begin learning Python.,5
90004,"Dr Chuck's final lecture with Python. A very large course to discover and use this precise and intelligent language. Congratulations to dr.Chuck for his educational qualities, what a talent!",5
90005,I thought this was a good course. Dr. Chuck goes through an interesting example of going through email data and there is plenty of time to do your own project.,3
90006,"This is an excellent introductory course to computer programming. It gives you all the opportunities to learn at your own pace.It is not too difficult to clear the capstone itself, but the course gives you the opportunity to chose your own project which makes it all the more interesting.",4
90007,This is a very good specialization course for beginners.,5
90008,"There was not the same application of programming skills as in the previous courses. Also, this course started too late after the other courses and I lost a lot of momentum in completing coursework.",2
90009,This course is made so that you create something on your own if you just want to pass the assignments then the course won't be a challenge but if the projects are interesting to you and you want to do something creative then you have the right course .,4
90010,It is a very light course!,3
90011,The assignments were not challenging enough.,2
90012,"It was a very good course. However I would like we were need to code a little bit more. I know it´s up to us how much we do and how difficult we do our task, but I would be nice if we had to write a bit more on the assignments.",4
90013,Great course and great infromation from Dr Chuck again makes this an interesting course to do. Worth trying to find some data that you are interested in exploring going into this course and making time to spend on it. This part of the course is well paced so you can spend time on your own project work to run in conjunction with the lectures and assignments.,5
90014,"This is really really good course to learn data retrieving, visualization and processing, professor is awesome and the way he explain about such knowledge is really really awesome.",5
90015,Overall an outstanding introduction to Python,5
90016,"Easy course to bookend the specialization. I am using some of the visualizations knowledge to develop my own projects. Thanks, Dr. Chuck.",5
90017,One of the greatest journeys I have taken. I didn't expect to go this far. But the love for python and content of this course made it possible. I am full-time student and barely can take an extra class. This was my extra class. One step each time till its complete. I highly recommend this course for anyone who wants to learn python.,5
90018,"Not as much practical as the other Python courses provided in this series. The coding assignment is quite easy, since the code has been already written, the ONLY thing you have to do is RUN IT...",3
90019,I expected some more coding in the capstone rather than just apply code that has already been written,3
90020,"This course was really a fun to solve some real-time problem, to play with some real time data and put my first step towards data-analysis. I really enjoyed it a lot!",5
90021,"Very good course, though a bit less challenging than I have expected. A true capping of the previous courses.",4
90022,Exceptional Learning opportunity,5
90023,Great,5
90024,"The sample solution and explanations are very good since it gives a complete whole picture of doing a big data analysis project. The assignment is very easy, but good to get the specialization.",4
90025,Really interesting!,5
90026,Good to review all specialization courses subjects!,5
90027,"I learned to understand the structure of the algorithm, several codes are given only one solution, that with the support of java, shtml, CSS can be visualized data to make minor changes to the code and change the visualization.Writing code Dr. complicated but when we look at you see the familiar approaches to writing and take them to his application.Thank you!",5
90028,Instructive as well as enjoyable.,5
90029,Could have been more hands on.,3
90030,This projects in this course tested all the knowledge that i had acquired before. The projects were challenging enough and well prepared.,4
90031,Great course!,5
90032,"Nice course, yet more hands on work was expected.",3
90033,Love Dr. Chuck!!!!,5
90034,Thanks,5
90035,Much enjoyable that I expected.,5
90036,A perfect ending!,5
90037,awesome experience :),5
90038,"The Capstone was adequate, but I had hope for a bit more of a challenge. The specialization all together helped me get a better grip on Python Basics.",3
90039,what a great specialization and series of courses... highly recommend!,5
90040,A great finish to the specialization. A very 'free form' approach to the final project allowed students to develop and demonstrate projects in areas that interested them. The instructor (Dr Chuck) is the most engaged and engaging teacher I have come across on Coursera. His live 'graduation' ceremony was a first!,5
90041,I liked reading code for the entirety of this course. I'm glad I went through all the lessons in the series and ended with the capstone course. This course is really helpful because I can see how I can use ideas from this course to work on my own projects.,5
90042,The things that can be built with the skills we developed throughout the specialization are amazing.,5
90043,Thank you very much! :-),5
90044,"The final course in the specialization, we have to learn to use our skills to do projects. Less of coding and more application of knowledge. We can choose to quickly get a certificate or immerse in the experience.",5
90045,Best course to learn python and handling data structures using python.,5
90046,"Excellent course and introduction to processing and visualizing data with Python. Although, most of the code was provided and students only needed to modify and tinker with the scripts, this allowed focusing on the output and visualizations. And having the scripts, the student is free to continue pulling down data and practicing their visualization projects.",5
90047,"For me personally, this is a great closing for this specialization! Thanks Dr. Chuck and his associates!",5
90048,"Thank you, Dr. Chuck, for an amazing course! Thank you, Coursera Team, for an amazing platform to learn!",5
90049,Don't miss the online graduation ceremony!,5
90050,"I suggest to add the option to allow some students write project code on their own, instead of just read and run.",4
90051,I would strongly recommend for those interested in learning python. I will give 100% + rating to Dr Chuck. he is the one of the best teacher i have ever found.,5
90052,"The only thing I had to do in this course regarding the required assignments was to change python 2.7 code to 3.4 as that's what I'm using.Presentations didn't add much towards the learning either. Definite downgrade from previous courses, especially from the first three.",2
90053,One of a kind!,5
90054,"I thought this was poor. It was basically a re-hash of the previous module with slightly different tasks. Given that I had to wait three months for the capstone to be ready, I found it a bit rich that my deadline to finish it was a couple of weeks! Don't waste your money/time on this particular module.",1
90055,Coursework was quite easy. Used a lot of the techniques learned in the other courses. You'll get the most out of this course if you have a data analysis project that you want to do. For us this wasn't required. But doing my own project was the most fun part :),4
90056,I really enjoyed this course. I recommend it to anyone that wants to be challenged to utilize and improve an Architecture with Python.,5
90057,Many thanks to Professor Chuck that put so much effort on this course.,4
90058,Good course for understanding Programming!!!Daler,5
90059,"You are not actually writing any code for this particular course. The assignments are just taking screenshots of running code that is already provided to you in the code repository for this course. The lectures are great, there is a lot to learn from them but the assignments are a total bust. Not worth it for the money, but go for it if you want to complete the entire specialization",3
90060,"good way of explaning all the process from web scraping/mining/crawling to final clean vizualtion,thanks a lot!",5
90061,"Capstone was great, although I would have learnt stuff better if there was a small battle from the deadlines and the curriculum in particular. This was a fun specialization and am looking forward to graduate soon! Thanks Dr. Chuck :)Cheers!",3
90062,"I really didn't learn much. Too much code, too complex, too fast.",3
90063,"As a captstonse course I expected this to be more challenging than other courses in the specialisation, especially the assignments which should have required to put in some real effort rather than simply executing pre-written scripts and uploading screenshots. Rest of the courses in the specialisation were superb, combined with the awesome teaching skills of Dr. Chuck but capstone was quite disappointing unfortunately.",2
90064,I wish it was more hands on.,4
90065,Very few amount of exercise and very small gain of knowledge from Capstone.,2
90066,Love it,5
90067,"It was worth taking just for the code examples and understanding the how to combine multiple process and applications. This course overall was great and provided the right combinations to ensure success such as appropriate timelines, content, and costs.",5
90068,I expected something else.,1
90069,"I am not sure if it was ever stated that there would be no coding, but there wasn't any. In any case, thanks Dr Chuck! :-)",3
90070,I expected more practical exercises. but I did learn some,2
90071,It was such an awesome specialization. It really opened my eyes to a lot of Python :D,5
90072,In this course Dr. Chuck will teach you how to visualize data and work with it.You can't miss it.,5
90073,"The course offers just a simple running of (interesting and useful) code, but doesn't put the student in the situation of thinking and creating ideas and code.",2
90074,"Good professor, great course, great specialization!",5
90075,"thank you ,Dr.chuck",5
90076,"Python for everyone is One of the Best Course on MOOC platform .Dr. Chuck made it interesting and Knowledgeable. Way back 3 Months ,I can't even thing of the stuff that I leaned and implemented .",5
90077,Not much coding to do here - but a lot to understand in terms of getting data - treating it and then using it.Thanks You Dr. Chuck!Will be waiting for further courses from you!,5
90078,5 stars for inspiring gazillion confidence with the exercises3 stars for not pushing us hard during capstoneMean of 4Nah !! Actually 5 Its perfect !,5
90079,"If this entire specialization were a bag of potato chips, the Capstone would be that bland chip that didn't get any salt.The introduction to the Capstone promises that we'll ""build applications"" utilizing what we've learned so far with optional assignments for delving deeper. However, none of the required assignments involve even the most primitive of problem solving skills or code writing abilities. If you can download a file and take a screenshot then you've got what it takes to pass this class.The optional assignments are far too focused around a new piece of video sharing technology that the instructor and associates have developed. Unfortunately, the technology adds almost nothing beneficial to the class and is probably to blame for the sheer lack of quality in the rest of the class.In fact, the entire Capstone feels like it was so haphazardly put together that it can only be described as the most contrived beta-test I've ever been a part of. Such a disappointing ending to what was otherwise an enjoyable specialization.",1
90080,Too easy. :),4
90081,"I enjoyed the course but mostly only because I had ample time to complete it. I likely wouldn't have finished if I was busier. The course notes aren't particularly helpful and they are very brief. The assignments were just okay but most of the time spent on them was trying to debug the code rather than learn the concepts studied in the lectures. I'm giving this course 4 stars, not because the Coursera content was good, it wasn't, but rather because I learned a lot trying to 'figure out' the assignments and finding information online. I'd say if you're a beginner, looking to step into robotics, it might be worth your time but if you're intermediate to advanced, you ought to move along. The content taught versus the time it takes to debug the codes might not be worth your effort.",4
90082,The contents allowed for a good understanding of planning algorithms for robotics purposes,5
90083,The assignments had a lot of ambiguity. The course content was wonderful. It would have been nice if 3d computation problems were involved. Week 4 was really interesting !,3
90084,All the assignments are so unclear and you´ve to lose so much time trying to understand the goal of the problem.,1
90085,"Very useful for robotic beginners, the idea is clear and the explanation is helpful.",5
90086,assignment grading feedback can be made better.,4
90087,"Great Introductory Course. It is a bit short on course content, but teaches you enough to be able to learn from other sources such as research papers, etc.",4
90088,A good course that gives you a brief info on various motion planning methods. A bit more techniques as well as a more complex assignments couldve been put together so that we could understand and implement better.,4
90089,"Very good introduction to motion planning algorithms. The exercises are a bit simple, their descriptions could be more detailed and with more examples and implementations. The grading of some exercises (specially the 4th) is a bit tricky, knowing more about the evaluation conditions would help. Very good course overall, totally recommended!",4
90090,"Great course overall. The automatic grader may not be perfect, but the TA is constantly working on it and he has been clearing up confusion by posting updated PDFs and codes. The discussion forum is awesome. There is plenty of presence of the TA and classmates.It is true that the lectures aren't as long as Aerial Robotics, but they are concise and clear enough for us to work on the assignments. If you are good at matlab and programming, you can breeze through the assignments. If not, you can get stuck for days, like I did.",4
90091,"Quizzes are a little bit harder for my level. And they can help me to improve myself by keeping exploring and trying.However, there is some quiz which I submit many times and I was told that I didn't pass. If you can tell me the reason, I can be more quickly to find out the mistakes.Anyway, it is a good lesson. Thanks a lot!",5
90092,Could be improved. There is more need of involvement of mentors and TAs.,4
90093,"A lot of things to learn,but the programming assignment evaluate program does not help in finding mistakes.",4
90094,A beautiful course for robotics beginners. Videos are mostly conceptual yet superficial while programming assignments give a feel for the technicalities involved.,5
90095,"A good introduction for computational motion planning, and easy to understand.",5
90096,can be much better with little bit of more explanations and more relevant resources for help,3
90097,Best Course for getting an introduction of computational motion planning.,5
90098,"Pretty well. Four-week study gives a general introduction of several motion planning techniques.Programming homework is not so hard, it's great.",5
90099,"It's an excellent course; but I would like that continue and teach about Dynamic planning i.e, Dynamic Obstacles and colaborative robotics.",5
90100,"Easy course, but confusing final assignment.",5
90101,"Could have been awesome course if it discussed some detailed approaches. Only 3 panning approaches discussed in 4 weeks, thus disappointing.",1
90102,"Brilliant course, really enjoyed it",5
90103,"A good and interesting course to get a fundamental understanding of how robots move. Not easy, but quite rewarding for the one who is willing to put some efforts into it.",4
90104,Good course,5
90105,Very practical cours,5
90106,"Not much content covered in course, especially compared to Aerial Robotics. No real great sense of achievement on completion.",3
90107,"Very good course, I wish it had been a little longer.",5
90108,"Excellent course and perspective on mapping paths and routes, anybody planning for this should ensure good knowledge of MatLab, it took me longer to complete the course than I expected due to my lack of familiarity with MatLab.",5
90109,Good Introductory Course but can be better.,4
90110,"A good course to get started with robotic motion planning. It starts from shortest path algorithm, configuration space to probabilistic roadmap and potential filed.",5
90111,Good but can do better.,4
90112,"the fundamental of planning algorithm, basic algorithm: Dijkstra, A*, RRT, artificial potential. Some exercises' requirement should be more detail.",4
90113,"I love this course, I love robotics.",5
90114,Good Introduction to some of the Algorithms in Computational Planning . More of training in assignment than explanation in video,5
90115,"The course is ok, it touches on some interesting topics and it serves its purpose as an introductory course. Unfortunately more interesting topics are only briefly mentioned at the end of the last video. I also think the assignments can be improved, some assignments lack documentation, one of them had a coordinate system swapped from what was shown on screen and the evaluation of some assignments are quite tight, even if you have it working, unless you deliver exactly as it is expected you will fail, not to mention what is expected is sometimes blurry.",3
90116,"It is a great course about Path Planning in robotics, the concepts presented are very usefull",5
90117,"This is just a poor sample of a course. Very few material, low quality assignments and grading.",2
90118,"A great course in a unique topic. It is very well made with a balance of theory in robotics motion control with practical assignments using the popular language Matlab.However, to enjoy this course thoroughly, I think the previous course (Aerial robotics) is very necessary. Also, prior experience with MatLab or a patience to pick up Matlab will be very essential to fare through this course smoothly.",5
90119,"it's a nice to learn a lot from the course. Some of the assignment is quite difficult. But with the discussion forum's help, I can pass all of them.",4
90120,"A great course ,this course will introduce you to the planning algorithms and will make you do some cool stuff as assignments.",5
90121,"The course material is complete, interesting and easy to understand.",5
90122,The last part is a bit boring.Overall I like this course a lot! Thanks!,4
90123,I learned a lot of brilliant techniques in this course. Thank you.,4
90124,"Only for introduction, more materials shoulb be supplied.",3
90125,"I am glad to learn this class, because the teacher is nice and talk the planing method easily.",5
90126,"Good course, completely satisfied. Could have used a bit more material though. For example more tie-ins to the first course would not have been difficult.",5
90127,"The contents and quality of the video lectures are great.The quality of the supplementary materials (like the quizzes and the Matlab code) provided by TAs for the assignments are very poor. The assignment guides are written with very poor grammar. The Matlab code is written using the worst coding and documenting practices. The automatic evaluation system (the system for grade the submissions), doest't provide useful feedback. As people can read in the course discussion forums, students have been asking for months for improvements to the grading systems.",2
90128,"Great course! but there was too little content!!!! Double it !! Or double the coursework! make us do more work! Also, tell people to use 'parfor' to speed up the computations.Otherwise, great course!",3
90129,"First course of this specialization was really GREAT, byt this course disappoints.Of course, there are some interesting topics, but the form of the course is way lazier. Videos are short, there is small amount of additional materials,",3
90130,Great class. For those with lots of programming experience this course is a little too easy.,4
90131,"It's nice! I particularly like the programming homework. However, the course is pretty much beginner-level, and the course is too short (for only 4 weeks).",4
90132,"Interesting material, and good assignments. However this is no assistance when by TAs if you have questions, which is important since there is no feedback on assignments and hard to know where you went wrong.",2
90133,Very good introduction course for motion planning. Could be better if there is more interactions with the TAs. Also the matlab assignments have some minor mistakes which takes time to figure it out.,3
90134,It is only introductory course. not a lot of content.,4
90135,This is very helpful for the students and people working or want to work in aviation/aerial Industry.,5
90136,Very good material and cool assignments.,5
90137,"If the course had the same information and effort as week1 over all 4 weeks i would gave 5 stars, although the assignments are pretty good and I learnt something new, however the assignments are fun but the grader is annoying as the single error output is..... something is wrong... try again?!",1
90138,"The assignments in this course take much more time than indicated. Feedback from staff is minimal. If you are not a good programmer, think twice. Nevertheless, the lectures are interesting and well taught. So if you do not want a certicficate, I recommend this.",2
90139,Great course! I'm really enjoy it. Thanks a lot professor CJ Taylor and staff.,4
90140,"Great course, but I found some problems in assignments formulation and also it would be great if some supplementary material was proposed in order to connect this subject with courses, it might seem sometimes disconnected.",4
90141,"Prof. Taylor's lectures were clear and easy to understand. The course taught the basics of planning pretty well.The teaching staff, unfortunately, was completely unavailable. The solution checkers for the Matlab assignments were very brittle and wasted a lot of students' time. There were several queries about the assignments on the Discussion forums most of which did not elicit any response from the teaching staff. The students ultimately figured it out by spending several laborious hours figuring out the peculiarities of the solution checkers, and by helping each other. This certainly soured my experience with the course.",2
90142,"Very interesting material, but also very light instruction. Requires some MATlab intuition.",3
90143,"The videos are short and to the point, and the Matlab home works are great.",4
90144,This course need a serious rework.For the moment I finished it biggest problem was very unclear grading of programming assignments and lack of learning materials.,1
90145,"The lectures were good, but many assignments had errors (graders, errors in code)",3
90146,Lack of support from course teaching staff in answering student's questions.,1
90147,Taught me many planning algorithms in an easy way.,4
90148,No much staff in it,2
90149,The materials are not deep enough. And the programming assignments are just so-so.,3
90150,"This is the second of the series, and I had high hopes for this one after the first one was a disappointment.While the material was on the sparse side, the level of the course was more as advertised. The Matlab assignments were not too difficult, but were relevant enough to the material to be acceptable. Some of the assignment simulations/animations were not working, but I was able to submit the results and get full credit. I was ready to give 2 or 3 stars in this review.Unfortunately, on the last assignment, the sample code and scripts was buggy (even towards the end of the course after it had been pointed out to the staff), and inconsistently written.The final project submit script would not work and it was a trial and error troubleshooting to understand why. Some on the discussion boards were able to submit, but other couldn't. Although my assignment would run as I understand the project should, I could not even submit it. Judging from the discussion boards, I'm not the only one with this problem.Again, the University of Pennsylvania has missed the mark with this class and the robotics series. It is regretful that I must again leave a one star review.I realize this is the first time this course was offered, so there are some issues that need to be worked out. I suggest for the remainder of the classes in the series, the creators should do a pilot run first before releasing to Coursera.",1
90151,"The course could be 1-week long instead of 4. The material offered is introductory level. Quizes are too easy, programming assignments still have bugs, and grading procedures cause a lot of confusion.",2
90152,Many problems and mistakes found in the assignment programs and I felt a lack of staff assistance on helping solving them.,2
90153,"Assignments were fantastic, course structure was great! Focus was mainly on algorithmic concepts that were then implemented during assignments. Great learning experience. Just that the assignment grading system could have been better.",4
90154,It was a great course!!!,4
90155,"The topic is interesting and the lectures itself were good. The explanations of the algorithms and concepts was clear and easy to understand. However, the amount of material covered is very little. I think there should either be more concepts thought or they should be covered in more depth.Quizzes: The quizzes were very weak. They didn't really tell you weather you understood the concept or not. If one of the answers was wrong there was no information which one it was. So you have no idea which lecture you should watch again.Assignments: The assignments were very bad prepared. In some assignments there were bugs in the provided code, we weren't supposed to edit. The assignments itself are rather easy and can be completed quite quickly, if there wasn't the grader. From the grading you got no information what was wrong or which tests passed or failed. Most of the time it wasn't the case that the algorithm failed, instead the output was not as expected by the grader, although it was as described in the assignment. But you never knew. This part has to be improved a lot.Overall I have to say that I expected much more from University of Pennsylvania, especially after taking the first part of the Specialization which was of good quality.",1
90156,"So I'll start with the positives. The material was appropriate and interesting and well presented. CJ Taylor is an enthusiastic lecturer and the material was presented in an enjoyable easy to understand way and having finished the course, I definitely want to learn more about computational motion planning.The problems I have with this course though are numerous. This is the second part of the Robotics Specialization and compared to the first part, this course was very weak. There was very little lecture material and the course felt thin - as if it were 2 weeks of material stretched over 4. There were many instances where the lectures could have gone in to much more detail and just didn't, I appreciate that you can't cover everything in lectures, but would it have killed you to provide or at least point to some good additional reading resources?The assessments were the worst part. The quizzes barely tested what I had learnt and could mostly be solved by common sense. What I find shocking is that there were so few questions with few multiple choice answer that you could easily brute-force these quizzes if you really wanted to. Compare this to the Aerial Robotics course where the quizzes took time and forced me to think and understand what was discussed in lecture.The programming assignments were shockingly bad. They were hard for completely the wrong reasons. I spent most of my time on them not coding the solution, but trying to figure out what was actually wanted and fixing bugs that were in the provided code that we WEREN'T EVEN SUPPOSED TO EDIT. The autograder would never tell you why you were wrong, just ""I'm sorry, your solution didn't pass all of our test cases."" This meant that finding the solution was based on guesswork rather than considered thought. This was made even worse by the fact that some simulations took a long time to run which made iterating guesses very slow - and doing this on a time limit is just pointlessly stressful.One of the assignments had the solution already in the source code as the instructors had forgotten to take it out.The final assignment wouldn't even run out of the box without fixing bugs in the provided code. This would have taken seconds to check had the person who wrote it bothered to check their work beforehand.Thing is, the tasks provided in principle weren't that hard, they were actually kind of too easy. Dijkstra's algorithm isn't that difficult to implement from scratch, and yet all that was asked of us was to implement a small 10 line for-loop. That said, I appreciate that as a software engineer, I might find this sort of thing much easier than most, but even so I don't feel as though the programming assignments helped me learn anything.Overall, regardless of how interesting the material was, this course was very shoddily put together. I appreciate this is the first time the course has been run, but this really felt phoned in and unacceptable. I paid money for this course and the quality of it is notably worse than most free MOOCs I have taken. I feel ripped off and I sincerely hope that the next section is better otherwise I doubt I will bother to continue until the end. I thought Penn University was better than this.",2
90157,Should letting us do more programming stuff.,4
90158,The first two assignments certainly tested knowledge of the subject however the last two assignmnets were lacking. Good course that does what it is supposed to do. More feedback from test cases would be very helpful.,3
90159,"A great course on Motion Planning for systems, I enjoyed it. I got stuck a few times during assignments, but due to a great community, I was able to pull through and gain a better understand of the course.",4
90160,"Sorry to say that this is not a well prepared course. The course video provided is quite short, the quiz is rather than nothing and the programming assignments are buggy. I don't feel that I learned a lot from this course.UPenn has let me down twice. Hope the 3rd one will be better.",1
90161,"some of the assignments are unclear, need more detail. Over all great course.",4
90162,"Overall decent course.This course focused less on the theory aspects in the course videos, which bothered me a lot considering I am paying for it. But the explanations were still good for those algorithms.The assignments were good as well. I liked how they made us work on them instead of the first course where we were mostly tuning parameters. Hopefully MOOCs start having challenging assignments too.The instructor explained really well too!I didn't really end up visiting the Discussion Forums for this course at all. So can't comment on the participation from other students or TAs.Future Advice -Considering how other courses offer about 1-2 hours of course videos, I think this course could offer a lot more. One assignment problem focusing on one algorithm, while having other challenging algorithms taught in those videos to be left for our own implementation would help students a lot more i believe.",3
90163,Some really good concepts introduced at just the right level.,5
90164,"In this course we will get to know about shortest path algorithm such A*, Dijkstra's, concept of configuration space and path planning in the same, developing Probabilistic road maps and RRT and also a bit about Artificial potenial fields. All the algorithms are neatly explained. The material though very short(in terms of total hours of video lectures) is nicely compiled. The quality of the MATLAB exercises is very good with few issues here and there. We can extract a lot about MATLAB implementation of different simulations by spending time understanding the given code and also implementing missing sections as part of the assignment.Overall, a great course.",4
90165,"Most of the homework assignments aren't graded correctly out of the box and have errors. Also, only specific solutions are selected. Otherwise it's great material at a good pace.",3
90166,Great course but programming assignments in MATLAB had too many issues.,3
90167,"This was an interesting course, however there were bugs and errors in most of the assignment materials, which really impaired the learning experience since much of it was reduced to debugging the course organiser's code... Also the 3rd and fourth sections, including assignments, seemed to be rather small and to cover very little material, with little or no supporting material. Moreover, course staff were conspicuous by their absence on the course forums. A stark contrast to the abundance of support provided and material covered in aerial robotics.",2
90168,"I think there is need to provide clearer instructions on how to get the programming assignments done. The course content is good, but doing the programming assignments needs to be more clarified.",3
90169,I like this course because they are covering really complicated topics in very less material. And the assignments are amazing. They are worth the learning effect they create.,5
90170,"Extremely basic.The assignments would be easy except that the provided code has bugs, and some of the assignment details are wrong, making it very difficult to pass the test cases.There is also very little information on how the work will be graded.",2
90171,The Assignments are more of Trial and Error and not very helpful. The Course Material and Content is good. Teaching Staff is nowhere to be found.,2
90172,"A well-presented, high-level, overview of computational robot planning. Students should understand the basics of how to apply some of the key fundamental techniques when they have completed this course. It should provide a good grounding for future study or research",5
90173,In comparison to the first course this one lacks a lot of organization and debugging before sending it to the public,3
90174,"The material is interesting, however there is not enough information provided by the course to effectively implement the algorithms in the allotted time of each week's assignments. It relies on deferring to external reading materials as primary sources, and these resources were not specified in advance to secure copies in a timely manner.Additionally, there is a big disconnect between the knowledge provided by the weekly material and what is required to easily do the programming assignments in the suggested time of 3 hours.Overall the course material needs to provide more background material to be more effective in delivering the knowledge expected each week. This may be an artifact of trying to cram what other online course provide in 7-10 weeks down into 4 weeks. If the intention is to give a ""flavor"" in 4 weeks, then the material needs to be distilled down into more of a cookbook format.",3
90175,"as an introduction is a really good course. The assignments are interesting and can get you to understand what you are doing.However, the grading system used for the assignment is frustrating.. it is never known what it is actually graded and even if your solution is correct compared to what written in the assignment pdf, most of the times is considered wrong without saying why.",4
90176,I don't have reasons to rate it less but I will recommend that the gap between the course materials and the assignment levels should be bridged.It took significantly more time in course which almost defeated the whole purpose.,5
90177,"Although the course covers interesting subject areas, I feel like the various topics should have been explored to a greater depth. I understand that someone with lesser background in the relevant areas might not agree with me. But overall, I felt slightly underwhelmed by the course.Also, the skeleton of code provided for the assignments had minor errors and the instructions for assignments were sometimes ambiguous or even incorrect as compared to what was actually required of the code. But these minor issues will most likely get resolved in subsequent offerings of the course.",3
90178,The course is so weak. No enough illustration for the content of the course. It's too short and not prepared very well.,1
90179,"This course is good, but maybe it is a little bit to easy and only cover a small part of knowledge. However, I think it's okay for a introduction course. I hope there will be course dig into more deeply and wilder knowledge",5
90180,"The assignments were hard, not because of the contents of the courser, but for understanding the context of the method being implemented (what each variable meant and how it was expressed).Also, there should be a range of submissions that could be right but having higher or lower scores depending of how long it took to find the path, or how long the path was to reach the goal.",2
90181,"I enjoyed this course, and learnt a lot. The only reason I'm not giving it 5/5 is that the programming assignments were a bit too easy, especially the last two.",4
90182,Very interesting module about Motion planning. I really appreciate that this course put a big emphasis on concrete implementation with various programming assignments.,5
90183,"The course is very bad and feels thrown together at the last minute. Learning A* and Dijkstra's algorithm is great however the assignments require you to learn not just the little details but to ""discovery"" techniques not even mentioned in the course material. In addition, you must have strong matlab programming skills and be familiar with much matlab functionality in order to debug some of the assignments. You must have more knowledge concerning matlab than any of the course material or pointers provides. Meaning that beginners will NOT pass this course. The automatic grader provides no feedback at all except pass or fail. This is unfortunate as it can look like your code is working correctly but, the grader is using some edge cases to grade the code but will not include any information indicating what to look for. This is really atrocious. Although the TA's do occasionally provide answers to questions. The total amount of time TA's spend answering questions is just really poor. Don't expect even well asked questions to be answered at all. In addition, the coded template quality upon which your own code depends is horrible and thrown together. You will spend way too much time analyzing it for clues as to what went wrong. Sadly, enough all of these issues have caught up with me and I was unable to pass assignment 2 part 2. Even, though everything looks like it works and achieves the desired goal and even works with all of my own test cases. The grader is merciless. Perhaps, in the feature more time can be devoted to make this course better and I can spend more time learning how the algorithms and maths work rather than matlab and the automatic grader. At this time I don't feel like my money was well spent on these courses. I don't think I would like to risk another 50 dollars learning matlab and debugging the automatic grader on any of the other courses in this specialization. That is very disappointing as I really am passionate about learning robotics and looked forward to the other courses as well.",1
90184,Damn good!! and bit difficult,4
90185,"Everything was so relevant and finely explained, but It clearly wasn't a beginner's course, it's more an Intermediate Course.",5
90186,"I think that the theory was very poor in sense of the videos were very short and with little content. The topics that we've seen were difficult to learn by itself, and a better explanation could be very useful in practice.",3
90187,Very well balanced course for introductory one.,5
90188,"Feedback is useless, but content is fine.",3
90189,Absolutely awesome. It's fun learning.,5
90190,"This is part 2 in the robotics specialization. The course content is way too short and basic for the price. There are about 77 minutes of lecture in total, i.e. less than 20 minutes per week. The first week covers BFS, Dijkstra, and A*, something part of most undergrad programs. The rest of the material is ok but very basic. The programming assignments are ""implement Dijkstra"" in week 1, ""implement Dijkstra on a Torus"" (and ""do triangles intersect?"") in week 2, a very simple for loop in week 3, and ""implement gradient descent"" in week 4. I could complete the course by looking at it on-and-off over one weekend.The material that is presented is presented well, but there's not enough of it.For reference, part 1 of the robotics specialization had over twice as much lecture content (by time) and then lots of supplementary material in addition to that, quizzes that required some thinking, and more relevant and at least slightly harder programming assignments.",1
90191,"The assignment code is ambiguous and the assignment is not clear! The lecture is not much helpful than I thought it would be. Overall, I would not recommend this course if you don't need the certificate.",1
90192,The fastest approach to robot motion planning---from someone who knows nothing about the subject.,5
90193,"Very poor teaching. Extremely difficult to decipher what is important and will be tested, and what is not. They assume that you know terminology and concepts that are not taught. Half of what they show, you are told to ignore. Obviously smart and capable researchers, but teaching the lay person is not their strong point.",1
90194,This course was exceptional helpful for my thesis research preparation and completion. :),5
90195,"The course is useful. Help everybody who want to design a questionnaire. The course content an overview about methodological issues, measurement errors as a consequence of skip some considerations in design the questions or the mode chosen. The project of the course, which you have to draft a questionnaire speed up the learning process. In general, the course delivery what it is promise.",5
90196,It can't be more complete. My favorite course yet taken.,5
90197,Very detailed and comprehensive module.,5
90198,very knowledgeable course it opened the door to my further study thanks a lot our professors for your hard work .,5
90199,"Clear, practical videos accompanied by quality reading material.",5
90200,"Easy to understand, and lots of practical considerations and instructions for designing your surveys.",5
90201,Good course. Useful for research students.,4
90202,This is a thorough course on Questionnaire Design. I have found it very rewarding for those who are interested in research knowledge. After completing this part of the course I am left wanting to attempt at least some of the other parts particularly those dealing with data analysis and hopefully learn about soft ware that might be available as an aid to data analysis. I recommend the course to those who desire to approach their research assignments in a more scientific way.By way of a general comment I would suggest that course material and examples be as internationally representative as possible. some of the presentations assume that participants understand the American social developments and the research preoccupations.,4
90203,So much material! The presentations are engaging and well-paced. The presenters showed an appropriate level of candor about the behavior of both respondents and interviewers.,5
90204,Great course!,5
90205,Not quite what I expected. More on the role of the interviewer than the actual design of questionnaires.,3
90206,"I am in the process of applying for a PhD that will entail developing a questionnaire de novo, and this brief course has been immeasurably helpful in identifying components of questionnaire design that require careful consideration. It is only a taster, and there is certainly a lot more to read up on around the topic, but it has provided a sound basis to grow on. I would highly recommend it for anyone who is new to survey methodology, or is even slightly interested in knowing how the design of surveys can influence results.",5
90207,"Excellent, I really enjoyed it!",5
90208,"It would be very useful for teachers, teacher-trainers etc. They must go for this course.",4
90209,Could be more practical.,4
90210,Great course understand research method and design!,4
90211,"Well structured, clear and easy to understand.",5
90212,it is pretty good,5
90213,Very useful.,4
90214,A well thought course on the composition of items. The main strength is that it is supported both by the expertise of the speakers and academic literature.,4
90215,"Readings were not necessary for the course and quizzes were extremely difficult, seeming to be worded in an attempt to stump students, and many questions were not from the course lessons. Videos very dry and boring.",2
90216,"Very well structured course, with thoughtful and sensible quiz reviews.",5
90217,"Pros: Excellent material, great that slides are available for downloadCons: The videos are much too long and have too much detail that could just be added as footnotes in the slides.",4
90218,"The material is useful, but the execution is poor. There were numerous quiz questions that I think they just had coded wrong on their end. I think they need to carefully look at the questions with the most incorrect answers and ask themselves if they've made a mistake. Also, this might be the first time they've tried making a peer-reviewed project part of the course, but they did a poor job. They made it a homework assignment for week 2, but didn't make it clear that it wasn't due until the end of the course, even though Coursera sends you emails saying it's due soon. This caused a great deal of confusion. Some of the required readings also had broken links. It's odd nobody on their end checked those the week the material was taught. They do provide a lot of useful supplemental material (though often pay-walled).",2
90219,Interesting course! Thank you for the instructors. I will definitely try some other courses by these authors and University of Michigan.,5
90220,"This is a great course, very interesting and helpful.",5
90221,Great course!,5
90222,An excellent course that covers the fundamental concepts for survey design and administration. The content was well structured and presentations and study material was rich and comprehensive.,5
90223,"a really charming teaching staff , a highly applicable metholodgy",5
90224,Very good course! I learned much more than what I expected! It is also great help for my psychology course and project.,5
90225,"Very helpful. But could be more interactive, more activities to do. Maybe include peer assessed tasks where we can create good questionnaire items by each topic. Lecturers are like frozen - no or very little emotions.",4
90226,"excellent course, I found it really useful and stimulating",5
90227,"I thoroughly enjoyed this course. It was a narrowly-defined topic (Questionnaire Design) that was well-explored; this makes the course feel like you are actually learning something and does not feel overwhelming in the slightest. You feel you are actually learning a skill rather than a subject. Further, the professors were clear in their teaching methods.",5
90228,It is very good course! I can apply to my Ph.D research.,5
90229,Very useful insights on actual questionnaire creation.,5
90230,Very useful course for research purposes. Thanks!,5
90231,"This course was very engaging.The reading materials took time to complete, but were essential to fully grasp the video lectures. I have already been able to apply some of these teachings to an unrelated field! Very enjoyable and rewarding. Thank you!",5
90232,Very helpful and interesting course!!!!,5
90233,"The material is a bit dry, but it's essential to writing effective survey questions. The course is well designed and easy to follow. Thanks to the University of Michigan and the University of Maryland for offering this interesting course. I hope to see additional offerings in survey research methods from these professors in the future.",4
90234,There should be more than just lectures. I find the overall content to be very exciting but at times the lectures get a little boring and monotonous maybe.,3
90235,Bad quality slides and presentation. not possible to use headphone since it was on mono not stereo. Interesting topic but not well executed to fit online learning,1
90236,"very informative course, covers several aspects of questionnaires. Many examples are provided although references are a bit old but i suppose that they are seminal research works.",4
90237,topic is interesting however the lecturers not quite lively,1
90238,"the instructor voice are so calm , so i cannot concentrate well",1
90239,Excellent Course! Great tutors and material.,5
90240,Great course. The instructors could have gone a bit slow during the session on multiple regression.,4
90241,"great course , a must for all science students",5
90242,"Very clear and documented videos, ability to choose between two différents statistical software: python and sas",5
90243,Background Sound is awesome haha,5
90244,easy to follow,5
90245,This is a great beginner level course for those have no programming experience. But I would suggest the content to be extended to 8 weeks instead of 4 weeks.,4
90246,"This was a great course. I've done a few in the area of stats, regression and machine learning now and the Wesleyan ones are the most well-rounded of all of them",5
90247,"The course content is very well-designed and to be honest, it doesn't go very deep into the statistical details and i completed the whole course within just a week. Still, it lays a good groundwork for future studies. Don't expect to be a data specialist after this course, but it definitely teaches you all the basic knowledge(Multiple regression, Logistic regression, examine model fit using q-q plot, standardized residuals and multiple diagnostic plots) you can start to implement to analyze your own data. And of course, if you are interested in all these topics and want to expand your knowledge, this course prepares you to furthure your studies. Great course! And I will sure recommend it to my friends with or without a statistical back ground.",5
90248,Assignmetns allow student to choose dataset and analysis - but are not very well structured.Detailed exaplanations.,4
90249,great effort was paid preparing this course .,4
90250,simple and useful,4
90251,Extremely boring and not,1
90252,Good Course. To the point and clean lectures.,4
90253,"Similar to other courses in this specialization, the material is very nice (although slightly easy and straightforward), but the course instructors do not moderate the discussions enough to make them a useful tool. Especially when I'm paying for the specialization, I would appreciate responses to my questions.",1
90254,"I think you will get a lot out of this course/specialisation if you don't expect to be spoon-fed. I have seen comments here stating that only one dataset is used per course, not covering all the other options available. This is because you are supposed to understand the concepts presented to you and apply them to your own set and ideas.The same in terms of grading: you should know whether your code throws up mistakes, how to fix those and whether your conclusions make sense.It's preparation for the real world: the onus is on you to seek alternative sources of help at time (like stackflow), to correct your mistakes, to understand whether the result makes sense. Your classmates are only there to keep you to the deadline. In real life no-one will hold your hand.Concepts are explained very well, I am finding it easy to complete two courses simultaneously quite quickly. Great specialisation.",5
90255,The course was very shallow as if teaching english literature,1
90256,I really like this training. It's good if you want a good view of applied regression.,5
90257,"There is a lot of self-teaching with these courses because there are no professors present to reach out to with questions. In addition, the course staff do not always respond promptly nor are they fully knowledgeable about all aspects of error messages that may arise out of coding. At times the code that were provided in the lecture videos were out of date and a lot of time was spent on googling to find the updated code. This is definitely not a beginner coder course and I do not recommend it to anyone who has not coded before.",3
90258,"I learned a few things. The videos were good. The feedback from the student reviews was erratic. There was some good, thoughtful feedback and some was nonsense. I took the free option. I don't think I'd ever pay for a course where evaluations are conducted by people who understand the material no better than I do.This is the second course in this series that I completed. I also finished the machine learning course. I think I'm done with this specialization.",2
90259,Great but too much stock video footage of people smoking.,5
90260,Good for understanding concepts and running code in SAS but still needs more depth to the coursework.,4
90261,"The course contents are unfortunately very poorly designed, and this has been an ongoing trend in this overall specialization.The weekly lecture videos are at times quite unclear and leave more questions unanswered than they answer. I (and other learners) have found glaring gaps in the course content again and again. The examples that the lecture videos use do not nearly cover the variety of datasets being used by the learners in the course; and the least that could have been done is to at least inform learners of what to expect if they were dealing with a different research question and using an alternate dataset.I know the defense may be that the videos are meant to be introductory / gateway to a deeper understanding of that particular topic. The course moderators / instructors did a terrible job in keeping up with answering key questions that were posted in the discussion board. Yet most of the times when I was still searching for answers, looking up similar introductory videos in Youtube were far more helpful (and I didn't have to pay to watch them).The assignments are poorly worded because the instructions are not always very clear, which in my opinion set up a lot of learners including myself for failure. The lectures are often broader than what should be considered when finishing the weekly assignment. It wasn't even clear at times of what was exactly being expected in the assignment. The rubric that I had to use to mark my peers' work meant their analysis had gaps because the criteria for assessment is not transparent AT ALL during the submission of an assignment (they are starkly different in terms of details).All to say that I have been quite frustrated despite my best efforts to learn from these materials and much MUCH more can be done to improve the actual content of the lectures.Please consider adding alternate resources AS WELL where learners can go seek the right answers if the answer is not provided by the lecture materials. This can help to cut back on countless precious hours for those who are juggling a full-time job and retraining / career change like I am, not to mention the countless other scenarios of other learners out there.I am neither inattentive nor lazy, and learning this content is very important to me, if it wasn't clear through my comments here already.One last comment, for those of you who are all very sceptical let me tell you that I know that I don't have to be a statistician to grade the course contents, and I really hope the intructors are paying attention to these and similar comments from those enrolled in this specialization and the others who have completed the course.",1
90262,Awesome course. Thanks Prof. I am expecting more courses.,5
90263,too easy,1
90264,"I would do it again, even if there was no tutor support in discussion forums it teaches the arguments very good.",5
90265,I truly enjoyed this course and I learned a lot. I particularly liked the structure and setup. My suggestions for improvement would be to provide more background information and further reading on the subjects covered and to maybe have a handout that summarizes the most important concepts and key messages of each week.,4
90266,Very nice lecture videos and explanations! Totally worth it,5
90267,"As with all Coursera courses, there is no way to communicate with the tutors, which is vey important in such a specialised course. The course also requires finishing assignments while needed clarification and explanation is not always provided in the course videos. in some assignment a required step was only explained in the following week (Centering variables).Assignments review depend only on peer review, when peers in most of the time don't read through assignment completely or open attachments leading to poor grading based on 'missed information' that are actually attached in submissions.Also this course along with the rest of the courses in the Data Analysis and Interpretation need some more focus on using SAS and other data analysis tools and the way to present results in a more appealing way. (this could be given one extra lecture in each course).",2
90268,"This was another strong course from Wesleyan, and well produced. However some of the weekly problems were vague and it was not clear exactly what was being sought or how they would be evaluated, as they have been very clear in the previous mini courses in this specialization.",4
90269,I enjoy this course so far. I like how the course entirely depends on peer grading. It will help us to get some honest feedback on our research.,5
90270,This is the only course on SAS(structured) available for free till date,5
90271,Could be more clear about how to calculate period and latency.,2
90272,"Great lectures and format. The content was quiet complicated, especially the math proofs, but they make it easy to skip over the tough parts. It's a great way to learn how to think critically and logically about all sorts of systems.",5
90273,"The videos are sometimes interesting, but explanations would have been clearer if there are documents provided as visual aids.",4
90274,"A very good course in general. The materials and assignments are practical and the explanation of the instructors are clear. You are expect to gain a general knowledge about computer vision, camera calibration, and the usage of linear algebra in computer vision.One thing that could be improved is that there is a big jump from week 2 to week 3 and also from week 3 to week 4. It's like a sophomore course at week 1 and week 2 and suddenly it jumps to a senior course in week 3 and a graduate course in week 4. It might be better to provide some supplementary materials in between.",4
90275,Too much theory and projects didn't related with real life problems.,3
90276,"Loved the lecture and materials. However, the course need more ACTIVE teaching staff and mentors. I had several questions regarding the materials but could not get any help from start to the end. It was the only specialization course that I had to move on without complete understanding of the materials.",4
90277,Really good course for getting a sound foundation on geometry of computer vision.,5
90278,The 4th week content is hard to follow than the previous three. It would be better if more detailed math and examples are provided in the 4th week.,4
90279,Unclear explaination,4
90280,"Interesting material, presented well, very on-top and supportive TAs. I wish the second assignment had been the first assignment (the current first assignment is very basic and can be scrapped), so that the 4th assignment could be about implementing bundle adjustment.",5
90281,"This course is excellent: lots of things covered in depth, learning curve is high, detailed explanations with lots of examples; If you want to ramp up quickly on Structure for Motion or Visual Odometry, Visual SLAM, this is highly recommended. But be prepared to put some real effort in this demanding course. Overall one of the best MOOC I took. Programming assignments and especially the last one are *very* interesting. It's great to have such courses that are available for everybody. Pre-requisites are linear algebra (eigenvalues, eigenvectors, Jacobian, Hessian ...) and familiarity with matlab (but people familiar with numpy should easily ramp up). For people not familiar with matlab there are also some very nice matlab tutorials in the resources. Highly recommended.",5
90282,"very good, I love this course, I learned many knowledge from it",5
90283,Great course!,5
90284,"Very useful course, interesting topics !",5
90285,"Lots of good content, good explanations, and good pictures to explain things. I enjoyed the assignments too",4
90286,"Sloppy, unorganized, and poorly presented. Try the similar class on EdX and YouTube for a much better and clear explanation and presentation.",1
90287,Awesome material! I think this is the one course of the specialization that had the appropriate amount of work for the timeline.,5
90288,"This is the -hands down- best course within the Robotics Specialization. It is educating as well as entertaining (well, as far as a mooc about robotic perception can be, but I loved it!) and you will learn A LOT, if you don't give up and try hard. Because this course is not easy at all. Its not for beginner and sometimes I had the impression that its neither for people with a somewhat intermediate level of engineering and/or mathematical understanding. I struggled about 40 hours with the final project, but in the end I managed to finish successfully! Thanks to the staff for this very cool learning experience!",5
90289,"very informative. the course is very demanding, due to very long lectures it is hard to stay in pace.",4
90290,"The course has a good structure. It covers interesting themas. The assignments are easy to understand. It takes more effort than 3 or 5 hours/week, the nomenclatur could be improved to be consistent. A couple of more examples would improve learning. The four week was hard ;)",4
90291,"Good intro course for someone has no prior knowledge in Computer Vision. The entire course is about linear algebra practices. Professors provide lots of information, assignment projects are interesting.",5
90292,The courses are good and helpful.,4
90293,"Good course, but assignmets are too long, difficult and with no much help. Workload is overpassed",4
90294,"Good course, lecturers do their best to give u an informative course",5
90295,The content is very good but the lecture presentation and structure could use improvement. Assignment instructions are not as clear as they could be.,2
90296,"A BRILLIANT, BRILLIANT COURSE, the teachers put A LOT of effort into making the lecture slides and videos. Everything was explained multiple times such that the student understands it better. Also, computer vision, especially geometric vision is difficult to understand without a proper background in linear algebra, but the teachers' explanation was enough to fill the gaps so that even someone with only a minimalistic knowledge of linear algebra was able to consume the content.The exercises were a class apart, they were very well structured with tangible results at the end of each, And each of the exercises brought together the key points of the lectures, so that the student could easily implement them in code and test out the algorithm.Last but the not the least, the community was very active with the teaching assistants pitching in wherever necessary, in particular, Stephen did a great job of understanding the issues students were facing and taking appropriate action.All in All, a very well structured course to jump start one's career into computer vision.",5
90297,"The videos should be completely reconsidered. Instructors pointing at virtual points on screen does not help at all. The course creators tried to squeeze in many concepts in 4 weeks. More examples should be provided in lectures, not just abstract math (e.g. lectures on projective transformation).",2
90298,"This course is great! There is a lot of information available, a wide range of topics are covered, some complex subjects are explained quite well and especially the Chinese professor makes it easy to understand them.Still, there is room for improvement. Considering this is a 4-week course and the coverage of the material, sometimes it feels too squeezed and cramped together. This could be improved by providing access to more references to other materials to complement the studies. A bibliography for instance would be much welcome.Also there are some annoying typos in the slides in the formulas and its derivations that can cost you some precious time to figure out, especially during the Matlab assignments.These are the only reasons I don't give this course 5 stars, but it's definitely worthwhile. You will not regret it!",4
90299,"Lots of cutting edge mathematical and computer vision concepts, but a serious lack of support. No technical staff around to help, only one or two examples of how the math works, and a general poor explanation of the concepts.This course is not for beginners, and I recommend you steer clear if you do not posses at minimum a bachelors in mathematics.",2
90300,Great!,5
90301,"Excellent course, very nice field of research with a lot of space for innovation.",5
90302,"It is certainly the most comprehensive course in computer vision that can be provided in a span of four weeks. It is much time consuming compared to the other four courses (I have done this at the end); however, each and every bit of it is worth it. The teaching is incredible, especially, Prof. Shi's teaching includes intuition and physical interpretation which helps in appreciating the equations much more. The assignments equally match with the lecture content. Trust me, by the end of four weeks you will be comfortable in reading and understanding papers in visual SLAM, pose estimation, etc.A small suggestion: in a few lectures, for instance in SIFT lecture, Prof. Daniilidis is not shown in the screen whereas his actions are necessary to better understand the content in the slides.The Professors and the TAs have done a commendable job and thank you all for this course.",5
90303,The lecture notes should be better organized.,4
90304,It is great. Teacher explain those idea clearly,5
90305,Love the course.,5
90306,"As a standalone course - incredible. Lots of content, in detailed guides through maths. You seem to have been structural, but I still go lost every time. Overall impression is very chaotic. Maybe more summaries could help. Also separating videos into 'guide through maths' and ' guide through reasoning/theory/motivation' could helpAs a part of specialization: This course has more content than the previous 3 courses combined. This took me by surprise and it actually took me 3 months to finish this course. Maybe you could saparate some stuff to optional and required?",5
90307,very good assignment!,5
90308,"Excellent organization and presentation of the course material, and very prompt responses from the teaching staff on the message boards.",5
90309,Very good course. The only thing that I would suggest is an higher precence of moderators in the forum. It would be very appreciated.,5
90310,"I really loved the dense collection of relevant information, this course is a great introduction to computer vision-related algorithms.Unfortunately the lecture videos are poorly edited and subtitles are inaccurate, however the slides are quite good and verbose enough to understand every topic.Assignments are quite good, however formula derivation explanations could be better.",3
90311,"The course is a very good overall description of the Perception field. The part I really liked is that there was no haste or a concept just superficially discussed - lectures are long and detailed. The presentation of lectures especially from Prof. Jianbo Shi are excellent - to represent Matrices in colours and give a intuitive sense of every formula(especially the Jacobians and treating the image blending process as painting) .The bad part of this course is that pronunciations of faculties could be a little unclear and hence a very good transcript is required - which in this course is not upto the mark. There were few mistakes on the slides and should be rectified atleast in the pdf of the slides. What this means is that we have to go through some frustration while watching the video first time which gradually improves on second or third view. Also, there is absolutely no participation of teaching staff. A good content should be supplemented with assistance to further enhance learning experience. Few doubts because of this remains unclear and I wish I could have got this sorted in this class.",3
90312,The assignments and weekly work is by far much more than the hours estimated. Finally I feel as I didn't learn anything.,1
90313,"This course should have been very good. Lots of detail. But the material is not presented very clearly. The Assignments are also not setup so that it is easy to fix your work. It either passes, or you get minimal feedback.",2
90314,"This course has a lot of interesting material regarding perception using cameras. The lectures focus on a wide range of topics, from the basics until camera pose estimation, epipolar geometry, optical flow and 3D motion. The explanations are very clear, and the Jacobian explanation using colors is excellent.Negative points: sometimes the lectures are long, and the concepts are a little bit mixed.",4
90315,"I dont like how this course was presented. The professors are good but the way how they present the course is extremely inefficient. I mean, because the instructor only speaks moving hands from one side to other, it was very difficult to visualize what and where the instructor was referencing to. Eg. a figure with 3 formulas and many variables there was no way to know in what alpha variable in formulas the instructor was talking about, once all formulas had the alpha variable. Also, when trying to describe a 3D environment only moving hands, its quite impossible to determine what and where the instructor is. One suggestion to try to minimize this problem would be try to use a lase pointer or a stick or a pen or something similar to help the student to now where the instructor exactly is. One example of good presentation is the course of ML from Andrew Ng where he writes all the things while speaking which facilitates the student to follow the sequence. Hope this can help.",3
90316,Solid Material as an introductory course and gives glimpse on the new horizons on computer vision.,5
90317,Very good. Teachers worked hard. Practical and quite comprehensive for such short term.,5
90318,"Very solid material, a must-have course.",5
90319,The least comprehensive course I ever took. It needs very good prerequisite about computer vision. And the demostration was very poor.,1
90320,"Professors very hard to understand, and videos don't have the best editing.Also extremely math heavy, lectures being just math formulas, without a lot of real life applicability (ex. the assignments where you have to project a logo, or cube, when the program gives you the location corners in a file, which will NEVER happen when you use your camera; finding that position is a pre-requisite of the entire program)",2
90321,The videos are so long in time and not very clear.,3
90322,Lessons and videos are very long for one week.,3
90323,"So many interesting concepts and theories, packed in a 4 week course.Excellent.",5
90324,Excellent course ! well presented and relevant material.,5
90325,Good tips provided to make sure nothing has been forgotten in your research process.,4
90326,tres bon,5
90327,Very good MOOC. I have learned a lot Thanks,5
90328,Excellent course for those who want a better way to see life and how to make decisions.,5
90329,"Hubiera sido genial que se puedan dar los exámenes, y ya el pago por el certificado aparte. - It will be really great that you can make the quizz and get your results without paying, because you will not get the verified certify.",2
90330,This is just an excellent course. I'm truly improving my solving-problems skills. Thanks for dedicated your valuable time to us.,5
90331,"The speaker isn't very good, he speaks looking at his monitor all the time while he is reading the slides. I am not very happy about this course, I think it could be better if subjects would be deeper.",2
90332,Very useful information,5
90333,Excelent course and teachers!! Congratulations!!,5
90334,I will never look at advertising with the same eyes. It made me understand a lot of our current society and economy. Really suggested if you want to become a more informed citizen and consumer.,5
90335,very nice and very effective course :),5
90336,its Resource full and informative,4
90337,"Interesting topics, but not taught in the most interesting way. The professor answered in his lecture videos some of my basic questions about advertising, but I don't think that he made the class very exciting and I didn't feel motivated to seek out outside material. I'm glad I took this course, but I don't think that I would recommend it to many other people.",3
90338,"Loved the course, loved the subject...thank you very much...",5
90339,"The course is much better than my expectation, and the flexibility in the quiz and deadline is much supportive. The content of the course is widely sourced. One should do this whoever want to the the evolution of the advertisement world.",4
90340,It has been a very informative and interesting course.,5
90341,"it's helpful but not interactive a lot, sometimes hard to follow the video but the proffessor is quite knowledged about the history, gives a lot of insights and force you to re-assess the course after it finishes , by na",4
90342,it is a wonderful course!,5
90343,It is amazing!,5
90344,"My first course about advertising ever, it was very interesting and the knowledge i learned, i'm sure gonna be useful! Thank you very much!",5
90345,Takes you back to the age old version of ad pieces from cave paintings to todays social madness. A complete guide to a better student of advertising. And the 80% cross mark challenging and motivating. Thanks for this.,4
90346,"Absolutely fantastic course! Great insights and, of course, great teacher!",5
90347,Great course! It has helped me learn a lot and given me much more perspective on the world of advertising. I thoroughly enjoyed learning and discovering new things.,5
90348,"This course looks at advertising from a different angle which is very interesting and inspiring.you will learn a lot, i highly recommend it to everyone in the marketing realm.",5
90349,best one yet!,5
90350,"This course is a solid bookend in preparation for the Capstone Course. The processes and exercises for closing a project are very often overlooked or under-emphasized in the professional world. This course presents great tools and exercises that can not only close a project on a high note, but indeed even improve a work environment in general.",5
90351,"Pretty good course, although could have been a bit more exhaustive",4
90352,awesome course!,5
90353,This course is really very Helpful.,5
90354,"Good course ,Great Sessions , course rightly packed for working people.",5
90355,"There was some nice content, but not practical enoough",3
90356,very good content on how to measure and improve processes and products,5
90357,Too high level,2
90358,A lot of objective approaches for monitoring and improving projects!,5
90359,Very interesting and helpful. Monitoring and reviewing made simple,5
90360,Very good course,5
90361,"Very good, but I wish for more analysis of what self-destructive metrics mean and how to handle them (who own the metric, etc)",4
90362,"I found the concepts beeing presented ""generalized"" - and not as dedicated to specific SPM scenario's.",5
90363,"Good material, but even better external material shown by links to blogs or related stuff.Too focused in SCRUM. Maybe other methodologies are worth to explain.I'll not buy it since I'm a SM, but if you are beginning with this topics or want to pursue a SM certificate, this course definitively can help you.",4
90364,Pretty good course for Product Managers with respect to the review & metrics - with agile and scrum as the methodology,5
90365,Great techniques on metrics!,5
90366,"Metrics produced a great opportunity to use exercises creating the software metric artifacts, as was done so well in course #4. This would be a significant improvement, and the lack of it was the only reason this didn't get five stars.",4
90367,Great course. You will make your software better and your team stronger.,5
90368,Great course to learn all about tracking progress in your software project,4
90369,A great finish to a great specialization. VERY HIGHLY recommend.,5
90370,"It's a great course! Highly practical guide on how to develop the right product, done right, and managed right.",5
90371,Great insight into how to track and review metrics!,5
90372,All was super,5
90373,This is a great course for leading the development team but it's very theoretical.It is better to add videos from real-world meetings.,4
90374,Maybe it would be better to add more exercises to assimilate better the content. Same as previous courses in the Specialization.,4
90375,"Should include recent material. A reference book from 2001 is very out of date, especially in the software world.",3
90376,It is one of the more practical courses of the specialization,5
90377,very useful course :),5
90378,Good Course.,4
90379,I liked this course very much,5
90380,More assignments would help reinforce learning,3
90381,Way too shallow and way too english :(,2
90382,"All my projects, in terms of productivity and quality, have improved by simply applying various aspects of what I have learnt from this specialization.",5
90383,"Everthing is interesting about this specialisation, this is my fifth coruse and I am so glad that I have invested my time in this.",5
90384,"Reviews and metrics not only useful for a team, but it's also important he helpful for personal. When you set up a goal for yourself how to review and improve ? This course helps me to learn at 2 levels: team and person.",5
90385,All courses of this specialisation are great!,5
90386,Very nice content and presented so nicely. Must read and highly recommended course for all managers and business analysts.,4
90387,Excellent course. Great examples and easy to understand concepts.,5
90388,Enjoyed alot,5
90389,Good course,5
90390,"My favorite course in the degree, so far! I started applying what I learned immediately. This course should be mandatory for any data analyst, as the concepts are applicable no matter which language or tools are used.",5
90391,"Great course with good case studies and clearcut goals - learn knitr, markdown, and a little history of literate programming languages. The importance of making Reproducible Research is ineffable. But, reproducible research won't do anything if the analysis is wrong- this is covered in data pipeline lectures in week 3.",5
90392,Very important topic to improve science.,5
90393,Very interesting course,5
90394,good course,4
90395,Great course! Starting to put pieces from earlier courses together into a whole.,4
90396,very helpful,5
90397,Great perspective of how to do science!,5
90398,I think this not a complicated course but is absolutely fundamentals of proper scientific principles which are so often lacking in many data science/analytics projects.,5
90399,I found this course very informative and helpful. The course content is very well organized.,5
90400,The course is very informative.,4
90401,"If you are at university (PhD student, academic, researcher, etc.) then you kind of know most of the ""theory"". However, practising R was a huge plus (personally, I liked the Week 4 task).",4
90402,"decent course, it is as long as you make it but start the final project early",4
90403,This course was very helpful for my career,5
90404,Good intro to the topic,5
90405,"Reproducible research with doubt is important but videos and what it is discuss are not appealing and beyond that, what are worthen are the projects. I did not learn so much from the videos but by myself. Though, the forum is very useful.",2
90406,"Everyone should know this, every thing should have prove and balance",5
90407,A great course which might not draw the right attention while moving towards a data scientist role. But without a great deal of focus on the communication of analysis is even more important to gain buy-ins within or outside the org. Will keep them in mind.,5
90408,"Thank you, my teacher",4
90409,"I think this topic is sometimes overlooked, but very necessary. This course did a good job of covering the topic.",5
90410,I think it is one of the easiest and most important courses in Data science.,4
90411,One of my favourites. The course is easy to follow and the idea of having a self-contained and reproducible document is very powerful.,5
90412,"This was possibly the most important class I took, which was completely unexpected.",5
90413,Good course. Especially enjoyed final course project. It's really challenging and looks like a real‑life task.,4
90414,I found this course is really important and good. Most valuable takeaway is making you think about other people who will look / challenge or derive your analysis. Looking at work you are doing from this perspective lets you keep things in order and stay as transparent as possible.,5
90415,"I have learned a lot in this course, for me more important than any tool or technical skill it was the idea of reproducible research, which can be used in many other process. Anyone who has been in a deputy position or replacing someone else at work can easily understand the importance of making things reproducible.",4
90416,"I had difficultly with the two assignments, not because they were difficult but because the instructions were not clear. From reviewing other's assignments, it did not appear to be just me.",3
90417,Important topic to cover....Nice course,3
90418,"This course makes us re-think things that we take for granted. I was shocked in the beginnig on how we ignore practices that should be the basics of any research. As the course progress, I learned new concepts what is essential to our self development.",5
90419,Good course as part of the data science specialization. Much effort needed for assignments in contrast to this relative light topic.,4
90420,2 Thumbs Up.,5
90421,"While I'm pretty sure this course is VERY important for researchers, it is not very useful for my area (IT) and I would like to know this before taking the course. Thank you.",4
90422,Sholdnt be a different course. It shold be very very concise. Not this long.,2
90423,"This course was not so convient for me as other Data Science Courses. Therefore it even seems easy than the rest of speciality I was not able to get to the end until first assignment has been moved to the 2nd week. But starting and leaving it for few times I got so needed experience with report preparation, reseach process description and converting all the steps of my study into a story, which could be understandable for someone else. Thanks everyone! I enjoy my new skills and sell them for good price!",5
90424,This should be a mandatory course.,5
90425,Great course. Make you think like a scientist.,5
90426,Could have more content in deep,4
90427,Provides a very summary overview of a very important aspect of data analysis. Expected more!,2
90428,"The concept is very important, so it's good that this course is available. The video's are sometimes not that great of quality. It's okay to show recordings of lectures, but the sound is of less quality.Another thing is that the teacher says a lot of ""euhm"". I know he cannot help that, but once you notice this it becomes a bit annoying.",4
90429,I found all the topics of this course important. Not only for my professional career but also for everyone who is involved with data and science in general.,5
90430,This is a very good course for a begineer like me.,5
90431,"This course has changed my way to look at everyday's work. Not only with respect to the explaination to others of your work, why you take an approach compared to another, what is the sequence of your data cleaning and processing etc. It is especially useful to avoid the pain of re-learning by ourselves what we learned 6 months, one year, two years ago. Great course, one of the best of the specialization.",5
90432,latex is better :O,4
90433,All in all a great course with very valuable information to make a data scientist better at his job. However it could have been covered in 2 weeks time,4
90434,Learnt some really neat new tools. Favourite course from this specialisation so far.,5
90435,Whilst I can see why the idea of reproducible research is important there was't really enough material in this course for the full four weeks - and in fact a lot of the videos repeated the same information.,1
90436,Very good class!,5
90437,You will learn how to use a very valuable tool in this class; its name is R Markdown. Besides Prof. Peng explains very well the importance of reproducible research. Nice course!,4
90438,Excellent course! I highly recommend it.,5
90439,"excellent course, specially all the topics related to markdown, rpubs. A must for each data scientist.",5
90440,best course so far in the data scienist course package!,5
90441,Very good course. Would love to get to see examples of some advanced usage of knitr in developing presentations and complex reports.,4
90442,quite redondant with what was done before but very usefull and clear course,4
90443,Great class. It helps frame all that you will do as a Data Scientist. Building blocks. Peng nails it.,5
90444,"Besides the ""real"" scientists like medicine or bioscience, I think the whole community would be better off it everybody would follow the principles laid out here: Do your analysis but make sure that others can follow the rationale and that your steps are documented and thus reproducible.",4
90445,Awesome course. Must to have!!!,5
90446,Excellent content and plan. The delivery is fantastic and the professor's explanatory clarity is top notch. I highly recommend this course.,5
90447,"Reproducibility of results is a cornerstone of the scientific method. Full reproduction is not always practical, but in 2016 it should almost always be possible to present the computations behind research so that others may retrace and validate the steps taken. Professor Peng is a thought leader in this idea and provides a well-designed introductory course in ""Reproducible Research"".",5
90448,"This course seems 'light' in content - too much time is spent reviewing case studies instead of discussing different ways to create documents that enable reproducible research. Perhaps this should be a topic/chapter in another course, and not a standalone course.",2
90449,"This was a great course, it proves the value of reproducible research. Case in point, the lecture on where cancer trials were cancelled due to analysis results. This trial withdrawal undoubtedly helped people, either by saving lives or at the vary least not aggravating their condition.",5
90450,"Great course. A must for every analyst for its simple tips on reproducibility, which can go a very very long way at work or school",5
90451,"In my opinion, this is one of the most valuable courses in the Data Science Specialization. The principles of tidy data and reproducible research are critical and this course makes an excellent presentation of both. I have only just completed the course and have already begun using what I learned in my professional life.",5
90452,"Good lesson, about an interesting topic for me.",5
90453,This was very useful.,5
90454,"This course helped me realize why reproducible research is absolutely necessary, and gave me the tools to implement reproducibility in my work. Project was great.",5
90455,Coding documents and data cleaning is possibly the best thing ever =D,5
90456,"Great Course, should be free to all freshman graduate students across the world.",5
90457,nice learn about the graph,5
90458,This course has contents that are repeated multiple times throughout the course. I think entire course could have been covered in a week or at most two weeks.,3
90459,This course helped me very much with my current career.,5
90460,"Interesting material, but wasn't necessarily of the same depth of knowledge like previous courses in the series",3
90461,"Impressed. Great, great, course.Enjoy and learn at the same time.",5
90462,Add polish.,5
90463,"Great course to learn ""knitr"" and how to code in reproducible manner!Totally recommend it!",5
90464,That's the best course of the entire specialisation.,3
90465,"Not a well structured course. Also, not very motivating to go through this one.",3
90466,"My name is Jose Antonio from Brazil. I am looking for a new Data Scientist career.Please, take a look at my LinkedIn profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseantonio11I did this course to get new knowledge about Data Science and better understand the technology and your practical applications.The course was excellent and the classes well taught by teachers.Congratulations to Coursera team and Instructors.",5
90467,Nice course on reproducible research!,5
90468,"It is not a bad course, but it is very little informative. There is some nice general discussions about data science by the teacher, there is the explanation of the package knitr, and little else.As part of the data science specialization it is nice. As a stand-alone course, I would definitely not recommend it.",2
90469,This is an excellent course which teaches you fundamental best practices in research. After completion you will look back at early scripts in horror! It's unfortunate that the practices you learn aren't more widely practiced.,5
90470,It is about how to make your work available for others and yourself in the future. It is quite refreshing because I have never heard about anything in this course from anywhere else. It is useful for me and hope it will be useful to you.,4
90471,Could have been covered in 1-2 weeks.,4
90472,I struggled in getting the final project right but it helped me understand the course better. Thumbs up reproducible research,5
90473,"Very useful material, and great use for presenting data analysis results.",4
90474,Some of the material seems pretty rote but it did introduce some new software and capabilities.,4
90475,Very useful course,5
90476,Great,5
90477,Material was very interesting and I learned a lot,4
90478,This course had a profound impact on the procedures I use for data analysis. It provides best practices for documenting the steps of the analysis to ensure accuracy and quality. I highly recommend taking this.,5
90479,Slightly less information than the previous courses in DS spec but important for someone who has not done scientific research in the past.,5
90480,Very well prepared and explained.,5
90481,foundamental. well done,5
90482,This course was very important for my work. I learned so much and I want to say thanks to the professors.,5
90483,"Pretty good course that introduces a lot of useful tools and the concept of reproduciblity. However, it is not quite as applicable as the previous courses for those who are individual contributors in the private sector and rarely have others double check their analyses or need to publish anything.",4
90484,Good but not that deep. This should be in 2 weeks.,4
90485,"The course already needs and actualization, plus they must fix the order of the first assignment. Besides that, this is a really useful and fulfilling course.",4
90486,"Has interesting ideas and approach to forming a structure way of analysing a problem. The module does feel a little thin in content, and perhaps should be combined with Exploratory Analysis.",3
90487,content is not enough for one class. should be only one to two videos.,3
90488,This was really valuable in terms of how to document correctly and produce reproducable reports.,5
90489,"Course content is okay - there was some repetition of topics throughout the weeks. As the other first courses in the specialization, students would benefit tremendously if the instructors were a bit more active - the course feels out of date and abandoned.",3
90490,Great and Excellent thoughts and course material.,5
90491,"An informative course that will teach you the paradigm of reproducible research, this is very important in Data Science.You'll learn how to write a data science report using R markdown. That's not the most important thing though. The most important thing is knowing how to start your research and what to do with the data to come up with valuable insights. That process includes getting and cleaning data, manipulation, processing of data, analyzing the data and drawing inference from results.Great course for people who are looking to be serious data scientist! Rigor and thorough, this is a very good introduction to report writing in R.",5
90492,Great course! I learned a lot. Thx.,5
90493,Why is this its own class? Seems like it could have been covered in a week somewhere else.,3
90494,Great course. Learn new amazing stuff.,4
90495,learned some very valuable tools for,5
90496,"This was another very useful course in the series, with (peer reviewed) assignments taking on a very significant role.",4
90497,This is a very useful course,5
90498,Wonderful course on research principles and the creation of reproducible R reports with knitr.,5
90499,Rather general topic,4
90500,It gives a live to research. Nice course.,5
90501,it shows how to better communicate one analysis and i have learnt a lot from it. the lectures should be updated as some details and figures were irrelevant a this time,4
90502,"This course presented a very useful challenge in terms of data analysis. In one of the projects we're given a data-set that doesn't show straight up what to do with it, even with a clear set of instructions. And this is something common in terms of data analysis that everyone eventually faces with. This isn't the kind of difficult in terms of technicality, but still took me a couple of times to complete because of the maturity and independence needed to just ""tackle"" the data. I highly recommend it.",5
90503,Great introduction to reproducibility.,5
90504,"Too expensive for the material it provides; it is helpful and necessary but this course can be summarised in 1-2 lectures. There is a very good lecture from an external speaker,which was very good and funny (at least i found it funny) and i didn't realise that it was 30 mins long.",3
90505,This has been a great introductory course into reproducible research. The topics were clearly carefully chosen and wisely integrated to create a smooth flow. Money well spent and invaluable knowledge gained!,5
90506,I think this is an essential course that more people should take. Reproducibility is a huge issue in many fields.,5
90507,This would be very effective for my personal skill enhancement.,4
90508,good course. I will recommend it for everyone.,5
90509,excellent course to introduce practical approach for reporting data analysis !,5
90510,"1 for Knitr, otherwise it's waste of time.",1
90511,Awesome Course !!,5
90512,Too expensive for such a simple course,1
90513,"Very good, but maybe not at solid as those before it. Some reproducibility concepts felt a bit vague.",4
90514,Good learning,5
90515,Excellently designed course! I loved how the course content and assignments were designed and delivered.,5
90516,Week1 and Week2 should be swapped I guess.,4
90517,"The course was good. I enjoyed it. The biggest problem was the un-moderated participation of at least one other student. This particular student drove the discussion of assignments, leaving little room for others to explore, ask, and answer questions. As far as I know the student was not a mentor/TA, but It would have been most helpful for staff to weigh in on some of the student's post. I really believe the student was feeding his/her ego.",3
90518,"Course is generall very good and lots of fun!2 things i would change:... the Assignment 1 is too early in the course or the Lectures are disordered, but I needed the second and third week material to do the first weeks assignment.... Add Jupyter Notebooks in the Specialization in addition to Knit-R",3
90519,great Course !,5
90520,Overall I found this course useful. My only complaint is that the material needed to complete the first assignment in week 1 came in week 2.,4
90521,"This turned out to be one of the more fun courses, especially listening to Rogers lecture ""live in class room"" and also the case presented by M.D. Anderson was great. I really enjoyed this course, even more than I initially expected to.",5
90522,This course helped me to apply skills learned in the other courses of the specialization.,5
90523,Loved it. The concepts around reproducible research are important. Should be mandatory teaching in school.,5
90524,Completely irrelevant material.,1
90525,"I've already written a review but it seems to have been removed...This is an awful course, there is very little purpose to it whatsoever, it is basically a module in markdown which will in all honesty not have much application for most learners.In addition, the course is not at all balanced / laid out well, there is a peer assignment in week 1, which you need to have covered week 2's content for.Lastly, the recording quality of some of the lectures is awful, it is clear that they have simply used some recordings of an actual classroom session of a related course instead of recording for Coursera.In all honesty, this entire specialisation is of awful quality, it is not a data science course, it is a ""here's a few useful things in R"" course, and the instructors should be ashamed that their institution makes money from it.",1
90526,Great course!! Go GO RPENG!!,5
90527,"Seems like the course lectures are out of order or duplicated. In order for us the complete the first project, it required us to view Week 2 videos as well. I wish this was noted/told to the students in the course.",2
90528,The first assignment should occur during the second week instead of the first given how the material is presented. The second and final project is very time consuming. Ideally this course should run for 6 weeks instead of 4 because of this. The second project is challenging and it definitely drives home the point about reproducible result given the state of the raw data.,4
90529,Very well organized course materials.,5
90530,Instructor not as good. A big fail when you need the 2nd lesson in order to complete the 1st programming assignment.,2
90531,The content is good but the contents have a lot of overlap. The instructors are definitely knowledgeble about the material and clear about the presentation but a lot of the same matierial are repeated throughout the course unintentionally. Think the insturctors just thought it was enough to throw a bunch of things together and called it the day.,3
90532,I felt this course could have been added as sections to other courses. One separate course for this topic is a waste of money.,1
90533,This is a great course that teaches students about the importance of reproducibility for research and data analyses. It provides tools that help a scientist to thoroughly document and publish their research in a fully reproducible way and it shows the current best practices for reproducibility.All the course content is very clearly explained and the assignments help reinforce the students' learning process.,5
90534,"Excellent course that is both well presented and very clear, providing many examples and opportunities to practice throughout the course.",5
90535,"By far the most time consuming, yet rewarding course in the data science specialization thus far. Literate Programing in general and R Markdown in particular are simple enough as concepts, but do take some time to grow accustomed to. However, I found the course to be a compelling argument for reproducibility that has application beyond just Data Science proper.Although the technology is completely different, the concepts behind reproducibility really resonated with me and the work I do managing a division in Application Development. I'm constantly having to balance seemingly limitless demands, limited resources, and the difficulty of retaining staff in highly-competitive industry. Reproducibility becomes not just the basis for cross-training, product stabilization, and growth, but is a necessary ingredient of a team's survival.This course not only cemented my own thoughts on the topic, but gave me some new ideas and tools for process improvement on the job.",4
90536,One of the best courses in this specialization.,5
90537,"Very pragmatic course, tremendously useful not just for research but also for commercial projects.",5
90538,"It is a nice introduction to some important issues in scientific research, may not be so intresting to non academic data scientist hopefuls, but it is very important, I think to those that are within academia.",5
90539,"It's, for sure, a necessary content but don't feel like something that deserves to be on this specialization. Content is good.",3
90540,"Practical, and well paced.",5
90541,The course is poorly organised: There is a project on week one that requires knowledges of week two. Some concepts are dictated more than once because it uses videos made for this course + other recorded from a class room.I think this course should be a 3 weeks project and the price should be the half of it cost.Though I enjoyed the second project.,2
90542,This class's R markdown material taught me to efficiently convey and market data analysis to non-specialists of data. It was immediately valuable to my career.,5
90543,Good to know the principles here. Thanks.,4
90544,Very helpful.,5
90545,"In this course, there was a slide presentation with audio recorded in a classroom. This part of the course should be replaced as soon as possible to offer better experience. As it is presented right now, with a loudy environment, it really doesn't match to the quality of the other courses.",4
90546,Great course !!,5
90547,Still i can used easily.,4
90548,Week1 can be explained better. First assignment i was clueleass on Kintr and how to generate report.,3
90549,One of the most useful classes so far!Provides great foundation for creating quality reports!,5
90550,Excellent course with great didactic. Congratulations!,5
90551,"My favorite course, at least it gives me an argument why scripted statistics is awesome and can be applied to a number of data related activities. Recycling chunks of code has proven useful to me.",5
90552,Thank you son much!!!!I really like the course.It help me in my job =),5
90553,great one to know how about researches are done,5
90554,The first week assignment should really be the second week assignment since all the lessons about knitr would have made the assignment much easier.,3
90555,a very important part of data analysis. I especially found the case study in week 4 to be of tremendous interest highlighting the real world applications.,5
90556,"Great class with excellent supporting material. A little chaotic, but very good overall.",4
90557,First week has an assignment that requires knowledge from the second week. It would be better for the course if both assignments has two weeks for accomplishment.,4
90558,Some videos have bad audio quality.,5
90559,"To be honest, I couldn't realize why this had to be an entire seminar on its own. Apart from that, in some videos the audio quality was rather poor and the instructor seemed to have caught some cold or something. Although the topic of the course is interesting and significant, I think that do far it is the least engaging of the specialization...",3
90560,"Great Course, Learned a lot",5
90561,"Very helpful, let me know new tools like knitr and Rmarkdown language!",5
90562,"First I've been thinking that the topic is not so important to create a whole course for it, but after watching it and trying some of the technics mentioned here I found that the quality of my analysis increased , also now I spend much less time trying to organise my scripts, data and findings. Thanks!",5
90563,"The other modules that I have done in this specialisation have been great. The lecturers are insightful and the courses have been at the right pace. This particular module was flat, to say the least. I paid €43 to learn a small amount of markdown syntax, and the quizzes and the weeks didn't even match up!",1
90564,"Some of the videos has low quality, which make them harder to understand for non native speakers. In my opinion there is also too less tips for second assessment.",3
90565,Covers some important and interesting areas and is generally well taught (although the recording quality on the videos varies). Interesting final project!,4
90566,"Compact, informative and practical",4
90567,Very interesting,5
90568,"Overall a good course for self-study. The assignments in particular are excellent for data cleaning, analysis and interpretation. The quizzes are very basic though and appear to be there only to check if the student has gone through the lectures. The knowledge needed to answer the quizzes and achieve the desired results in the assignments are vastly different and should be addressed.The case studies at the end are insightful and more use could be made of them in a more advanced course. There is a lot of repetition of concepts throughout the course and this can become distracting. THe format for the lecture videos varies throughout and this inconsistency (along with extreme audio volume changes) also becomes distracting.Other than that, excellent for driving the need for reproducible research (RR) home, presenting and explaining some tools available to achieve RR and ways of publishing results/reports from these studies.",3
90569,"Very helpful content for new teachers, presented in an engaging manner, and concisely.",5
90570,Definitely learned plenty of tips that will give me a leg up when I start teaching.,5
90571,"Excellent for teachers who've been at it awhile, too. I will recommend this course to my peers.",5
90572,It requires you to use a lot of personal information - I did not do well on a peer graded assignment because I didn't give out enough information about what my teaching level is. I fail to see how it is relevant to learning the course and do not feel comfortable volunteering the amount of information many other people do.,2
90573,"A good MOOC, but i was also hoping to see how to make solid lectures for class.",4
90574,They cover the three tips well and use classroom footage to demonstrate the points. (It would be nice if the classrooms didn't look staged though.),4
90575,"Even if you're a rookie teacher, the course turns you into a student first! Excellent material and teaching, but it seems specially geared toward K-12.",4
90576,I love this course and the way the insights are presented. Thank you.,4
90577,This course should be taken by EVERY 1st year teacher once they are in the classroom or before they step into their own classroom. I'm positive that this course will help you and will guide you through some of the toughest situations. I really appreciate the fact that they encourage scripting and practicing the toughest things like giving consequences. I will definitely use the tools that they taught me in my second year and to be a more effective teacher. TWO THUMBS UP!,5
90578,"Some parts were very useful. Some parts looked useful, but when I tried it in practice, it was almost impossible to do for me. The course wants to make you behave like a machine, for a part of your job. So you have more room in your head to behave the way you want to. But behaving like a machine, I tried, but I can not. Still there are very usefull parts in this course. I did about 4/5 of the course.",3
90579,I liked the course very much. Its great and helpful.,5
90580,"In getting feedback from my peer review which I am very open to feedback however, I guess I did not appreciate being told what I should or shouldn't do in my classroom with my kids. I appreciate suggestions for improvement but, I felt that more critique was on my teaching style than my writing. Again I appreciate feedback, but unless in my classroom with my kids and doing something I have done numerous times at the request of my own principal I did not thin it was fair. Also, as a teacher there is never just one way of doing things there is always multiple ways and being told to do it one way, there way was not appropriate at least for me so, this course although very",1
90581,Excellent course! It have improved my performance at classroom by 150% :),5
90582,This course taught me some new concepts and gave me insight into best practice and working faster and smarter.,5
90583,"Excellent course! Very good videos, and useful reading materials. Nothing to complain about. I look forward to being involved in more of Match's MOOCs. Thank you!",5
90584,Amazing course,5
90585,"I love the way Match teaches everything with goofy mnemonics that stick. Their curriculum has helped turn around my classroom teaching. They totally understand how hard the first year is, and are empathetic with their suggestions. I appreciate the examples, both the serious and goofy one. I'd recommend this to all teachers.",5
90586,Very useful for beginning teachers -- will focus you on three areas of great improvement and growth!,5
90587,great mission！,5
90588,Very interesting the way the videos are made.,5
90589,Course director is fantastic and course materials is easily immediately applicable,5
90590,"Easy to follow with lots of get tips, even for experienced teachers. Really enjoyed it and have implemented strategies I learned in the course, which are already showing results. Thank you!",5
90591,"I took this course because I wanted to implement some changes in my teaching practice. I'm not a rookie teacher anymore, but this course provides some very accurate information and landmarks, and encouraged me a lot. As I am working, the effort is worth it, and perfectly sized : no overload. I could experiment with my own students and implement changes that had very positive impact on their practice. It was a way to practice english too... Thank you very much, I enjoyed being a rookie again and felt that many new things could still happen in this tiring but challenging job.",5
90592,This is a great course which provides a deep insight into teaching strategies not only for rookie teachers but for experienced ones as well. Thank you for your work!,5
90593,I like the course.,5
90594,Short and basic but great.,5
90595,Pretty practical course It' ll involve a good amount of programming. Not quiz and theoretical verification here.,4
90596,Leanring of mechanism and implementation of Kalman filter and particle filter from experiment is very interesting for me. And these method let me know more about map building in SLAM framework.,5
90597,"Here I learnt all the building blocks of Probabilistic Robotics and the significance of statistical methods etc to deal with the the non-linear world.The course content is very concise and to the point. And, the knowledge transferred is well structured.",5
90598,It make me to know more!,5
90599,very minimal presentation of many concepts!,3
90600,"The material is clearly presented. The Matlab exercises complement and reinforce the subject, the level of difficulty is well balanced, thanks for this great course.",5
90601,"What's there is ok, but there is only a few minutes of lecture material each week.",2
90602,"It's a great course. Although the assignment is little tough, you will gain a lot after completing it.",5
90603,Not deeply explained not for beginneer.,3
90604,"Everything is good,but the assignments are a little hard,haha",4
90605,"When I took, assignments 2 and 4 were broken and there were no mentors to help students. However, I am now told they will be fixing the course. I give 2 stars becuase the concepts of the assignments is good, but the course needs more attention.",2
90606,"Week 1 and Week 3 are organized much better than Week 2 and Week 4. If you don't have enough time, I recommend that you focus on Week 1 and 3.",4
90607,it was a good course,4
90608,Really nice course with a lot of good content.,5
90609,need more lectures. there are complicated topics with weak background for the students.except that it is a great course. thanks..,3
90610,"I wouldn't recommend this course to my worst enemy. There is 0 commitment from the TA and mentor staff. After 4 weeks of course, not a single reply from any of them in the forums.To make matters worse, the material is very superficial and lacking, the biggest proof of that is that each module is composed of about 4 videos of 5 minutes each! How can you learn anything in 5 minutes? The topics are so complex, there is simply no way to convey their message in just about 5 minutes. I had to search a lot outside of this course to grasp something of the topics covered. Actually, I found way better explained videos on youtube for free.The assignments of this course are poorly developed and don't reflect what is discussed in the videos well. I repeat myself, the study material was very lacking and consequently not enough for the assignments themselves. I had to spend days coding, debugging and reverse engineering the assignment files to finally be able to pass because they were wrong! They were incomplete and had wrong information. This is not a reverse engineering course... I shouldn't need to do that. Anyway, I did it because there was also no help from any TA to guide me in the right direction.Long story short, you are way better off checking the syllabus of this course and checking videos on youtube to learn about them, you'll learn way more than with this money grabber course.",1
90611,"more mathematical depth would be great, videos are too concise",4
90612,Very good and informative.,5
90613,week 2 and week4 should be improved because of some ambiguities,5
90614,"This course is very useful and interesting, but the materials of week 2 & 4 is enough for their quizs.",3
90615,Highly recommended!!,5
90616,"Barely any contents in the course. Only a few minutes of lectures, no quizzes and poorly constructed assignments that waste a lot of time. Weeks 2 and 4 have the worst material I've seen in all the courses I've taken until today.",1
90617,"Lesson 1 and Lesson 3 are clear. However, homework in Lesson 2 and Lesson 4 is hard to finish because of too few materials in the lesson. Overall, it is a fairly good course.",4
90618,Course contents are very short and to the point. I thought weeks on Gaussian Model Learning and Robot Mapping were neat. But the other two weeks on Kalman filter and Particle Localization were little disappointing. They could have discussed both these topics properly by investing more time. Couple of Assignments are tough and there will be very little help to complete it but nevertheless it will keep you interested in the course.,3
90619,A tough course with few hours of lecture material and some good programming assignments.You will be satisfied by those assignments however .,5
90620,This is course is really helpful for beginners to understand how probability is useful in Robotics.Assignments are bit tough but worth the time .,5
90621,Poor structuring of assignments. Unclear objectives and wrong input data.Course Content was good.,3
90622,You need to have deep knowledge in matlab to get pass the assignments. I have spent more time figuring out how the simulations are implemented that really learning about the target algorithm to implement.,1
90623,"Contents relevant, lectures well paced and clear and TA's very helpful and on it!",5
90624,"Great content but dome speakers really need to be more involved... Some videos are perfect if you want to sleep...Also there was some mistakes in the programming assignments (more or less fixed now) and maybe a bit more details or example code would help. It was hard to make the assignments without extra help and many students had difficulties finding what to do, hopefully the forum was a real life saving tool.The MATLAB introduction is just ridiculous: you'll need 10x more knowledge of it to do the assignments. it's like taking your first driving lesson on Monday and do Indianapolis 500 on Tuesday...For someone like me that was not very familiar with this tool, I spend 90% of the time googling ""matlab doing this or that"" to find example code and making the code work instead of working on the algorithm itself.The tutorial in the Aerial Robotics is more complete.",4
90625,"Very important materials are explained super briefly. I would only suggest it for getting familiar with the estimation ""keywords and terminologies"" or for someone who wants to brush up his/her prior knowledge in estimation. The total session time for all 4 weeks together is only a few hours and the homeworks do not cover the session topics.",2
90626,"A lot of things to improve, specially thr learning courve is from 1 to 100 and a lot of pre knowledge need, your future public is the hobby robotics people who want to expand their knowledge, a litlle more weeks maybe two can increase the likes for the course. Check this one Control of Mobile Robots you can get an example of a good learning curve",1
90627,It is not very clear. The assignments have several problems with the given code. There are many things to improve in the next sessions.,2
90628,The assignment is meaningless. lack of instructions.,1
90629,Good intro to Kalman filters.,4
90630,"Who teaching us is a student, and the assignment is not in detail as other class",3
90631,Really too short.,3
90632,Very useful and informative course covering key aspects to be taken while writing resumes...,5
90633,"It is an excellent course. Anyone who is new or old to the current job market must consider taking it. I will highly recommend since I learned new strategy and insight into how to write Resumes, Cover Letter and Follow-Up letter and most importantly what I shouldn't do to jeopardize my chances of success. I may revisit other areas as time permits.. Thank You.",5
90634,helpful!!,5
90635,"Excellent, It was concise but without missing details, It also included a lot of examples. Thank You.",5
90636,One of the most compelling and amazing courses on Coursera. Teaches you the essentials required to survive in the 'market'.,5
90637,Informative and practical.,5
90638,"Extremelly clearifying. The directions are comprehensible, and the course helped me to increase the job opportunities dramatically!",5
90639,Very helpful insights and great examples!,5
90640,"good course, but need to pay for tests",3
90641,Practical and usefu,5
90642,"Every time one hear if you are not getting an interview call then it means your resume writing skills are not excellent, you are not able to project your self, you are not able sell your self or you might be overqualified / under-qualified. If you ask them for help, 90% are not in a position to guide you, 9% would support you, provide some reasons, but you still you feel handicap. I am lucky to find my 1% who hold my hand and walked me through each stage , educated me with the explanation why to write like this way in 21st century.In my view it is the right time everyone must gain this skill of 21st century resume and cover letter writing . We need to overwrite now, the old traditional way of resume and cover letter writing.Thanks to Charles Duquette and Daniela C. Wagner-Loera for making this excellent course easy to understand.",5
90643,"I really liked this course because it is very specific, shows very good examples and provides practical resources.",5
90644,"i have learnt a lot in this course. I have changed towards what i thought i knew about my body. This course empowered me to achieve what i want. I couldnt have done it by myself without your help, truthfully it would have taken me months or years to complete this work. I would like to believe that everyone who was on this course gained something, for i did i hope you did too. Many thanks to those who came up with this course, God bless and stay blessed always.",5
90645,"Course is not hard, the lectures are great. Hope can increase some classes or Add some content associated with assisted reproduction",5
90646,Thank you for this course. It would be really wonderful if you have subtitles in different languages because medical terms sometimes are really difficult.,5
90647,Thank you for giving me excellent information on reproduction. It is very helpful course for me. Thank you Northwestern University and coursera.,5
90648,A great course for anyone who wants to refresh or polish their knowledge on basics of human reproduction.,5
90649,Was expecting more videos than readings.,3
90650,Great course to take if you have anything to do with women's health in your practice.,5
90651,Great way to know about the reproductive system,4
90652,very very good course,5
90653,"Good as a very simple overview. This is more high school level than college level... but if that is what you are looking for, then worth the small investment of time and effort it will take.",4
90654,It's a good course. Provides some very important information about reproductive health. Young adolescent men and women should take this course before beginning their sexual life.,4
90655,I really liked the availability to read through notes and word for word of what the videos were talking about. I like the use of pictures as well!,5
90656,Great Presentation and excellent instructor,5
90657,"I have done the first 2 parts and I am half way through the 3rd and I am finding some of the information to be inaccurate. According to the NHS in the UK condom failure rate is 2%, not 15% as stated in this course. It also seems to put a bit too much emphasis on Abstinence. I would recommend every one taking this course to do some further research into contraception and find out more accurate information.",3
90658,"I've learned a lot! Not only the course is imparted by a professional on the field, it also contains lots of supplementary material and further information. Highly recommendable!",5
90659,The lectures should be longer and more detailed.,3
90660,"Amazing course! When I decided to take this course I thought it was going to be one of those ""Mickey Mouse"" type that is all fluff and no substance....NOPE!! Put on your thinking caps and get ready to learn.",5
90661,Awesome experience.,5
90662,Too easy,3
90663,it gives a nice and lovely topics that shoud be known by every coubles and partners to start a healthy family,4
90664,The course is very helpful for those who have very limited time on their hand. I wish videos were longer since I prefer to listen more than to read. You need some background on the reproductive system in order to fully understand it.,3
90665,The most amzing course I've taken yet ! Video lectures are extremely well made ! Beautiful design ! Very very professional !,5
90666,Just boring lectures.After 30 minutes I was finish with the course.The course is very superficial. The instructor also speaks to fast. Sounds like she just read a text trough.,1
90667,It's nice course but a little bit boring.,3
90668,very borring and too simple,2
90669,Good Course!,5
90670,Thank you very much.,5
90671,Great delivery!,4
90672,"I love this course, I keep on taking it over and over again as much as I possibly can.I always learn something different and new.Thanks ; )",5
90673,Excellent course from which I learnt so much. I could not stop viewing the videos and keenly followed the history of the Rolling Stones from the early 60s to the early 70s. I wish I had taken this course years ago. Kudos to the instructor and the teaching staff. You have another satisfied customer.,5
90674,Excellent teacher very expert in the matter,5
90675,interesting and fun,5
90676,"John Covach is one of the best I have ever had. I have taken 4 of his courses and enjoyed every one of them! I would also address the fact that the lack of music (due to licensing) is probably the best option. I believe that most people that take these courses are fans of the subject if not only the genre. That being said, 'we' know the music. I honestly believe it would weigh the course down. Keep up the great work John!",5
90677,"Although not a Rolling Stones fan, I've taken this course in order to discover the series of fortunate happenings and great ideas that turned this band into one of the greatest projects the music industry ever produced. I've learned a lot and I am thankful for that.",5
90678,"Mr. Covach is a very dynamic instructor. He entertains while educating. This is the third course I have taken where he is the instructor. I look forward to his ""Music of The Beatles"" course, which I will soon be enroll",5
90679,Excellent and very informative course. A well presented view of why the Stones are a Major impact on music of the Rock and Roll Era.,5
90680,"Very complete course, always focused on the music of the band, its influences and achievements. Love it!",5
90681,Lots of fun.,5
90682,There is a glitch in the week 2 quiz but otherwise I am very much enjoying the course.,4
90683,I learned so much! Excellent professor!,5
90684,Thank you for this course. The Rolling Stones is not very famous band in my country (Russia),5
90685,Great curse! Good information for lovers of rock 'n roll and fans of the world's greatest rock band!,5
90686,The Best Course for beginners to start.....,5
90687,Well I liked the course untile the last assignment. It says you need 3 hours for this assignment but I could finish it after two days (and I am good in programming). The last assignment is not really well designed specially the trajectory part. The rest of the course was good.,3
90688,"I learned a lot. This is a tough course, quizes are not trivial and the last HW was a huge amount of work. The videos are excellent. The professor goes slow, the visual aides are great and there are several impressive videos of drones doing impressive cool stuff. Only downside is that I would say it's harder than advertised. Also, there are some red herrings disguised as hints in the HW write ups that you have to be careful of before going down unnecessary rabbit holes.",4
90689,It is really an amazing course. I learned a lot! I will now be using the knowledge I gained here to do my thesis. Thank you Dr. Kumar! Thank you UPenn. Thank you coursera for giving me the chance to have this course.,5
90690,thanks for this fantastic course,5
90691,"Very well prepared, clear lectures and doable assignments which are the same time challenging.The only minus is that it is too hard, if possible, to contact the TAs.",4
90692,A brilliant course and very interesting course. Very well taught! The combination of fundamentals and matlab exercises are just right (although cannot help to thinking that there must be a better way to choose Kp and Kv than what I ended up doing .. trial & error ... you will know what I talk about if you take the course! ;-).,5
90693,I am now at the 3rd week of this course. The lectures and supplementary materials helped me a lot to have a proper understanding on the mathematics behind the quad-rotor's motion control. I look forward to complete the course and practice more onto Matlab.,5
90694,Great course. Brilliant for introduction to the field of aerial robotics and helpful for learning about use and application of drones.,4
90695,"would of liked to see more programming examples in the lectures. But all in all, fun course!",3
90696,"This is a good course, and you get an overview of a lot of interesting topics. However, as you advance further in the course, some of the math begins to lose consistency, while some of it just gets skipped.",3
90697,it is so awesome course,4
90698,"The material is very informative and generally well presented. I would have liked more video explanation about the minimum snap trajectories as this was a large part of the final assignment.If the Matlab resource was an actual desktop application instead of online, the assignments would have been much easier and quicker to accomplish. Matlab online, in my experience, is slow and hard to work with in a single browser window.Overall, I enjoyed this course.",4
90699,I think it was one of the best course that I have attended. I am looking forward to the next course.,5
90700,"The course was very useful, but the study material had several printing mistakes in formulae/ derivations that caused problems for some learners. Luckily there were more experienced people around to help, but the course organisers should be more careful in their material. Also, it would help if free software like octave is used rather than matlab.....it was a nightmare to download and install on my ubuntu computer and i still get annoying telephone calls from matlab people asking me if i'm interested in buying the full version.",4
90701,Great course,5
90702,Fantastic course. I have never been able to understand controls so well.,5
90703,"Very informative, but the coding elements can be somewhat difficult mainly because there's not many specific examples provided. It is still a very enlightening course. PS You definitely need to at the very least be very familiar with Differential Equations to take this.",3
90704,"I had problems with lots of small inconsistencies in notations...I prefer courses which are mathematically more precise, and develop the material more systematically.",3
90705,Assignments should be much more clear in terms of what is expected from the students and how to approach the problem.,2
90706,"I think this is very good course of aerial robotics research. Being a student of robotics, I feel that some of stuffs in this course needs a good background in control and mechanical engineering.",5
90707,"since there is a lot of math involved, there should be some carefully written readings. (not only slides or phd thesis)",1
90708,"This course is great. The only thing I'd say is that the prerequisite for this course is really high, much higher than the course is advertised as, and I spent reviewing concepts in linear algebra (for example) almost more or as much as I did spending time on understanding how things work in aerial robotics. Challenging, and I still feel like I barely understand the material (most examples cover the most simple scenarios) so this is really just an introduction. However, still very difficult but recommended. Thanks everyone who put this course together.",5
90709,"Very poor and a complete lack of interaction from Mentors/Tutors. Learners are left behind shooting bullets at the sky hoping to hit a star that might fall over with some hints. The course materials is consistent and very well informed but, as mentioned mentors/tutors since course began never showed up to clarify some frequent issues with Matlab codes and input data.Felt disappointed!!!",2
90710,"[I am speaking from my personal experience about this course. I don't mean to insult anyone or criticize the method of teaching and I am not doubting the credentials of instructors. It is just what I experienced from this course that I am saying. However, I don't mean to discourage anyone from attempting this course. This review is just a summary of what I felt about the first two weeks of this course.]I don't think this course is for the beginners at all. The teaching method did not quite please me. It appears that the instructors and TAs are simply reading the transcripts and bombarding equations on the screen. Also, the course hasn't made any reading material available, and they are not even providing the slides for the lectures (as of till DEC 2016).I have enrolled and completed a course on mobile robotics from Georgia Tech on Coursera and they were using slides and at the same time the instructors were scribbling equations on the slides and ensuring that they maintain synchronicity with the learning and showing them how a particular equation emerges. They also had lectures which were designed to help learners attempt the quiz and special section about MATLAB and how to build robots. They also provided slides to revise what was mentioned in the lectures. They were teaching and not reading from teleprompter.This course looked lot of theoretical and I am not sure for whom it is designed for. Also, in the discussion forum, I haven't received answer to the questions that I'm posting(since right now it's holiday season, I can exempt them from not replying).I knew I could carry on with this irritation and still get the course certificate for which I've paid for, but then there is no point in wasting time in which the explanation is not clear. It would take me almost 20 to 30 minutes to make notes over a 5 minute long video. I would rather read a book on this subject.I would have appreciated if they followed certain steps:1) Make some course material which will help students read and revise information.2) Suggest some reading/reference material to understand the concepts which are not otherwise covered in this course.3) Use pointers(touch screen devices) to show and point out which equations are being referred to and maintain synchronicity between the information given in the slides and the one said by the instructor.4) Supplementary lectures are extremely fast paced and please don't take derivation of an equation for granted and please do explain.So, if you are looking forward to do this course, I suggest you go forward if you have an in-depth knowledge about vectors, matrices and calculus.",1
90711,"It is very beneficial, but i just feel it could be a little more specific",4
90712,"It is a great course for me. At the end of the course, I learned how to generate a trajectory having several set waypoints and have my drone follow the trajectory autonomously in simulation.As opposed to the stated prerequisite, I believe the course requires engineering/math/physics background.On the down side, there is no TA presence in the discussion forum. You will need to rely on your classmates if you are stuck. Also the second assignment requires hours of tuning, which serves almost no educational purpose.",4
90713,"great course, very interesting",5
90714,educational yet simple,5
90715,Good as a basic course. The MATLAB visualizations help newer entrants to the field.,4
90716,"gained a good grasp of the concepts of mathematical modelling, representation and manipulation of angular variables. the assignments were a good opportunity to practice concepts learned within the course. really good overall. While I recognise that not everything can be covered in a 4 week course, it would have been nice to have a small preview of how information from onboard cameras are processed for navigation and also one more control approach.",5
90717,"The course is definitely has some value. At least it helps to feel the taste of quadrotor control. But there are some cons. 4 weeks is too short, and this entails fragmentation of course materials. A lot of reasonable questions are not answered and even not mentioned: we use Euler's angles, which lead to singularities and ambiguities, there are quaternions, but we'll not use it. Why? - no answer. PD gains tuning is manual. Is there any robust methods to build controls automatically? - no answer. And so on and so forth. And the last... lections are really boring, lector monotonically reads text, nevermind what - matrices, formulas, etc. He reads all of it in completely, with the same manner, without any interactivities with the slides. Actually it is realy demotivates. I guess one of students that made supplementary materials with marker will do much much better.Anyway, thanks for the course. I believe that highly motivated learner can get something new from it.",3
90718,Very good course!,5
90719,"This course covers some most advanced topics about quadrotor's modeling, control and mapping.",5
90720,Realy good course to introduce to the design of drones.,5
90721,Very encouraging and challenging with lot of learning on the way. Dr. Vijay and his colleagues have made this course sufficient in information and resources required for the course. I feel privileged to be a part of this course. I will try to implement these learning in my professional work. Thank You,5
90722,great course overall!,5
90723,"this course is really awesome and helpful , thanks",5
90724,Very interesting,5
90725,"I'm sorry, but I felt the week 4 assignment materials is not consistent to lesson videos or the lesson video does not explained enough.I think that making students think does not mean making explanation indistinct.",2
90726,awesome course learnt a lot of aspects of compuational motion planning,5
90727,Excellent course!Describes in depth the kinematics governing a quad-rotor.Requires good math and physics understanding. More analytical than programming (for those expecting to just write code that can be flashed on a controller).,5
90728,"It's my first course in coursera. Aerial Robotics is a great course for me to learn more about quadrotor control. Some tools in matlab are very useful to help me deeply understand the material of the course. Unfortunately, formula or model of control have not explained yet. I hope, formula of model of the control can be explained, even it need external source or refer to some books. :)",4
90729,a great course to start learning about robotics,5
90730,"Not a beginner course. You need an engineering background to know how to interpret the equations enough to finish the coding assignments in Matlab. Some of the equations presented don't have enough explanation behind them for them to seem in context or to give any idea about how they can be applied.I have a background in electrical engineering, and I studied control systems in undergrad, so I was able to get by. If you can't manage through this course, don't feel like you aren't smart enough to complete it; rather, you just don't have the proper pre-requisites.",3
90731,"Got through the first week, and started second week. The auxiliary videos are great. Right to the point. The course itself has been very true to what it offers. It makes you get your hands dirty very quickly too.",5
90732,Really Helpful. The way they've explained stuff with such ease makes it totally worth it.,4
90733,Best Robotics class ever,5
90734,Excellent material. Slightly difficult but rewarding.,5
90735,Final Assignment was very unclear,4
90736,"great course, I was trying to learn how to control a quadrotor and at the end of the course I managed to control it.",5
90737,Amazing course for anyone interest in robotics~,5
90738,This course helped to understand the dynamics of the Quad copter and the implementation of the equations. Can recommend for all looking for start with Aerial robotics.,5
90739,Took me more than initial 4 weeks to finish the course. The classmates discussion forum is really helpful. The moderators however are very silent. Not giving enough feedbacks and help most of the time.,4
90740,"Although some technical difficulties with simulations, this course is more than interesting and I will definitely recommend it for those passionate about robotics.",5
90741,Excellent Course!! The hands on experience on the Quadcopter Simulators on the MATLAB helped us understand the control concepts behind Motion and Trajectory Planning.,5
90742,Very clear exdplanation of quadrotor dynamics and kinematics,5
90743,Not for those with no background in advanced engineering math. Expect to pick up independently most of the things that are being taught.,3
90744,"Hard, very interesting and great! :)",5
90745,Very nice introductory course on aerial robotics.,4
90746,Very interesting! I really recommend. I don't agree with people who says it's only PD tunning. It entails comprehensions of physics and control.,4
90747,"Good contents! However, the lectures are long and a bit rushed. This course is definitely not for everyone! Assignment for week 3 definitely need an extra lecture to explain to do PID tuning.",4
90748,Very good contents.Excellent assignments.You'll need to work hard to pass it but you enjoy the effort.,5
90749,"This course is quite tough, and I often thought to myself: ""If this is an intermediate level, what does a professional level look like?"" Especially the later assignments are quite difficult and time consuming to solve (it says, you need approximately three hours to solve the last one. Well, it took me about 30 hours to come up with a half-decent attempt).However: if you really want to learn something new about cool flying robots (and who doesn't?) and are willing to spend quite an amount of effort and time, this is the course for you!",4
90750,"Much better Courses are available for free on udacity and edx. this is only a money making course. concepts used are very old. nothing new in this course. One can dwell in PID controllers for life, its a huge are and the way its used here is totally ancient. its just some ancient methods in new quadcopters.",2
90751,Its great,5
90752,"A very useful course. I like the model of a quadrotor very much. I also like that the professor shares their research papers and PhDs. The only thing I don't like are the changes in notation in different lessons / programming exams (this goes for ""des"" variables""). In addition, the supplementary materials, should be read by some one with a little bit less pitch in the voice :P",5
90753,Really good. Unavoidably complicated at times but presented well.Later assignments are quite difficult.,5
90754,"it's good to understand the aerial robotics. it's quite hard for me, as English is not my native language. it's better if all the basic terms can be explained in supplyment material, such as body fixed frame, inertia frame, etc. The assignment is very good and helped me to understand the drones fly and controller. Finally it's better to have all the mathmatical proof in supplyment material if it's too long in the video.",5
90755,Amazing Course And the mentor is too good.,5
90756,Excellent course. Lots of exciting things to learn,5
90757,"Very good and thorough, some improvement in assignment instructions may be considered. One of the best courses I have taken, other courses of this specialization also seem very good.",5
90758,I hope I can do the assignment which is about high velocity and big angle.I have passed through this course.Thanks very much.,5
90759,"Great class with lots of wonderful information!I just wish the homeworks were less of a tedious exercise of controller tuning and more about implementing theory. Other than that, great course!",4
90760,Prof Kumar has taught some of the difficult topics very lucidly. This course is a must to anyone interested in Robotics and Control Systems!!,5
90761,"The only thing I think that put this course on the back foot is the absence of mentors and TAs. They should be pretty active enough to clear the doubts that pops up while clearing quizzes or programming assignments. Its just the people on the forum that comes handy but even when they are not sure about the concept then the going becomes tough. Apart from that, the course is one of the best of its kind and trust me you will never regret doing this certification !!! Good job team UPenn !!!",4
90762,"This course is not even considered as an introduction it's a complementary for those whose career is robotics , in other words the required prerequisites are more than matlab programming skills and some calculus and algebra, its assignments have many problems that cannot be solved using just the course studying.the course doesn't give many information.",1
90763,Very well designed course. Enough material is covered and the exercises are very well designed and meaningful. It's a rewarding experience. It worths every minute you spend on it.,5
90764,"Interesting course. But definitely not for beginners. With a designer background, I could never accomplish this course. I really hope Penn could offer course in such topic for beginners!",2
90765,Very interesting course a great start for an specialization,5
90766,It is very useful for design engineers.....but have maths as pre requiste,4
90767,"Great, an interesting introduction to the quadrotors dynamics and control, so expected.",5
90768,"The video lectures provide an introduction to quadrotor flight dynamics and path planning. The lectures are ok.Unfortunately:At least one of the coding assignments has a significant bug in the termination condition. The mentors will ignore any help requests that deal with the bug in their code.The assignments involve a lot of hand tuning of PD controllers. That's a reasonable task to perform once or twice, but it rapidly becomes extremely tedious and detracts from the other materials that are being taught.The final assignment doesn't do a particularly good job evaluating the required test condition.If you do take the course I'd want you to know:You should expect to modify the provided code to fix their bugs.There are no ""gotcha"" quiz questions. If you are confused by getting a question wrong you might want to re-try your answer. There seems to be a bug in the way at least one quiz question is set up.On the final assignment you can modify the simulation step where it makes things run in ""real time"". Removing that step makes the simulation run much more quickly and allows for faster iteration.To conclude:This is a course with a lot of potential, but unless Coursera makes an effort to improve the course I would not recommend it.",1
90769,"Very useful for beginners, Simple, end to the point, and most importantly contains drones :)",5
90770,Excellent Material Lined up in perfect order.,5
90771,"the course is a good topic, but the exercises are mainly teaching you how to write a PD control and tune the PD parameters.",5
90772,"Very challenging, but rewarding",5
90773,I like your course very much!,5
90774,Great learning experience :D,5
90775,Lots of useful Details handed out here,5
90776,"The course provides a good insight into the world of Aerial Robotics and the dynamics involved in controlling the quad-rotors. Were the course fails is it does not explain the basics , there is more focus on trial and error and the questions are not formulated correctly such that they are simple to understand. It could have been better if the Introductory course to the specialization had little mathematical involved or could have been explained in simpler terms or with examples instead of showing the equation in the video.",3
90777,"This is the first mooc I learned completely , I have learned a lot and I have to say the course ignited my inspiration in aerial robot. At last , I hope the course can provide more specific detail about how to make the robot and I am fascinated with this. Thanks to Professor Vijay Kumar and Thanks to Penn university.",5
90778,"Very interesting course, very good lessons and lectures!but I´ve missed some tips about quadrotors electronics.",5
90779,"I really enjoyed this course and it really hooked me onto this topic, definitely this will not be the last robotics course I am going to follow. That being said there are some points of improvement.The main parts necessary to program the simulation assignments are covered in the materials, but there are still some of them that need to be pursued independently. Some assumptions have to be made that are not so obvious, I do not know whether it is the intention of this course to do so or not, but since they are minor footnotes that may hinder completely your results, I think they should be made explicit.The Matlab files available for the course work as intended, what is not so obvious though is how they are intended to work, that is because there is very little documentation about them, it would be great if there was more documentation available, especially for people who have never used such tools before.Finally, even though I personally enjoyed this course and I think it had an achievable level of challenge for me, I would definitely not recommend this course for total beginners, or people who do not have followed a math, physics or engineering degrees. The way the course is laid out, even if you do not understand the concepts behind each topic you will still manage to answer the quizzes and get the simulations to work eventually, however to truly understand what they mean and be able to replicate them in other environments requires some prior knowledge that cannot be taught in just a few hours.",4
90780,Great class with free access and introduction to MATLAB,5
90781,"One of the best courses to pursue in the field of Robotics. The course is well-structured in terms of both the lectures and the assignments. It covers kinematics, dynamics, control, and trajectory planning in a short span of four weeks and also provides an opportunity to test the ideas in the simulation.",5
90782,"Rather hard, but very interesting.",5
90783,"The courses and assignments are so great! Courses include a whole flow of learning robotics, from kinematics to dynamics and from motion control to trajectory planning. The concepts may be difficult to follow, but professor Kumar and TAs really make it easy for me. Really recommended to those who are interested in robotics!",5
90784,"The course covered very interesting topics, but it would have preferred more detailed explanation of PD controllers and especially how to choose the tuning constants.",3
90785,"Great course It was a real eye opener for me, an aerospace professional and owner of two multi-rotor drones.",5
90786,thank you so much for this useful course,5
90787,"Not for the faint of heart as you are expected to be (somewhat) up-to-date on derivatives and primitives for position, velocity, and acceleration. However, even with a minimum background in mathematics and a healthy dose of determination it is possible to succeed in this course. Do not expect it to be easy but really worthwhile if one is interested in quadrotors and ""what makes them fly"".",4
90788,Great material and very good explanations of the topics.,5
90789,really helpful,5
90790,Enjoyed the course. It was a good introduction. There is a good room for improvement though:1- More time should be spent on 3D quadrotor control2- Trajectory planning was not completely explained; importantly 2d and 3d need a lot more attention with focus on solving for minimum snap trajectory3- TA support was almost unavailable. TAs should be active during the course,4
90791,it is a great course with a very good illustrating and explanation that is easy to understand .. THANK YOU FOR THIS wonderful work,5
90792,its awesome,5
90793,"Really fascinating material and loads of good information in the lectures. The homework assignments were satisfying if you can complete them, but unfortunately involved a lot of tedious trial and error. This was especially difficult since running the program can be slow which causes slow iteration of trial and error. I would not have been able to complete the assignments without helpful information in the course discussions.",4
90794,Extremely well orchestrated lectures and good assignments.,5
90795,Excellent course. Highly recommended.The mathematical notations are sometimes confusing.,4
90796,"Great course! I like that there was lots of material for things that I might have not studied before but were necessary for the course.Assignments :I understand that getting people to tune PID manually gets them to understand things better, but cmon, not every single coursework!",4
90797,"This course is great - a lot of knowledge, good form of the course, helpful instructors.",5
90798,Great course. Make sure you brush up on your Linear Algebra.,5
90799,The course is theoretically great but i think it needs some more focus on the coding of path plannes taught theoretically.,4
90800,"I thought the course was very laid out in going from an overview towards more specific and harder material. For the most part, I thought the assignments were very good and did a thorough job of teaching feedback control. My only problem with the assignments were that they seem to overemphasize a trial and error approach for tuning the k gains. This became very tedious especially on the third assignment where the simulator ran so slowly.",4
90801,At the end I do not feel that I have learned something.,3
90802,well taught!! :),5
90803,"Advertised as an easy course, week 1 is simple but quickly becomes far too difficult by week 2... Too late for your refund.",1
90804,This part was good but it would have been much more informative if bit more is added.,4
90805,Just PID in MATLAB and not very well explained.,2
90806,"IT is a brief course regarding Robotics, but adequate. It leave lots of room to understand. But provide enough to dig deeper into the Areal robotics. I am able to grasp the course work and work along with the pace set by instructor. All in all it was a good 5 weeks worth of lecture and hands on to simulations.",4
90807,Great course.,5
90808,It's a complete robotics course !!!!,5
90809,funnygood demonstrationbad TAgood community,5
90810,this is wonderful course,5
90811,"Really testing course. Get's pretty tricky, especially the final assignment.The staff is really helpful and the content is top-notch.",4
90812,"Very poor. Assignments consist of transcription of formulae given in lectures, and then manually searching the parameter space for solutions.",1
90813,Excellent course as an introduction to robotics basics.,5
90814,"Great, but needs more material to fill in the gaps. Could do with a little more on the advanced topics like trajectory generation. Definitely needs more motivational examples. Videos of the lab and demonstrations of the research relevant to this course (done by the course provider) would be great.",4
90815,"great school, great teacher,great lesson!",5
90816,Assignments for week 3 and 4 were very tough and a little guidance was provided on how to do the coding part. But since I'm interested in the course i'm re-enrolling to complete it this time.,2
90817,"A very good course, expecially for the MATLAB part. They can improve with more assignment in MATLAB and with some more theoretical stuff, like more types of trajectories, more types of controllers and so on. However, is one of the best course that I attended online in a few years. I absolutely recommend it.",4
90818,Very good. Practical information.,5
90819,Fun. And interesting as well.,5
90820,really helpful,5
90821,This has been an excellent nintrodution to feedback controllers using UVA. I look forward for the next session. Fully recommended if you want to lear PD controllers!,5
90822,Some topics were explained in a shallow manner. I suggest providing detailed lecture notes besides the videos for students trying to understand math and physics behind the concepts introduced in videos,3
90823,It's a very nice course,5
90824,"Excellent. Thanks, Vijay. I watched your video and did a few lessons. My focus was the difference between airborne formation flying as applied to satellites.-Byron Knight",5
90825,"I found this course to be stimulating and challenging. The coursework is much more difficult than the prerequisites would have you believe. I found myself dusting off my old linear algebra texts and matrix math notes. In the end, I worked through it, but it was a struggle.",4
90826,Super awesome course!,5
90827,Awesome explanation and Point to Point analysis by the Professor.Highly Recommended!,5
90828,This course is geat!!,5
90829,"Fantastic course, I have learned a lot of important this about robotics that are very usefull to complement my formation as Electronic Engineer. Thanks",5
90830,"Very good course. If you love quadrotors and want to learn a lot about the way their control, motion planning, collision avoidance etc work, take the course.",5
90831,"A good overview on various fields of Robotics, especially control. Quizzes seemed a little ambiguous but lectures and assignments were very informative!",4
90832,thank you vijay sir for this wonderful lecture,5
90833,"This is a very nice class about the aerial robotics. If the more background materials about the quadrotor are provied in the class content, the class will be better.",4
90834,"Great class, I have already recommended it to many friends.",5
90835,"This is an excellent course that is beautifully structured with a perfect balance of theory and labs, and a neat set of additional help lectures.",5
90836,"This course successfully covers the mechanics and control topics of quadrotors. The course also points to some resources in order to extend your study on UAVs. However, there are some issues concerning the assignments which I didn't like at all:1. Big gap in difficulty between assignments of first three weeks compared with the assignment of the fourth week.2. The difficulty of the assignments of the first three weeks just relied on sweeping (somewhat 'smartly') a 1,2,3, or 6 dimensional parametric space. I guess that real UAVs engineers are not paid for this. In some assignment, I had to edited a file which I was not supposed to edit in order to pass it.3. The last assignment was quite frustrating for the following reasons3a. Really long running times to test if the parameters work fine. I would sacrifice the fancy real-time visualization to save some time. Apart from long running times, I guess that UAVs are not solving ODEs in real time on board, so I think is more interesting a more practical/real-time approach.3b. Search in a 12-dimensional parametric space (some parameters are equal, but still you end up tunning 5,6 independent parameters, which influence each other). Come on, is this useful? I am sure that UAVs engineers don't spend their hours in this kind of crappy search. You could explain at least some existing heuristics when having so many control parameters to tune.3c. Even though the drone trajectory seems to fit perfectly the planned trajectory, you might not pass the exercise, and you would get some clueless messages telling you the final position/velocity is not correct.3d. The assignment guide is very unclear in some parts.3e. A lot of typos in the formulas of the last part of the guide. I decided to completely ignore it and develop my own strategy, which turned out to be far simpler and easier to implement.3f. The submission program tests the whole exercise regardless you passed some sections or not, which make the waiting times even longer.",2
90837,it's need more explanation and specific resources,4
90838,"Excellent course, good planned and good use of online resources. Some things that could be improved are: encouraging students to implementation using hardware, not only simulations, and also there is a lot of material in the course that is rapidly reviewed, some more time could be invested into this.",4
90839,This course definitely requires prerequisite knowledge of calculus and matrix math. There is also very little in the way of practical application. The MatLab work is interesting but barely explained. The assignments were nearly impossible without help from other students. Understanding which equations that were shown in the lecture (not necessarily explained) were useful in completing the assignments was not apparent and there was no help from the TAs.I don't think the assignments were irrelevant but without having a background in academic engineering the course needs to walk through similar exercises with explanations to increase understanding and ability to complete the course.While I don't think this course was well presented and I can't say I truly learned anything I am glad I was exposed to the material and I will continue with the Specialization.,2
90840,Perfect simulation!,5
90841,"I enjoyed the writeups as their explained system modelling very well. The first two assignments are a bit lacking in terms of what they teach, I believe one should instead handle the generation of the quad rotor system model and the other should teach control with the final teaching traj generation.",4
90842,"I Learned a lot! Great team - teacher and supporting students.The lessons from the last week take a big jump in the subject, but is still feasible.Best regards.",5
90843,"A tough score, which I have mixed feelings about as there was good stuff in here too. The course material is interesting and moves at a robust pace and I do think they have made an effort despite the fact that much of it appears lifted from one PhD student's dissertation. Realistically I would not recommend this course if you don't have a STEM Bachelor's degree and you will likely find it painful if you have been away from your degree more than three years. None of this is bad, although the material would have benefitted by being spread out by perhaps two more weeks as realistically people who have been in the workplace a long time may need more time, and have less time per week with family commitments. Unfortunately there are a number of areas that need work:1 - Inconsistencies and errors in the material. Certain unexplained suffixes in equations and worse, changes in the suffixes without indication that they changed or what they are. I don't feel that this was particularly widespread but it did result in some loss of confidence in the course and time being wasted ""interpreting""2 - Tests throughout the course that often provide the relatively limited feedback of ""correct well done"" or worse I'm sorry to say, the relatively useless feedback ""sorry that is not correct"", without ANY explanation of why it was correct or more importantly what an incorrect answer should have been and why. I can understand that this will hopefully drive students should do more research, but if they hit a wall, realistically they're going to keep iterating on the answers until you pass and learn nothing because of the time pressure to complete by the end of the week. I wonder if there is a better mechanism that can be used here3 - TA Support - The lack of TA support coupled with some concern about a history of errors led the students to believe that there was an error in week 3. For 10 days students went back and forth debating which one of the two equations that were supposedly doing the same thing but with missing terms were correct. NOT ONCE did a TA wake up and step in. In the end one of the students flagged the video as ""inappropriate"" to wake the UPenn organization up. The TA then stepped in and said (I paraphrase) ""oh, we just dropped those terms because they're not so important, but we didn't mention that..."" If you are not going to adequately support the students, the material had better be bullet-proof and show some linear thinking4 - The last exam. Keep in mind if you do this course, you had better be comfortable with calculus, linear algebra, vector math/mechanics and it would be helpful to have a head start in Matlab. That said, the last question in the last exam, was an order of magnitude more challenging than everything else set and almost felt like a ""shake out"" question. I passed the course and had a good understanding of the material, but I suspect that the folks that did, made it through that last question in multiple random fashions. The material itself is relatively academic and the trajectory topic was definitely so. Unfortunately the one example (jerk trajectory) provided appears to have left a lot of students feeling very unsupported based on feedback I saw, and would probably benefit from having an example more fully worked through. As for the final exam, it would be highly desirable for UPenn to provide insight into how they would have solved the last part of the last question as my concern is that there is a whole contingent of people who did this course who didn't come away with as good a grounding on trajectories as they may believe they have",2
90844,Love the course and the amazing demonstrations in the lab.,5
90845,"I think there is need to provide clearer instructions on how to get the programming assignments done. The course content is good, but doing the programming assignments needs to be more clarified.",3
90846,"Very challenging, but worthwhile.",5
90847,Mind Blowing course...!!!,4
90848,"I think this course does not a good job of explaining the mathematics very well. The supplementary material is very good in that regard, compared to the lectures. However, there are too few to make up for it. I would need a few example calculations of similar problems to what we are expected to solve in the exercises.As a result, my learning success is not very satisfactory.",2
90849,Very nice course but at the end everything was just thrown at you to figure out on your own,4
90850,"Wow!!!Great course. Should add Matlab and understanding of basic Calculus to the prerequisites for those not familiar with those concepts. The sidebar videos helped refresh concepts for those of us not in an Engineering program, but have had the material before. Can't wait for the next classes!!",5
90851,"the course and the lessons are really interesting and the professor is explaining really well. Especially nice are all the videos demonstrating what have been done so far.Problem are the assignments:-all the assignments are about controlling a quadrotor, but a matlab code 95% done is already provided and most of the times the only thing requested is to spend days in find (randomly) the correct values for the controller gains;-the last assignment is again partly about (randomly) looking for gain values and partly about generating a trajectory as a piecewise 7th order polynomial, where the method for creating such thing is only mentioned in the assignment pdf and with wrong conditions. Even with the correct conditions, with a previous knowledge of numerical methods you can go through it, but otherwise it takes quite some time;-the grade is not set properly.. you either take 0points or the maximum, meaning that for just passing the assignment you have the same difficulty as getting full marks.. if you arrive (after days of trial and error) to the point of passing the assignment, then you can easily get full grade with small changes.. which makes no sense;-the explanatory pdf for the assignments or the provided codes some times contain errors, and I don't understand why they are not fixed considering that this course is already the second time that was provided;-the assignments are fully based on matlab and to actually understand something it is required quite a deep knowledge of how to use it.. I work daily with matlab and had some difficulties in following what it is done. If somebody is new to matlab, it will be quite difficult to do even the easier tasks;-the evaluation function for the last assignment is extremely slow.. it took me 40minutes to evaluate the results.. and considering the many iterations usually required for (randomly) finding the gains this really doesn't help.Summarising I am quite happy about this course and glad to have done it, but please fix the many problems in the assignments. I have taken many courses online in different platforms and this was so far the most time consuming one..",3
90852,Challenging course. Great!,5
90853,"I really enjoyed this course and felt the material was appropriate in scope and quality for an introduction to Aerial Robotics. I have a few issues with it though.While this wasn't a problem for me, I feel those who haven't done maths with vectors and matrices before would struggle with the maths presented here.There was some inconsistency in notation throughout the lectures - though I expect this will be fixed in future runs of this course.Given how much the programming assignments involved tuning PD controllers, I think there should have been some additional material provided on how to go about doing this.The difficulty of the last programming assignment came out of nowhere and given that you need to pass all the assignments in order to pass the course, this made it especially stressful. Having gotten almost full marks on the course until that point, the prospect of that all being for naught because I couldn't complete the final assignment in time was incredibly stressful and unfair. The simulation would fail with a Matlab ode45 error - with absolutely no information as to why that should fail. Trying to debug something by guesswork on a time limit is not a valuable educational experience.I feel all of these issues are fixable though and on balance I think this was a very good course.",4
90854,"Not well prepared and not well explained. They throw formulas at you and read it aloud instead of explaining the nature behind those.They change notations every lecture, sometimes in the same lecture. It's easy but these things made it artificially dificult.At least it's better than the next one in the specialization",2
90855,Overall the information provided in the class was very valuable and up to date in describing the kinematics and dynamical control for a Quadrotor.,4
90856,"The course is interesting and entertaining at times, though seems relatively undercooked. Typos in video lectures and assignment writeups are still frequent. The course content is a bit rushed, with some rather difficult aspects left almost unexplained. Definitely not for begginers, as some knowledge of physics, differential equations, calculus, matlab programming is highly recommended!",3
90857,Great course!,5
90858,Extremely helpful and informative. Though an advanced knowledge of physics is required.,5
90859,Has allot of typos but the content is good overall,4
90860,"My feeling is that the course creator(s) did not fully prepare and scope of the course materials (i.e., lectures, supporting artifacts, assignments) required for the available time alloted to each week's topic. No syllubus or suggested reading material was available until the course started, which leaves little time to decide on the value of the course or to acquire the reading materials. The lectures glossed over topics that where only minimally supported by brief supplementary lectures provided by the teaching assistants. At the start of the course the lectures and sparse supporting material were only available in video format; not very conducive for detailed review. The student population had to beg for electronic copies of the materials, which became available around the end of the second week of the four week session. The assignments say they require 3 hours, but I would venture to say that most students have spent way more than 3 hours on the assignments just in researching solutions let alone debugging supplied software along with their portion of the assignment. In summary, the topics were interesting however the organization and supporting materials were lacking making for an unsatisfying learning experience.",2
90861,"I had very high hopes for this course. I was actually planning to purchase the specialization - just as a thank you gesture. Unfortunately, there is very little to be grateful for here.In this course, you get a series of super short lectures giving you an overview of the math and physics behind the aerial robotics. I can't be the judge (since I hold a degree in this area), but I don't think you'll be able to get much if you aren't familiar with the topics yet. And you most certainly won't learn anything new if you had some previous training.And then suddenly there are assignments. That have almost nothing to do with the lectures, but require quite a bit of Matlab programming (did I mention you won't be taught any Matlab in the process?) To make things worse, the assignments are rather poorly explained.By the way, you won't get any replies from the course team - they even ignore questions about errors in lectures.The course looks very sloppy. As if someone forced the team to put together something for Coursera. A huge disappointment :(",1
90862,"Some good material and I good introduction to aerial robotics. But, it doesn't cover all the theory needed to actually write flight control software for a quad copter. If you are really new to robotics you will need to spend at least 40-50 hours a week ""discovering"" enough of the details to pass the course.",3
90863,best course for engineers.,5
90864,only recommended for those who have knowledge in linear algebra and calculus,4
90865,"The quiz and assignment are poorly designed. Important issues are overlooked or just briefly discussed in lecture. The assignment focuses on matlab coding, which only emphasizes the coding technique. Do not recommend to audience with",1
90866,"Everything was so relevant and finely explained, but It clearly wasn't a beginner's course, it's mora an Intermediate Course. You must know basics about control systems and Matlab coding to succesfully pass this course.",5
90867,Perfect !,5
90868,"A great course, though it's recommended that you have some basic experience in linear algebra before taking it.",5
90869,"Great course, this help me learn and somewhat increased my interest in Robotics.",5
90870,"I found the course fun and engaging. I studied Physics a while ago; without this I think I would have had problems following the contents.I wish the first two programming assignments were combined, so that there was room for another assignment for implementing a full 3d controller that doesn't assume a linearization around the hover state.",4
90871,"This course was not a beginning level course as advertised.Test cases for assignments were neither document nor otherwise explained within the course materials. Quizzes during the lecture were often unrelated to the material just presented or were given before the relevant material was taught.The course creators obviously put a lot of time and effort into this course. So it is difficult for me to write such a critical review. However, they missed the mark with this one enough that I can't recommend the course.Unfortunately I will not be completing this course only due to the fact that I have run out of time and patience to complete the last assignment.",1
90872,Not for beginners. Prerequisites definitely required,4
90873,"This course had an excellent syllabus, but left much to be desired in the methodology adopted for teaching. There was very low involvement of the TA in the discussion forums and there should have been more material given to help bridge the gap between pre requisites and the course content.",4
90874,"I loved the course, it was way beyond my expectations. Everything well explained. I only have on critic. I think the assignment of 5 waypoints trajectory was not in accordance with the rest of the course. Imagine the tests following a level line and abruptly changes to something too hard. I think the purpose here is to learn and not find out people with special skills. Many of our colleagues that were following the course simple gave up due to this assignment. And also took 25 hours average for many of us, that not dispose of this time, since the proposed time to complete the tasks are of three hours.",4
90875,A good lecture material. All is presented step by step and clearly. I would like more exercise on the calculation of the rotation matrix on the transformation and displacement of objects. Thanks Professor Vijay Kumar and support team.,4
90876,"So close but yet so far ...Course concepts are interesting and the programming assignments are fun but the presentation can be greatly improved.Criticisms include:(i) The course isn't self contained. Physical concepts like 'resultant moment', 'inertial and body-fixed frame' and 'torque' are used without definition. Mechanics is not listed as a prerequisite but it should be.(ii) Lectures are very mathematical but proofs, intuition and good problem sets are all missing. Listening to a math lecture without doing challenging problems or deriving mathematical results to build intuition can be a waste of time. Check out John Cochrane's Asset Pricing 1 and 2 or Tim Roughgarden's Algo 1 and 2 for great examples of thoughtful problem sets and intuitive derivations.(iii) Way too much powerpoint! Speed reading a static powerpoint slide overloaded with dense mathematical formulas without using pointers or animations to focus the students attention is a recipe for confusion and frustration. I find hand written derivations, even when the handwriting is a little sloppy, much easier to follow than a static page of formulas plus a sound track. Hand written derivations impose a natural pace and focal point to the content. Check out Gilbert Strang's Linear Algebra, Sebastian Thrun's Artificial Intelligence for Robotics and Andrew Ng's Machine Learning for examples of good derivations of mathematically sophisticated material.(iv) The programming assignments while fun were somewhat ad hoc and disconnected from the lecture material, specifically, the main task of every single assignment was to hand tune a pd controller. No systematic approach was ever described for performing this task.",1
90877,"All in all the material, videos and assignments were very interesting and they made up an exciting course.However, some of the slides lacked sufficient information on notions or did not make references to supplementary sources. The assignment material (mainly pdfs) sometimes had typos which made solving them a bit confusing and more time consuming without actually being very difficult. Also for both slides and assignments the notations were not always consistent and/or variables disappeared from equations without clear explanations.I hope in the next offering of this course there will be improvements on these aspects.",3
90878,This is a totally theoretical course. This actually does not help to build a quadcopter from the scratch. It should have been mentioned in the introduction. I am opting out. The lectures did not seem appropriate for the people without proper background. Not satisfied.,1
90879,"I liked the course and the assignments. I felt that the assignments covered materials which weren't part of the course or not explained well enough. I managed to get through them, but it felt lacking.",4
90880,I enjoyed the structure and materials of this course. I found the manner of increasing the difficult of assignments to be appropriately gradual and accessible for someone with some programming background,5
90881,awesome course best course ive done on coursea so far :),5
90882,"Very good Course, I recommend it for those who want to achive basic control for UAVs.",5
90883,"I think there needs to be more association elaborated between the video lectures and the questions being asked during the lectures. It seems these questions are asked before the lecture itself tends to touch the point of it.Secondly, it was a bit difficult to associate the assignment write-ups to the lectures. Obviously they were relevant but this should be more clear in text and video.",3
90884,An excellent course for those who interested to acquire a basement in the field of robotics,5
90885,"This course covered a lot of material, provided a well-rounded intro to the physics of 3D motion in the quad rotor context, included excellent supplemental videos to explain some of the tough mathematical concepts, and included well-designed practical assignments.The bridge between lecture and assignment, particularly the trajectory planning question in the last assignment, could be refined as the course iterates, although the material I found myself struggling through that very tough problem may be that which I retain most from this class.Over all an excellent class, and I'm looking forward to the rest of the series.",4
90886,"The course contains a lot of good tools and techniques needed for a robotics enthusiast, but the material is not very well explained. A lot of background knowledge and self-research is expected to keep up with the course.",4
90887,Excellent course for beginners,5
90888,It was a fantastic course.,5
90889,"the course is ok, but the assignment require a lot of prior knowledge on automation control theory, which can be really difficult to be done.I suggest that they should provide extra material for those students who have only computer science background.",3
90890,"Great course, I would recommend this course for anyone interested in Quadrotors and programming algorithms to control them!The assignments based on MATLAB simulations were also a fun approach to visually observing our algorithms in use!",4
90891,Quizzes and Assignments are poorly designed. You will spend most of your time tuning parametersand deriving matrices that were never discussed in the course. Unfortunate.,2
90892,"Good course overall, since I took it the first time it was offered it was still not quite polished. I liked the focus on quadrocopter simulation and creating controllers. I think it would benefit from more specific discussion forums for quizzes/assignments, being able to view past quiz attempts, and cleaning up typos/errors in the material.",4
90893,"TAs should have been more available/active in discussions (especially given the scale of the last assignment), otherwise enjoyable/challenging course",4
90894,"Good ,but many complaints regarding PID tuning from students need to be addressed in the upcoming sessions",3
90895,"Overall good course that would definitely make you spend more time reading and learning on the side. Would recommend it those who have good background in college level math like Linear Algebra and a little bit of Robotics Background from a Math perspective - like working with translations, rotations, transformation matrices of that sort to make the transition easier. (There are basic robotic courses online to help with that, like Peter Corke's course). But overall this course requires some significant effort to explore the material from an external perspective.Some issues however -1. Lack of added resources like reading material to support the course and help advanced students go beyond the course themselves.2. Severe lack of activity from TA(s) on the forums. It's good that students get to interact among themselves and learn on their own, but every single post should be either answered by a TA to clarify doubts or they should acknowledge that another student's explanation was good enough to answer a particular question.3. The in-video quizzes weren't up-to-the-mark as per me. One question asked ""why"" and the answer was literally ""because that's how that algorithm is"".4. This is a trend in MOOCs and I don't think it can be helped, but perhaps more assignments that help understand the concepts better with examples would help students go beyond. If this course had such optional assignments that would be great for understanding the concepts with a more hands-on approach. But this is probably not the best platform to do so.Overall would recommend future iterations of this course, especially if the first two points above are improved upon.",3
90896,"There were minor errors in the quizzes but I loved the course, would be nice to use some open source tool besides matlab.Best regards.",4
90897,"One of the most useful courses, if you are planning to study robotics seriously. This course covers very important theoretical material, which you probably never find in internet in compact form.You should prepare your mind, because this course requires careful attention, and deep comprehension. If you just a beginner, you should be ready to see a lot of math and mechanics, because this is a real robotics. But if you truly like robotics, and specially, aerial robotics, this course for you.Personally for me - this is a course, which I was looking for a long time",5
90898,"Very interesting course, with some toothing problems and unrealistic timescales for many.For me, it would have been impossible to complete the course without the support of some extremely bright and helpful classmates, active in discussion fora (almost a given in a MOOC, but nevertheless, a course should be designed such that one could complete it without the fora).More guidance on the programming assignments would be the first thing I would focus on for the next edition, as well as setting some realistic timescales (there is probably no way for the majority of participants to complete the last assignment within the 3 hours advised for it...).",4
90899,It is a well done course and the topic it is very interesting. I sincerly recommend it.,5
90900,Good course!,5
90901,Great assignments to solidify an excellent curriculum.,4
90902,Please include supplementary materials on controller tuning.,3
90903,This is a good course with good support. But it still has a few teething problems.,4
90904,"I loved this course. I particularly enjoyed the programming assignments, which taught me a great deal and were extremely satisfying. It is terrific to see a truly rigorous, mathematical engineering course on Coursera. I will gladly sign up for the next course in the series.",5
90905,"This is a more difficult online course that you will come across. I give 4 stars because of the pretty nice content. Learning about writing linear controllers for the desired trajectory in 3D is the best thing we can get out of the course. I don't think this course qualifies as a beginner specialization. Basics (and perhaps little more details) of the topics from Dynamics(Euler equations, differentiation of a vector expressed in one frame wrt to another frame), controls and bit of computation(complexity) is needed. Topics like ""Calculus of variation"" were simply new to me and you have to work little more harder to understand the different equations which will be presented without any derivation. Biggest downside is TA's or other support staff is not pro-active. Perhaps they will improve in the future runs.",4
90906,"first of all, thank you for this course, thanks to it i have got an apportunity to specialise in robotics. I hope this course will help me to be succesful in my future life.best regards Giorgi Gvasalia",5
90907,Very interesting course. Pleasant and well explained. The mathematics related are complicated to follow sometimes but it can be done. The assignments also can be completed following the lectures and the handouts.,4
90908,"This course was very good and very interesting. The teacher explained things well. The BIG problem with the course is that the level of the lectures no way matched the level of the assignments, especially the last one. It was way too hard compared to the material presented. It was supposed to take 3 hours but it took me more like 50 hours. And from the forum it seems like a lot of people spend 40 or more hours on this one last problem. Was too hard and too much. A lot of prayer and sweat I finally got it with a lot if discussion on the forums. But 40 hours for one problem is crazy. There needed to be a lot more thorough instruction in order to do this problem in a reasonable time.",3
90909,Best thing ever!!!! Working out really good. Basic aerial robotics explained in the most effective way.,5
90910,"Although not specifically stated as a requisite this course does rely heavily on mathematics (especially matrix calculations). I did not understand all of the mathematics but was still able to complete the course succesfully. The general idea behind the math was well enough explained. The example videos, excercises and quizes were great fun and inspiring.",4
90911,This course is not a beginner level course rather it is an intermediate one. I had to put in more than 10 hours a week to complete this course. A basic knowledge of control theory is a must.,2
90912,"Very technical course with a mixture of theory and programming. It covers most of the topics related to drone control algorithms and trajectory planning. I would have liked additional topics about PID, quaternions and Kalman filters.",4
90913,"This course feels like a bad news anchorman reading the teleprompter. It gives a lot of formulae without proper explanations. A lot of quiz answers do not come from the video lectures. The course is really just spitting formulae from the dissertation ""Trajectory Generation and Control for Quadrotors"" by Daniel Warren Mellinger (easily found using search engines). Reading the dissertation before doing the course would probably help understand the formulae they say out of context without the proper explanations. Sorry for the bad review, it's the first time I leave one like that, although I've completed many MOOCs. I hope it will help to improve the course.",2
90914,"I'd like to say a big thank you for Professor Kumar for putting this together. I work full time and in my spare time some of my friends are thinking about building a in-house small quadrotor with 3-D printed parts and rasberry pi & basic camara. The information of this course is very, very useful and the Matlab practices and assignments are challenging and interesting.Not to mention this course has successfully pulled me away from my favorite video game...a remarkable achievement.I hope that the notation in the videos and in the assignments could be more clear as that can cause confusion.",5
90915,"Very interesting course. Lectures were very informative howeversome test questions, especially in first quiz, where not covered directlyin course materials.",4
90916,Well balanced mix of theory and practical applicability. Explanation of the material is also very good.The assignments are nicely built on the taught material to stimulate understanding.,5
90917,Its a really great project but one needs to have studied mechanical and really advanced level physics to do this project. But I really got help of the discussion forums to complete the assignments but am not yet clear about the theory of aerial robotics.,3
90918,Quizzes are generally not related to topic but course is great. Thanks..,4
90919,Nice and fast intro. Just the requisite math used and taught.,5
90920,"Excellent, from basic robotics (well you must to have some robotics background) to how to develop your own quadcopter.",5
90921,"Great course. Initiate you to review much of your math and engineering control knowledge by specific problems. This is more of an application course, you see the application, the math behind and use Matlab to program certain situation. Beware, it's a one month course so they don't spend time to walk you through the basic math, some specific terms are explained during the lecture but not all, a reference for some Control book maybe needed to know what are those terms.If you have no knowledge in these area, some supplemental material maybe provided but be ready to learn and explore more on your own.",5
90922,"Overall a good course. But I would suggest the following updates:-there are many formulas in the course that are not explained, just dropped in the slides-there are many inconsistencies in notations (for instance the Kv, Kp used sometimes, other times Kd and Kp)-programming labs should be given in an incremental approach; ex. instead of just requesting a full solution for a given problem, a stepwise approach where the functions are built up to produce intermediate results and slowly add complexity to reach that final goal is much more efficient as a learning tool-supplementary notes are not available-slides for the main lectures are available but they are attached to the videos; it would be better if they are added as an item in the course outline. Many other courses on Coursera do the same thing. Also it would spare the presenter to break down the slide pack into parts corresponding to the videos; just place the whole slide pack for a lesson.",4
90923,The material this course provided is sufficient for a beginner in robotics. But I have to say that the material the coursed presented is not well prepared. The lectures are not well organized. Some necessary prerequisite should be at least provided as reading materials. Quizs ask some questions that is not clearly mentioned in the lecture and some are with a little ambiguity.,2
90924,i have learned so much from this course thank you all,5
90925,"Includes advanced mathematics, I can only recommend this course to students who have a greater understanding of programming and math.",3
90926,"Excellent course! Teachers of the highest level! very interesting topics. Many practical examples. I have a degree in philosophy and two master's degree in physics and statistics, but I have learned a lot - though with many night study hours - thanks to the support of prof. Vijay Kumar of the teaching team. Also, I would like to thank my classmates for the interesting discussion forums. Perhaps without their help, I would not have passed the course. Thank you all! :)",5
90927,"I have a Maths background, but last time I studied Maths was 23 years back.Despite that, the course structure allowed me to catch-up and make sense of the whole class as an experimenter and hacker.Glad I started it.",5
90928,"Amazing course with excellent simulation problems, I have really benefited from this course in understanding control and the underlying mathematics. Thank you so much everyone!",5
90929,The course is awesome in terms of topics covered. But the pace is too fast. moreover the lectures are not comprehensive. It is needed to put more material or refer some notes or books that might help,3
90930,I found the course very good.,5
90931,Wonderfull with its all features.,5
90932,This course was very helpful and facilitated me to understand the theories i learned with the applications.The course materials were very effectively planned and the assignments were very effective to gain the understanding what was taught in the lectures.I highly recommend this course..*******,5
90933,"I truly love the course program and what it covers. And aiding student who can't afford the price by grants is relly nice. Then were students alloweed to download MATLAB freely! But teachers should be clear from the begining, what topics one must grasp before getting one's head into it. I don't think calculus and Linear algebra is enough, given some topics that are spoken about in the course. The teacher can explain mean things and in a second, speaks about totally incomprehensibe subject. Last but not least, I personally think the course lacks on additional materials. It would be really nice if there was something like handouts, pdf readings for deeper understanding of the concepts on offline times.",3
90934,The course includes not only the formulas and calculations but also nice video examples. The assignments seem very challenging to me,5
90935,Learning and fun packaged together nicely. It's definitely challenging but all the info is explained in detail with downloadable videos and through email communication. Thank you for all the hard work to make this so streamlined.,5
90936,"Really bad course. They don't explain the concepts clearly, the quizzes ambiguously ask things not seen in the videos and the instructor introduces equations without further explanation. The course Autonomous Navigation for Flying Robots (edX) is much better.",1
90937,Its a nice effort to teach one Aerial Robotics. But there are many technical things which may not be appropriate for one who has not taken course in Calculas and Mechanics.,5
90938,"The content is awesome and the quizzes and assignments are challenging. What I would incorporate is a little bit more of examples to tackle all the problems new people might encounter (more sample numerical results, and probably samples on how to develop in Matlab, not just reserved words).",4
90939,Very helpful for building by Masters degree project on DRONES,5
90940,"The course should be longer, more detailed and with more background lectures",3
90941,"Awesome Course, Great Professor, Interesting Themes and very practical orientated!!!",5
90942,Great course!,5
90943,"awsome, nicely explained.",5
90944,Full of excellent resources,5
90945,Course material is very dense and requires some background in maths/physics to understand it well. Could be better if it is extended to 5 - 6 weeks having more assignments.,4
90946,Vary nice! Practice and objectively!,5
90947,Best so far. Easy to follow and understand. Vijay is truly amazing at explaining difficult concepts in a way I could understand. Thanks to everyone involved.,5
90948,Excellent course. Provides a very good ground basis and it is very intuitive regarding applicability and practicability of the concepts learned at the course in real world.,5
90949,An excellent introduction to MAVs,5
90950,"So far the best course available online, almost research level. I have never done anything UAV, but I am a researcher for many years. I finish the material within 1 week (not full time). I assume it would be possible for average senior undergraduate student to finish with 4 weeks of intensive study.",5
90951,"Requires MATLAB. In my view, a university should not be promoting a proprietary product. There have been other Cousera courses which used Octave, the free-software implementation of the programming language implemented by MATLAB.I have seen no good reason why Octave should not have been used for this course.",1
90952,This is a well organized very informative course. I would highly recommend it.,5
90953,"could me much better , if the questions in the quiz can actually related to the lecture",4
90954,The videos doesn't tell anything related to the test. How can I know the answers? Am I going to search them on the internet? Then what the meaning to learn this course?,1
90955,awesome courseand an even more amazing university doing it.,5
90956,impressive work by the instructor,5
90957,I am really thankful to Coursera.org and University of Pensyllvania for providing me education in robotics. Its going to be a great experience studying with really great professors.,5
90958,I would only like this course better if it was longer and more in-depth. Excellent!,4
90959,"It was wonderful. I learned a lot. I am withdrawing because at age 71, I don't need to be writing research papers but just enjoying myself.",5
90960,"Most interesting to learn more about the leadershipof 3 Roosevelts in a century high economic growth, Great depression and 2 world wars. Excellent tutor, interesting interviews with specialists and quizes and demanding final essay. Many thanks for the opportunity to take the course. Beste Regards Ernst",5
90961,"This is a very interesting course focusing on the legacy of two US presidents and one wife of a president--Theodore, Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt. In particular, I enjoyed the attention given to the contributions of Eleanor Roosevelt during and after her husband's administration.",4
90962,I enjoy the interaction and interface scopes to really delve into a history and biography type course.,4
90963,"The lectures are too brief and do not go into details pertinent to the main theses of the course. While it is evident that each of the Roosevelts had a significant impact on their respective time in history, saying that it was a Rooseveltian century is going a bit too far. Nearly all the reforms that they initiated were countered by the end of the 20th century. Wagner-Pyser, Glass-Steagall were gutted by the end of the century and as for the UN we all know how in ineffective that has been at protecting human rights. The only thing that has lasted has been Social Security and that is under attack by a co-opted ultra-conservative Congres",2
90964,I enjoyed this class and learned a lot. The intervening research topics did not seem to be part of the grading for this course and I am not sure if anyone did them after the first one. The final peer assessment project just asked for a repeat of everything that had been said in the class since the final lecture went all the way up to Obamacare. There was no room to add anything to what the course had already said.,4
90965,"Some of this content is glaringly wrong e.g that F Roosevelt's freedoms weren't seen by him as inalienable rights, that culture and education were attributes of Eleanor's approach to freedom that were distinctive from FDR. One can go on and on ....",1
90966,A great American history course,5
90967,It was a nice course that touched on the different aspects of the Roosevelt presidencies.,5
90968,Great Course! Well presented with nice emphasis on selected themes in the 20th century.,5
90969,"excellent, do it again!plus have all students watch Ken Burns films on the three Roosevelts!",5
90970,"It was a good course, but maybe it could be better with more electronic topics.",4
90971,great course,5
90972,GENIAL MUY INTERESANTE,5
90973,It's really a great course for beginners.,5
90974,It´s very creative an show you how to use tone in digital information :),5
90975,I enrolled weeks ago and I found that the system has kicked me out the course. I accomplished some themes and now what? Do I need to start again? Also I have already paid for the certificate.. com,1
90976,Two days later and still no available.,1
90977,This course is the best in the world!!!,5
90978,"Really good course,you will find so much valuable information in it.Even the WebService module was like standalone course by itself.",5
90979,Very useful,5
90980,"Very great course, I get a lot of MongoDB and Mongoid knowledge. This course is hard for the new comer of Ruby on Rails and MongoDB. Assignment is a challenge job, sometimes assignment is a huge job. Suggest that better break down the assignment which over 30 pages. Maybe make this course from 4 weeks to 6 weeks, that is better.",4
90981,Very comprehensive insight into the topic,5
90982,"A most excellent course! I learned a lot more than I thought I would. My only comment is that the time estimates were way off for me -- I ended up spending up to four times as long as the estimate, on each week's assignment. But it was worth it.",5
90983,"I was excited to learn a bit about using document-based databases and JSON parsing and transport. However, for me the approach in this course was very dry and I found the material, goals, and teaching style to be a confusing jumble. It seemed like each section/module did not feel like a cohesive package, with each one building upon the last.",2
90984,"I just love Ruby on Rails, and this course is awesome!",5
90985,"I thought this course was really challenging and that made it worth it. I was expecting the course to just be ""here's another type of database, and here's how to use it in Rails"". But they went into all the features unique to Mongo. They showed things you can't do in ActiveRecord. The last project being an introduction to making APIs was great too. It really got me thinking about all the types of web apps I could make.",5
90986,"This is a great course. It is challenging, but that comes with the territory if you want to write code. I like the fact that the assignments are challenging and long; the only issue I had is that I work full-time and hardly have the 20+ hours a week to spend on the programming assignments. Also, the estimated times listed for each assignments are not realistic for somebody learning the topics in this course for the first time. I would recommend this course to anybody wanting to learn how to develop web apps and api web services using Rails with MongoDB as the backend. Just be prepared to dedicate a lot of time each week. Especially week3's assigment. I ran out of time and had to transfer to a new session to complete the course because of my full-time job. It would be beneficial for students to have a spare week, in between the third and fourth assignment.",5
90987,Very long assignment,3
90988,"Hard course but satisfying also. Practice exercises are quite long, and sometimes a little hard to read and understand (I say so as a non native english speaker)",4
90989,"This course was challenging, with a lot of new things to learn since MongoDB was used, first without a gem and the using it to really understand what we were doing. The staff is active and responsive! Thank you all!",5
90990,"This was a very challenging course, especially the programming assignments. However, it is very worthwhile.",5
90991,Poor alignment between assignments and lectures. Lots of content poorly explained.,1
90992,"The material was was too much for the estimated time given to spend on the course per week. The assignments are very lengthy and the grading doesn't always conform to what would be intuitive.Some gems used in the course material are also old versions. There are entries in the db seed data that cause trouble, leading to intensive debugging and modification of given files that require a much more experienced programmer to figure out.",2
90993,"I am a full-stack developer working mainly with Ruby on Rails.I took this course to learn about MongoDB and how it can be used with Rails, as well as to pick up certain aspects of Rails that I have not been using as much (like JBuilder)The materials and assignments are very detailed, which shows that a lot of effort has gone into them. Although some of the work turned out to be more time-consuming than expected, I enjoyed going through it and seeing the results.",5
90994,"Good course about NoSQL MongoDB. I learned a lot about the course but it would have been better if the instructor would have given some emphasis on programming with Unix machines like Macs. He used windows and in many cases I would run into problems like running Mongoid by including Gem files that he provided. I had to downgrade from rails 4 to 3 and then to 5, etc hitting StackOverflow every time to sort out technical issues.",3
90995,"At this point, after 3 courses, I can say that I am more then competent enough for great freelancing. I can only imagine how will my skill-set look after next two courses and final capstone project. Thanks a lot, JH Ruby team!",5
90996,"Overall good course with a lot of examples. Though, some important steps seems to be missing, so could not follow along with all the demos. Had to spend some unpredictable amount of time digging into some questions (probably, it is fine, but the difference between 2 previous courses and this one in the program is vivid). I had a problem installing 'doorkeeper-mongodb' and it does not seem that this problem for a number of users. Good that it was not in the final project.",3
90997,"I recommend this course to anyone who wants to start learning about document-oriented data model databases. It helped me a lot, since I have mostly worked with relational databases and I got curious about Mongodb.",5
90998,"It's a very course content, but level of difficulty is hard for an online training.",4
90999,Realy chalenging but useful,5
91000,"Is very cool course, with a lot of interesting thing, but definitly is not for inexperienced developers.",4
91001,One of my favorite courses in this specialization so far!,5
91002,Very good course! An in depth and comprehensive class on Rails + Mongo DB.Pros:- Topic explanations are short and on point- Homework and treated topics are closely relatedCons:- Homework debugging is slow on Windows- Sometimes it is necessary to read on extra material on line,4
91003,This course was a challenge. Mostly because some core requirements of the assignments were not explained in the lectures. I spent more time searching google for information than I did the lecture videos because A. the lecture videos are not named or indexed in such a way as to make it easy to figure out which video to rewatch and B. in many cases the particular thing I was trying to do wasn't covered at all. It may be the instructors teaching style to get you to research yourself but I could have done that without paying for the course.,3
91004,"Great course with a lot of practical work, that makes you not only know subject, but also feel it by the tops of your fingers.",5
91005,The course's assignments (3 so far) are not very well designed.It takes me more time to search online and on the lecture's videos for information than to actually write and come to a solution. The lecture's videos show very little coding and they're more focused on explaining (redundantly) a key concept.I believe it would be much more easier for other people taking this course later on if the videos were more code-oriented.Greetings.,3
91006,"I would give this course 0 stars if possible.I am amazed that anyone rated this course better than 1 or 2 stars!The lectures are not focused on the information that is necessary for the obnoxiously long and tedious assignments.The assignments are poorly written and demand too much Ruby expertise for a course meant for Ruby novices. I spent over 15 hrs trying to complete week 2's assignment and still could not finish. I became so frustrated and actually angry at how difficult this course is designed I decided to quit. Coursera should not allow there to be courses that evoke such frustration and emotion. John Hopkins should be embarrassed that their name is associated with the pedagogical malpractice that is this specialization series.Foolishly, I paid for the entire specialization up front and Coursera refuses to refund me for the remaining two courses. (which I have not even taken)",1
91007,Good contents but a bit over-complicated assignments.,2
91008,Great course! I'm really enjoying this specialization,5
91009,"Hi there, this course was great but i will recommend to split the large lectures in 2 and add more dynamic content and make the examples in rails project instead of the console will be great this course has been in the end a bit boring because i the professor need to be more fluid and make it more funny! for say it in some way for everything else it was a great course thanks you!",4
91010,Great way to learn about MongoDB and it's integration with Rails framework.,5
91011,Awesome course!! Thanks Coursera!!,5
91012,Not such a great course. Lectures don't cover what is needed in some assignments. Week 3 assignment was the hardest I ever took. Just plenty of work to be done and small amount of that work is going to stay with you. There is a lot of space to improve this course.,3
91013,"well done!all about i have to know about mongodb, but the assignment are too much time expensive for who have a job, like me",4
91014,"This course is a lot of hard work but, take hard work to become proffesional",5
91015,great course,5
91016,This class is very demanding but fun to learn!,4
91017,"Saps away a lot of time for beginners, but every hour spent is worth it! Best course so far in the specialization.",5
91018,"All the information and content given is great and necessary to work with mongo db. unfortunately, the timing and pacing is really tough because it relies on pretty long assignments. Take this course if you can handle going through 20 pages of instructions for a homework or 2, or you need a fast paced review of mongo and mongoid coupled with rails.",4
91019,"The layout of this course is extremely well reasoned out. Each module gives important stepping stones for the students both to understand and to get practical skills to use the material after the course. For me it was an extra bonus to learn about teh Rails API in the 4th week of the course. I will surely need that in the future. All assignments include very thorough guidance on how you can check your own work one step at a time all the way through. In fact I have never before attended a course where so much effort had been but into that part by the teachers. Much praise for that. The graded assignments were hard. I had to put in a quite considerable effort in each of them, especially week 3. Much more work than I had anticipated. However I cannot point to any part of the material that could easily have been left out. Everything we learned seemed useful and important. So in spite of the hard work I am happy that I stayed in there to the end.",5
91020,"This is definitely one of the best courses I have taken online.If you are interested in learning Rub on Rials with MongoDB,stop reading this comment and sign-up.",5
91021,"Nice course about rails and mongoid, awesome",5
91022,Unacceptable assignments length! The reason somebody would enroll to distance programme is due to personal high workload. It took me 2 weeks (not 6 hours as tutor mentions) to complete half of the second assignment and I am about to tell that I learnt nothing about MongoDB. The videos cover the very basics and in order somebody to complete the assignments needs searching in the internet. The videos must change to include more details about the presented topic.I am about to drop out of the specialization only because the specific course.,1
91023,"An unexpectedly disappointing, and in fact, downright awful course. The lectures waste a good share of time as in places they barely scratch the surface of what is further required to be implemented in the assignments. The assignments themselves inherit the nice modular spec-test driven spirit of the first two classes. However, the instructions are mostly quite vague or even misleading, occasionally dropping some “hints”, which are often either not helpful, or just offer to copy-paste a quarter page of code. The tasks are very (and by “very"" I mean EXTREMELY) long, tedious, boring to tears and to the point when you start to wonder if the authors are trolling the students. How about a 53 (yes, that is fifty three!) pages of assignment for the 3d week? To be fair, not all of this is the task statement, there is a lot of test code as well, but you know.. even one third of 53 is an impressive volume for a 4 weeks course (you get re-enrolled if you fail to be fair). Took me 44 hours of pure coding time (according to WakaTime) to finish the course. I have passed tens of courses on Coursera, and this one is by far the worst. That is taking into consideration that I would not rather call any other course (of those I have taken) “a bad one”. I suggest saving time and money by buying a book on Mongo and another one on Rails instead. I do believe though that the course is very green and certainly has to undergo some refinements and I will be happy to see future reviews shadow this one as obsolete.",2
91024,"Really great course, make me understand a lot about rest and HTTPGreat instructor!Congratulations",4
91025,course work is too hectic. its hard for some one who is new to web app development and new to ruby! but over all strength and content of the course is good.,5
91026,Thank you!,4
91027,The course is good but it's stupid to make course only in chinese language.,3
91028,It was a very effective course. I loved that the videos were made short and precise. This has helped me to start my social enterprise. I highly recommend this course to anyone who is planning to start their own social enterprise.,5
91029,"Highly recommend. Focused, practical and made me think. I have started applying concepts and tools right away. Thank you.",5
91030,Very good and detailed introduction for social entrepreneurship!,5
91031,Great course to gain an insight of the world of social entrepreneurship; gives you a solid framework to get your social enterprise started on the right footing. thanks,5
91032,I've chosen to give this course 4 stars. The videos were clear and thought provoking and both instructors were coherent and friendly.

91292,"Great teachers, Great materials, Very practical.",5
91293,"It's a mix of too much basic and irrelevant tips from different realms: pronounced english (which, in my opinion could be a great course of it's own), public speeking (only the basic of how to deliver which can be sum up to one page) and how to interact with other people (like how to say you are agree or disagree??? I strongly believe that if a person can understand those videos, I'm pretty sure that he knows that 5-years-old-extremly-basic-stuff).As much I like this concept of coursera, ""speak english professionally"" or even ""speak english"" is really a big statement for that course. Actually, from what it seems, the main point of that course is to get the students to purchase the full package of courses that the Georgia Tech Language Institude is offering. If you really like to know a great course that relates to the topic, I strongly advise you to check out the course ""Public Speaking"" by Dr. Matt McGarrity here at coursera. Best of luck.",1

I was looking for a course that would teach me how to write professional emails and have professional phone conversations, like which words I should use, what common sentences are or how to build up professional sentences. I am a bit disappointed and think this course was a waste of time for me.

91479,"I did all four courses - the whole specialization. Each course in itself was aright and I learned new things. However, the course certificate is meaningless. It neither states the content nor the effort (for example the hours). Instead, it even says ""non-credit course"". This is despite the fact that the course equates ""35 PDU's"" and ""counts towards the UCI Project Management Certificate Programm""; as it was described in the FAQ. I feel betrayed. How can I apply with such a meaningless peace of paper anywhere?",1

91508,"Attention: Margaret MaloneyHelloMy name is Sajid Mirza and I am taking the course on project management. I am really enjoying the course and it has been really a good experience.During the course I have noticed a typo error which if my understanding is correct, may please be modified. Details are as below:Introduction to Project Management, Lesson3 (Budget and scheduling week4, lesson 4.2), during the lesson at CPM: Duration and forward pass, section 3.23 the figure shows “EF” of activity “b” as 4 same as “LF’ of activity “a”, However, in the bonus video and in the PMBOK at page 176-177, it requires to add 1 in the EF of the successive activity. May please correct if my understanding is right.Thanks and RegardsSajid Mirza",5
91509,"It has not enough content, you can just read the chapters 5 to 7 of PMBOK, and its the textbook that you'll use in this course.",3
91510,"Helpful course to get a good understanding of budgeting and scheduling projects. Obviously, nothing trumps experience, however this course supported me in how to think about the budgeting and scheduling aspect of a project, and what are the key terms and ideas to keep in mind during that process.",4
91511,"Wonderful course. It was very well written with all major topics covered. Bonus video and Panelists Interview were also very helpful. However I would like to mention a small mistake in the week 4th's lesson, slide no. 3.23 has a network diagram, which has last activity written A instead of I. It changes the calculation for complete forward and backward pass. Also, Margaret explained the network forward and backward pass with the value of first day as 1. However in the lesson it was taken as 0, which again changes the formulas she described in the video. It's not difficult to understand the difference but it somehow breaks the harmony.",4

91564,I especially appreciated the detailed look at the Network diagram!!,5
91565,flash needed otherwise would have been 5 stars,4
91566,"That Course Was Awesome, Thank You :)",5
91567,Great course!,5
91568,Good and very informative,5
91569,This a well paced class which does a good job of breaking down the fundamentals of project management cost accounting.,3
91570,Great Course,5
91571,"In my opinion this is a very recommendable course. It's worth all the time one spend with it. The explanations are very good an also understandable for non-native english speakers.One gets ideas how to avoid pitfalls and, why some steps that are requested by the bosses at the very first moment (""how much, how long"") must not be answered before other steps (mainly WBS) is done.",5
91572,"Very interesting and insightful course, with practical information on projects scheduling. The instructor is increadibly engaging and cheerful making even the most hard things easy to understand.",5
91573,Excellent Course!!!Enjoyed learning since the beginning to the end.,5

91575,Extremely helpful course! Definitely recommend.,5
91576,Lot of external links,3
91577,"Nice course, Clears basic Concepts....",4
91578,It is better to merge the content of all 3 courses in one... very less content,3
91579,Loved the instructor... everything was made easily understood,5
91580,"Good, practical advice.",4
91581,Good training.,5
91582,Excellent practical knowledge covered.,5
91583,"I don't really like the format. I want lectures from the instructor, not animation and slides.",3
91584,Great course,5
91585,"Doing this course 'Budgeting and Scheduling projects' gives learners, a practical approach to Project management based on PMBOK methodology. Prof Margaret Meloni is a great teacher. Students will enjoy her crisp and clear communication of ideas. Slides are well designed. Video quality and sound quality is also great. You will encounter lots of good quality reading materials. Quizzes will help you to test your knowledge as you progress. Overall, an excellent course fit for project managers and project team members who work for construction projects. Also good for the aspiring project managers. Thanks to Prof Margaret and UC Irvine for the great course.",5
91586,"Great course, learnt a lot!!",5
91587,Basic introduction to databases.,5

91589,If you are looking for an entry into combination of Databases and Development this course is a great first step.,5
91590,"Love Dr.Chuck , leading me into Python programming and become a learner of Python programmer.Love these series of courses and I have complete these courses today. Thanks again to Dr.Chuck and faculty of course. It helps me a lot and I feel accomplishment. Looking forward for my new courses in relate courses(data science ).",5
91591,really useful,4
91592,"Thank you for the effort put in this course, I learnt alot",5
91593,great course,4
91594,Thank you for all your helping!!!,5
91595,"This course showed a lot of pre-written code and exposed me to databases. I learned a lot, but felt like I DID less than in the previous specialization courses.",3
91596,Good teaching by Dr Chuck.,4
91597,"Great instruction, made easy to understand powerful tools.",5
91598,Exceptional! the way even the most difficult concepts have been explained in such a simple way to be understood! Will definitely look forward to more courses from this professor!,5
91599,"Thank you, Dr. Chuck!!!!",5
91600,Very Good Teacher!,5
91601,"I think Chuck is easily one of the best instructors I have studied under and like the previous courses, he has been really good in this course as well; however, I think in the Week 5 lectures, he could have spent a bit more time to explain all the different concepts he has used/introduced in his programs, some of which he had explained previously but some of them are surely not covered before example the use codecs.open and when to use that and so on..there are other examples as well. Overall, the course is very well taught although the last assignment was just too easy and does not really test the knowledge and understanding of the subject.",4
91602,"Excellent course, thoroughly enjoyable!",5
91603,wonderful helped to organise data base.,5
91604,great course,5
91605,Learned a lot from this specialization. Thanks Dr. Chuck. Keep it up,5
91606,very knowlegeable,5
91607,"Cool class, I've learnt what I want to.",5
91608,"Good course, thank you Coursera",5
91609,Demos are quite helpful and lots of sample codes to play with,5
91610,Amazing and useful course,5
91611,Well explained. You could have also explained different types of joins. But i understand that is out of the scope of the course,5
91612,The concepts taught on the data modelling are very crisp and to the point. I really enjoyed the course.,5
91613,"Great course, pleasantly surprised I also learned a decent amount of SQL!",5
91614,Excellent course. Really loved the programming assignments as they were short and simple. Mainly focusing on the concepts learned. Instead of having to write the entire program from scratch. Prof provided us with the template which could be edited to practice and implement the concepts.,5
91615,Very interesting course.,4
91616,Its a good start to learn how to use python to store and retrieve data from database..,5
91617,"I love this course very much, as I get to learn the database , understand the usage of SQL, and the interaction between the python with relation database management. This is so awesome!!!",5
91618,One of the best course I have enrolled in. Also the best course for learning python.,5
91619,Very helpful in building a basic understanding of working with databases through Python.,4
91620,IT IS AWESOME. I'VE LEARNED A LOT FROM THIS. THX!,5
91621,nice and acceptable,5
91622,It was a very great experience to have this course. this has given me a lots of things to gain. I thanks to courser and group for p,4
91623,"easy to learn, Prof is so nice and cool !",4
91624,Good information and simple understanding.,5
91625,"This section is a little difficult, so maybe I need more time to familarize it, but anyway, it is still very useful! Thank you!",5
91626,This is an excellent course. I am looking forward to the capstone project.,5
91627,"Good content, excellent teacher.",5
91628,I work seemed a little too light.,3
91629,very good course,5
91630,Great course!,5
91631,Dr. Chuck has very detailed explanations for all codes and all mentors are very helpful as well. Recommend!,5
91632,"I felt that weeks 1-4 went at a reasonable pace, but the week 5 material was rushed. Those programs were written by the instructor and presented quickly as examples, but some of the content in the programs was not already known or presently explained, like the ""buffer"" built-in function (found in Chapter 3 of Dr. Chuck's book but not covered in the course) and the ""pass"" keyword, which I had to find in the Python reference manual for an explanation. The week 5 programs were quite advanced and I would have liked more time spent on explaining them and perhaps a related programming assignment or two to help us learn the material.",3
91633,"This is the only course in this specialization that doesn't seem to belong with the rest of the material. It seems out of place, and too little was done to relate it to learning python.Moreover, learning databases and SQL is easy; rather than taking up a whole course, this content could be relegated to one week of lectures in conjunction with some external references for further reading. Four weeks were spent on this external topic while the more interesting discussion on using python with databases is glossed over haphazardly in the last week.I am a big fan of this specialization and think Prof. Severance does a great job explaining some of the basics of python in a short amount of time, but this course needs to be restructured.",2
91634,Great course wish it was longer and had more assignments with writing code from scratch.,5
91635,"I have learned lots on Databases, SQL, Geocoding and data visualization. Great Course and Awesome Teacher!",5
91636,Brilliant!,5
91637,Perfect tutorial to work with database & Python,5
91638,"This was a very exciting course giving an insight into data modelling challenges, working with databases and visualization of data and showing smart ways of how Python can making our lives much easier by automating processes around databases. The course also covers the basic terminology of Object Orientated Programming making it a good liaison with what's been discussed in the previous lectures.",5
91639,"Excellent course and teacher! Please, do more courses!",5
91640,It's a great course with very interesting content and so many additional things worth learning and practicing more.,5
91641,I know that Dr. Chuck mentioned that he can't cover everything about databases and SQL. But I felt that the content could have been a bit more informative.Thanks a lot Dr. Chuck and the teaching staff.,4
91642,"Good course for brief understanding of databases, but not about using Python with databases",4
91643,Great Course to put everything together,5
91644,nice course with good information and helpful practice,5
91645,Outstanding course material prepared by a great instructor. I am looking forward to complete the entire series. 5-stars!,5
91646,"All the chapters have been well explained. However, the last chapter was a bit vague and needed deeper insight; especially the code used for data visualisation.Thanks Dr. Chuck!!!",4
91647,Would've liked for assignments to be more independent.,3
91648,"Great course, love this whole series.",5
91649,Enjoyed every lecture. Dr. Chuck does an excellent job in explaining the concepts covered. Not too challenging assignments were also key. The bonus videos are very inspiring to see all those really smart yet humble people talk about their work.,5
91650,Best Course on Python yet on the WebDr.Charles Severance knows the subject and makes it so easy!,5
91651,Really straight forward content and great overview of SQL + SQLite. Nice python demos. Sometimes the instructor wanders a bit before he gets to his point.,4
91652,I like the examples in the course. very helpful.,5
91653,Awesome class! Thank you Chuck!,5
91654,A very useful course,5
91655,This is a very helpful course for Python beginner like me. It gives me a brief picture of what Python can do.,5
91656,Thanks Coursera...Nice course and I have learned lot of stuff in this website.,5
91657,A very good Course for the beginners.,4
91658,"Great course, well explain and with good example. This is really an interesting course to learn about python with databases.",5
91659,Assignment codes should only be partially given.,4
91660,Great course! Awesome instructor! :D,5
91661,was expecting more on this.,3
91662,Dr. Chuck is awesome and so is this course,5
91663,Good introduction to using python with simple databases.,4
91664,"My favorite of the Python specialization so far. You learn databases and structure as well as how to interface with them with python and various API's and data structures common on the web today (xml, JSON). Love the lectures. Dr. Chuck does a fantastic job.",5
91665,great course！ love it！,5
91666,"I found the Python-SQL code could be explained better during first classes, while now some of the basics are explained well only in the final class. It is still an excellent course though.",5
91667,Great course with very detailed examples and a professor who knows how to properly teach a subject.,5
91668,Very good introduction to databases!,5
91669,"The assessment materials are not free？ I mean it is totally make sense that charge for certificates. But you cannot finish your courses completely if you cannot access the quiz. And the charges are soooo unbearably high for college students. Still, the teaching is excellent.",3
91670,"Great course! Dr. Severance really put a lot of thought and effort into his videos and assignments.This course took a big leap, in terms of program complexity, from the prior courses in the series. This course could have been twice as long, and dug deeper into the details.",4
91671,Thanks to Dr. Charles Severance,5
91672,"A bit more actual programming would be good rather than minor tweeking of existing code. Overall, a good basic into to relational database with Python.",4
91673,"The best ever course, Dr Charles is at his best and I would recommend this course to everyone who wants to start learning Python. I have gained confidence over Python.Thank you sir for a clear explanation of all the things, and I would definitely go through the videos multiple times in case I have any questions.",5
91674,"Simple and direct, homework is well-organized, great course",5
91675,"Dr. Chuck is very knowledgeable and clearly passionate about ensuring that everybody know how to program. Further to this, the information that was provided in this course, along with the specialization's accompanying courses, gave me enough knowledge to begin my own venture into scraping, cleaning and storing web content. Add this to the University of Michigan's specialization in Data Science and you'll definitely have solid foundational knowledge of how to collect, manipulate and analyze digital data.",5
91676,The assignments can be more challenged,4
91677,Dr. Chuck does it again.,5
91678,The course is nicely covers the DB concepts and prepared with excellent exercises.,5
91679,Great course for beginners using Databases with Python,5
91680,Great!,5
91681,"Charging for free content, really?? Go fuck yourselves",1
91682,"Nice class, easy to follow and clear concepts",5
91683,Good course.But skips to topics without any brief introduction,5
91684,Excellent Course for all Pythonistas who want to get good practical knowledge of using Databases with Python!,5
91685,Great introduction to using Python for setting up and maintaining sqllite databases.,5
91686,"Nice course, as good as the others that gives the great Charles Severance!!",5
91687,I think it can further explore the libraries and constructs of the algorithms.,3
91688,I absolutely love these lecture series... the material is well selected and has a good set of practical solutions.,5
91689,Top one,5
91690,"I feel that this portion of this course did move a little too quickly in terms of introducing new SQL concepts. The first couple Python program demos has my head completely spinning, and I think this could be largely avoided by having a couple more slides piecing together the logic of the programs. Other than that, another great course!",3
91691,This course is very great!,5
91692,"Great introductory course, I would recommend anyone beginning with Python to start here.",5
91693,Clear and helpful. Assignment could be more difficult,5
91694,Very useful!,5
91695,Great introduction to Databases!,5
91696,I felt in love with Python during the course :),5
91697,"Great teacher, very good learning material!",5
91698,I enjoyed this course and look forward to using what I've learned at work.,5
91699,Amazing and very knowledgeable Dr. Chuk. I wish the lectures could have been a little more detailed and we could have more practice assignment.,5
91700,"Good class for new comers, and in order to be professional, you need to learn more about it.",4
91701,"This was another superb course!! However I'd still suggest the following to make it even more complete:1) Please also show how to connect/operate with other DBMS like Oracle, MySQL using Python (at least briefly).2) Please delve a little deeper into OOP topics in Python, it looked a bit cut-short.",5
91702,"Dr Chuck has covered basics of relational database as well in this course where i learnt how to model a database from the available data we have .He has also successfully covered different ways to extract data from files (html,xml,json) and dump into database as well as pulll from database and write into file in specific format.",5
91703,assignment difficulty level should be increased...,4
91704,"By far one of the most complete Python courses. You go from someone who understand nothing (or just a few things) about Python and, in case you continue, end with enough knowledge to come up with your own ideas and solutions.",5
91705,The Course was very resourceful and easy to understand.,5
91706,thanks,5
91707,"Excellent Course, but I would have liked more exercise and design process",4
91708,Very nice course. programatic and easy to learn,5
91709,great as always!,5
91710,"Still absolutely awesome program. Only two comments. I understand it's probably necessary, but I didn't like relying on code I didn't understand - I don't like the ""take it on faith"". Other is that I liked the old video approach in which both Dr. Chuck and the code were visible simultaneously, rather than alternating between. Otherwise a really important course to make available to everybody. Thanks -",5
91711,Excellent Course. learned a lot. Thanks Dr. Chuck,5
91712,"Unlike the other courses, the material was quite new. And the videos were shorter than the first one. The assignments were also quite simple too",4
91713,Love this course! A thoughtful introduction to using python with databases. A great way to learn the basics of object oriented programming and databases. Dr. Chuck explains everything clearly and I like the way he gradually builds upon previous knowledge to explain each new layer of information.,5
91714,Just perfect!,5
91715,"Good course at an appropriate level. I'd like to see more advanced topics in a related course, like optimization, multi-threading, database management. Some discussion of non-relational databases would also make sense.",4
91716,Great Course,5
91717,Assignments were way too simplistic,3
91718,Excellent class for learning how to make and analyze databases with Python.,5
91719,NOT COVERED IN DEPTH..JUST OVERVIEW,4
91720,Simple and Easy,5
91721,Excellent Class! Learned a lot that I will be able to apply to my job.,5
91722,The way dr chuck take us through all the material is quite fascinating and really enjoyed him through all way.,4
91723,"Thanks, good course",5
91724,"Maybe, it will be useful to add more theory about 3 normal forms?Thank for awesome database introduction. I've had lack of practice with 3 normal forms, but you fixed it.",4
91725,I liked it very much,5
91726,Very good course and Dr. Chuck is a great teacher,5
91727,"Very well organized, great course materials (small modules and simple enough to understand),thoroughly explained in video lectures, but tasks need to specify more on what it is that's expected of participant to do. Also, very much like the history lectures and would like more of those as well as the more practical ones.",5
91728,"a bit too easy, especially the assignments.",4
91729,"This course gives a great introduction to SQL and how it can be used inside of Python for communicating with Databases. The pace is good and the exercises are explained well, though the quizzes can be a bit more difficult. Final exercise was good, but I think it can be more challenging by giving less suggestions how to do something and by giving more independence to students. Overall, the course was awesome and I learned a lot.",5
91730,The best course(so far) in this specialization series.,5
91731,great set of courses and specializationvery well laid out intro to Python,5
91732,An amazing course that concludes the Python set nicely. Dr Chuck does an excellent job and his textbook adds considerably to the convenience. The test questions and programming exercises are thought out well. They help to consolidate the material nicely without having to spend tens of hours but at the same time requiring some thought. Highly recommended.,5
91733,This is an Excellent course..!!,5
91734,"Given that Python 2 was replaced by Python 3 some 6 years ago, I'm dismayed to see that this class is teaching Python 2 instead of Python 3.",1
91735,"Never thought i'd finish the 1st, 2nd, 3rd course, coz its programming - boring.... guess what? 4th course done!!! Dr. Chuck is the man! this course is not only fun but addictive!",5
91736,Great,5
91737,Amazing course. The instructor is amazing! I strongly recommend to anyone.,5
91738,I enjoyed learning Python with Database,4
91739,Dr. Chuck is very good at teaching the concepts and makes the lectures interesting.,5
91740,good course,5
91741,"Solid foundational database concepts in Python if you're looking to learn the basics or brush up on fundamentals. However, if you're looking for more advanced topics, you might want to look at more advanced classes.",4
91742,"Great course for beginners, amazing instructor.",5
91743,Good Course,4
91744,Good course,5
91745,Very understandable explanation and course materials supports. Great course and awesome teacher!,5
91746,"Dr. Charles makes these modules much more interesting than I have ever seen before. I am a Masters graduate from a reputed university, which is one among top 10 in the world, but I can strongly say that Dr. Charles is something different and I would love to study forever under him.The way he connects technology to real world is something fantastic.",5
91747,Great to get into python network programming,5
91748,Very good intro to sql language and retrieving GeoData. It's really easy data management with python and sqlite and manage jason format data. Geolocation is a very good example,5
91749,"Assignments are too much spoon feeded, rest is too good.",5
91750,"Very Good ,and Suitable for start in programming",5
91751,really useful and interesting course,5
91752,Great course! Dr Chuck does a great job communicating the course content in a way that keeps me engaged. The exercis,5
91753,great introduction to relational databases with python,5
91754,Gradual improvements are being made and the practices give you encouragement to do more.,5
91755,Great class! Thank you! :),5
91756,"Simple and useful, rery well！",5
91757,good class,5
91758,Good overview. Needs to include more hands on development. 1 star because Coursera wont let me take the capstone even after completing all four pre-requisite classes (this one is the fourth).,1
91759,not too many new things about Python. mostly introduction to Python capabilities in databases/overall pretty good class.,3
91760,Great stuff,5
91761,Excellent course and the way Dr. Charles explains is just amazing and awesome,5
91762,Excellent course with magnificent exercises. Loved to solve them,5
91763,Great course,5
91764,Thanks Dr Chuck. It has been a very fun learning experience.,4
91765,It's a very good lecture.,5
91766,Hats off ! Prof. Charles,5
91767,very good and interesting module which help me relate to line of work,4
91768,Geat!,5
91769,clear and impressed. Thank you professor.,5
91770,It's better to use Python 3 version.,4
91771,Really helpful and I love it,5
91772,Great!,5
91773,A well thought out course with material progressively advancing at a pace that challenges but does not discourage.,5
91774,Awesome course! Learned useful tools for databases and programming.,5
91775,Content are good for basic learner to connect with sqlite database and good knowledge about basic sql queries,5
91776,Great class and Dr. Chuck makes it as fun as can be while keeping it informative. Also the class touches on just enough material so one can learn independent of the course work so you can expand your Python toolbox.,5
91777,It's easy to understand the concepts of database and the relationships between packages of software. The programme which provided for starting is very impressive.,5
91778,Just awesome!,5
91779,"Teacher was good, but the hand in assignments were much too simple. They didn't challenge me, and I didn't really get to practice the new things we've learned. All assignments were just about copy/paste 3-4 lines in existing code, and make a minor change to it.",4
91780,Greate Course!,5
91781,Easy to understand all concepts and gives keys to start developping.,5
91782,Good courses because It's not difficult and basic. Thank you,5
91783,Great information but the homework is a little to easy and I don't think I was able to comprehend it that well.,4
91784,"Thanks, Dr. Charles, a very interesting course!",5
91785,Great course. Awesome way to get started in databases. Should be more hands on on the Python part,4
91786,cool,5
91787,Excellent course :) Really enjoyed it!!!,4
91788,Very good course . You will get a clear concept of databases .,5
91789,thanks.,5
91790,Very useful and helpful course.Thanks to all the study mates!,5
91791,"I've learned so much about the functional operations of a database and have already implemented changes in my day-to-day work. While my focus is on Python for now, I feel that some additional courses or information on ""best practices"" of Database Models and Architecture. Even in this short class, there are so many great note taking moments.",5
91792,Not so much hands-on work in this course.Give us more homework please! ;-),3
91793,"This is a very good course, but probably more SQL will make it even better.",4
91794,Another great course from Dr. Chuck. Thanks.,5
91795,Very clear and friendly lectures.,5
91796,Great!,5
91797,Excellent content and instructions. Fun to learn!,5
91798,This course was absolutely gorgeous in showing students what is possible when connecting powerful language like python with databases using SQL. Great stuff!,5
91799,"The course is amazing, the professor gives you right examples an amount of information for understanding the topics. After you finish the course you are not an expert but you have the right concepts and knowledge for developing your projects. Furthermore, the additional material (interviews) are pretty interesting. I audit the course but I did all the homework, you must do the homework to really understand the topics.",5
91800,Still needs more practise,4
91801,"This works really well for an introduction on databases and how to use them with Python. The exercises are maybe a bit too easy. On the one hand, this makes it easy to actually complete the course (and you still learn the basics), but on the other hand, you don't get that familiar with the material.The lecturer is intelligent and funny and structured.",4
91802,Great cours.,5
91803,Great job by the Dr. Chuck and the staff,5
91804,Good course. I just expected my last assignment to be more challenging. But with the examples given we can create challenges for ourselves on real life projects.,4
91805,Great courses! Challenging but rewarding!,5
91806,This course really helped me to understand and learn how to use database,5
91807,Nice Course. Learnt a lot. Thanks to the instructors..,5
91808,Really good course. Clear discussion of databases and how they are used.,4
91809,"Excellent course, and the additional video material was entertaining and informative",5
91810,"Although the theory was getting denser, we passed through it too quickly, and the assessments were too light. Even though the aim is to have students investigate and go deeper by themselves, I think we should have been prompted to do some further development.",4
91811,A surface level look into creating a SQL database with Python. Skims over topics quickly and does not go into depth on how to write code effectively or build a database from scratch.,3
91812,very good and useful course. 100% recommended,5
91813,Thanks Dr. Chuck for making me learn how to handle DBs with python scripts.Thanks for your time.Highly recommended.,5
91814,Great python course for beginners!,5
91815,Great course! Very practical lesson plan with relevant assignments.,5
91816,"This course felt a bit easy, but it was probably because I have worked with databases quite a bit already. Very useful. Great intro to databases and how to use Python with them.",5
91817,"awesome part, my favorite of the first previous, but the Assessments are not challenging",5
91818,"excellent course, I may consider general aspects for BD consult with Python. Thank you.",5
91819,This course is amazing,5
91820,Really was a excellent section that gave a clear understanding of databases and database management.,5
91821,"awesome, very good explainded, and very enjoyable",4
91822,"The Teacher made me thirsty of more work. Especially in the last chapter, I was looking for more challenging work. The way the assignment was designed and the topics were taught made me think, the assignment for the last week was quite easier and I was expecting something more challenging. This proves the beauty of this class. I wish I have a trainer like this always with me, at least as long as I cannot go out and look for work myself.Thanks a million to Dr. Charles Severance. This is a very positive experience.",5
91823,Fantastic introduction to the world of databases. Engaging video tutor and interesting examples of database usage.,5
91824,"This course is as awesome as the other ones in the series. I love the way things from all the courses(SQL, accessing data from web API's etc.) merges together in the end. This course complements the others and the series as a whole teaches one enough to develop some useful programs.I wish there were more of coding exercises rather than just code completion. Overall, a great learning experience with Dr. Chuck, the Pythonista.",5
91825,The course is really interesting.,5
91826,Fantastic course as always from the legendary Dr Chuck,5
91827,Good course for learning sql database basics,5
91828,This course has been very useful to my work.,5
91829,Great and lovely course,5
91830,This is a wonderful course for anybody to ramp up their programming skills right from scratch. This gives enough confidence to take on further programming tasks.,5
91831,The lecturer is honestly a bit slow in his coverage of content and his scribbling is untidy. He also seems to want to intentionally make SQL look like its very simple and avoids giving interesting facts which he thinks may complicate the content but would be good to know anyway.,3
91832,Very nice and helpful course. Awesome instructor.,5
91833,Great course for starting working with DB in python. Good portion of theory and practice.,5
91834,Very good course!,5
91835,Chuck is awesome!!!,5
91836,Cheerful and Happy Course. Thank You Coursera,5
91837,That was great!,5
91838,"Excellent course. Thank you very much, Dr. Chuck. I will remember you as my programming guru FOREVER!",5
91839,Great elaboration and elegant quiz/assignment design - learned a lot!,5
91840,Chuck is one of the funniest tutors I've ever listened. The course was always entertaining despite their length and content.,5
91841,"Excellent course! Maybe It would be better to center in some points of the examples instead of providing so many, but in any case, a recommended course.",4
91842,Great course! This is a very good introduction to the value of databases and database management using SQLite.,5
91843,"Excellent course. It could be more challenging, but it is still a fun, well-delivered and well-balanced course that benefits the beginner as well as the novice. Dr. Chuck is great and very engaging. Looking forward to the capstone.",5
91844,Very helpful.,5
91845,I like the worked examples that are always provided and explained,5
91846,"Excellent course. Thanks Coursera, Thanks Dr Chuck.",5
91847,Thanks,5
91848,Useful info. Now we start to get some Python super powers,4
91849,"Fantastic course! Thank you so much to Dr Chuck, you have done a great job of creating this course, and making it accessible, educational and entertaining at the same time!Thank you s much and I do hope you go on to make more coursesThank you",5
91850,Great exercises. The learning curve for API's was significantly reduced by Dr. Severance.,5
91851,"People use Python for many purposes: to make games, build web services, to solve business problems, to work with sensors, drivers and robots. Python is also used heavily in scientific fields for academic research and applied work.Python is an incredibly efficient language: your programs will do more in fewer lines of code than many other languages would require.Py4inf and Python explained by C. Servance, is a great developing of the foundations in programming (first two courses) that will serve you well for the rest of your life, as well as a course that will give you a sort of try to understanding of what great things python can do for you.I strongly recommend this course for anybody, who wants to start with informatics.",5
91852,Very useful and well organized! Thanks so much!!,5
91853,Excellent introduction to databases. The tests need to be a bit challenging!,4
91854,"Great teacher, nice range of topics, very well explained. Unfortunately assignments are trivial and boring. Anyway worth taking along with other courses from that specialization.",3
91855,Wonderful Course! Loved it!,5
91856,Nice done as always,4
91857,Learned a lot,4
91858,The difficulty level of the assignments could be increased !,4
91859,Thoroughly enjoyable and Dr Chuck has a great teaching style,5
91860,Excelent course with great examples!,5
91861,pretty good,5
91862,"I felt that more time could have been spent going over the python code in the last section. The code was made available, and it is up to the students to review the code at their own pace. This is good. It may further help to go over the code in the video lectures themselves.",4
91863,"Loved this course! Dr. Chuck makes it fun by adding the bonus material - office hours videos as well as the fantastic interviews with all the computing greats whose work we've used so far but haven't had any chance to interact. The course itself is great at explaining tricky topics including web architectures involving crawlers, search engines, data wrangling code etc. without turning off new learners.The sql/ rdbms part eases learners into using DRI with without the actual declarations rather inserts and updates, but this is so vital a concept for databases that there could possibly be some bonus video explaining this with a little bit more rigor (as sqlite does support foreign key references). Nevertherless a great course keeping in mind that it primarily deals with programming in python rather than db code.",5
91864,"I like this series a lot. I didn't like that the last assignment is peer graded though, because now I have to wait for somebody to see my assignment and grade it... :( but otherwise, this was fun and a good introduction to working with databases! I learned a lot.",4
91865,"I hope this can be a little bit more challenge. All the assignments are easy to be finished, some of them can be done within minutes. Comparing with JHU's R programming, that can be too hard, though.",4
91866,"Very good, felt like we could have done more work with hands on file writing and coding but it was nice to build off of someone elses.",4
91867,Nice course and nice teacher.Can dr.chuck come to Taiwan? : ),5
91868,"It's my honor to complete this course and its followings. Thank you,Professor Severance, for your detailed explanation and hilarious touch. And above all, thank you, Coursera, for providing such a great chance for all the students around the world, including me, a college student from China,which the access to the top courses of top universities.",5
91869,There is not enough exercise.,3
91870,Dr. Chuck is the best,5
91871,Many thanks for authors!!!,5
91872,cool,5
91873,"a good introduction to how to interact with database.If you want to grasp more deeply,you 'd better read the free book--python for infomatics(3rd edition).",4
91874,dr.Chuck is the best,5
91875,"Definitely learned new skills on this course. Dr. Chuck is knowledgeable, engaging and a very skilled teacher, which made for an enjoyable lecture series. Looming forward to the Capstone now!",5
91876,It was interesting to have introduction with SQL by Charles Severanse. I think the course is efficient and full. I'll be glad to learn Python with Dr. further.,5
91877,"This course give you an introduction to SQL and database, after finishing this, you will be able to handle the database by python.",5
91878,Very useful course in Coursera.,5
91879,A great introduction into SQL,5
91880,Very nice course. It was great the material dug a little deeper into the ideas needed to use python to access data from the web!,5
91881,"Dr. Chuck does a great job overing all the basics and providing resources needed to dive deeper. The book is extremely useful, as were his videos and code examples. After completion, a student should be able to connect to a database and perform useful work. The course has high value, as the skills learned can be applied immediately.",5
91882,This one was dense! So much information on databases and SQL. Final multi-step applications were very well chosen and introduced so much new elements.,5
91883,One of the best courses of the whole specialization.,5
91884,Assignments were too easy :(,4
91885,Great course indeed!,5
91886,Great course I would like to learn a little bit more on how the Javascript visualization is generated,5
91887,"Best of the best. Great instructor and materials. I finished all 4 classes of the series, which tells you how much I enjoy learning from this instructor.",5
91888,"If Dr. Chuck is teaching the course, then I'm taking the course!",5
91889,Excellent introduction to databases and how to use Python to access them,5
91890,It seemed to me a little bit too superficial... It was almost only copying and pasting code...,3
91891,Great Course.. Really helpful...,5
91892,Very helpful and give new insights that lead to a better understanding of Python and its strengths,5
91893,I think the assignment should be more difficult!,5
91894,one of the best courses i've ever heard.,5
91895,An enjoyable presentation of this topic. Gives a decent overview without going into depth. Charles is a great teacher.,4
91896,Excellent. This and the other Python for Informatics classes have taught me a lot as I've started my journey with Python.,5
91897,Huge thanks.,5
91898,Awsome!,5
91899,"This course cut away a bit from the Python-only track and ventured into beginner SQL territory, which was an excellent choice. In this course the pieces really started to come together. I was expecting a bit more difficult exercises, though!",5
91900,Dr. Chuck is a gifted teacher. Loved the course.,5
91901,Awesome Learning !!,5
91902,Great,5
91903,Excellent course and excellent teacher. Professor Charles is a teacher of excellence.,5
91904,SQLITE3 is powerful!,5
91905,Well Structured and presented,5
91906,It is a very instructive course.,5
91907,"Beginning was a bit rough but once you get into the mindset, the video lectures and assignments come together very easily.",5
91908,"I really love Dr. Chuck and I think he is really famous in Michigan! But I may think the content of the courses is a little simple and homework is not so hard enough. In my perspective, maybe the course can get better if we learn more deeply and homework can be tougher. Anyway, hope to meet Dr. Chuck in Michigan! My e-mail is lxtian@umich.edu",5
91909,Thank you Dr. Chuck!,5
91910,Thank you for 4 great courses!,5
91911,Very Cool!,5
91912,Just great!,5

91915,Awesome course ..,5
91916,"Amazing Course, all the package!",5
91917,"Being the last course in Python for Everybody Specialization, I expected this course to be somewhat harder than others, but it turned out to be just opposite. Maybe because I had some prior knowledge about SQL and database administration.Excellent work and effort by Professor Charles Severance and the teaching stuff.",5
91918,"I liked the course. As with the previous three courses, Dr. Severance does a great job presenting the material and explaining how the code works. I felt that the assignments and the book were lacking a little bit:1. The textbook needs to be updated to include the Object Oriented Programming section that is covered in Week 1.2. There is no programming exercise for the OOP section, just a quiz.3. There are no assignments in the textbook for Chapters 14 and 15. The examples of the code and how it works is awesome, though, which is a trade off of sorts.4. The Chapter 14 programming assignments only require minimal programming in Python and/or SQL. I would have liked to do a little more programming.5. Chapter 15 felt like it was shoved in at the end, and the assignment was really easy. I was hoping for a little more rigor on that one, also.Overall, it was a good experience and I'm looking forward to finishing up this specialization when the Capstone is unlocked and becomes available.",4
91919,The course is awesome. Just completed it.Excited about the Capstone.,5
91920,"Excellent course, loved learning new stuff.",5
91921,it's easy for me to learn python with database,5
91922,"useful, but could be more challenging",5
91923,Good Course but slightly schizophrenic due to the object oriented topics. Don't feel that they belong in this course and would be really ticked off if paid for it.,4
91924,"I can honestly say (as a person with a Master's in Computer Science ... so I have taken ALOT of CS related classes and courses while in industry), Dr. Chuck is one of THE best professors/teachers out there. Thanks for everything!",5
91925,Could dive a little bit further into the topic,4
91926,"Very good course, it's worth trying!",5
91927,Perfect course,5
91928,The most useful one for me in the specialization.,5
91929,"I realy enjoyed this course , thank you",5
91930,Excellent Course Coverage & Delivery,5
91931,Its a great course for utilizing databases and related content with the power of python... :),5
91932,"Nice course with detail exampleHomework is easy, if student pay attention to the code, they will learn a lot",5
91933,"Nice course, but it needs stronger assignments.",4
91934,"Very good as always, I have taken a lot of online courses, Charles is a good teacher/ professor, that explains exactly what is needed very well and doesn't overcomplicate concepts. If you pay full attention to his videos, exercises are very easy as well.",5
91935,"When I started this course I didn't know what Python can do. But now, this final course revealed the power of Python used for Database. Thank you Dr. Chuck for taking me in this adventure!",5
91936,Would recommend to people who want to know more about how databases work.,5
91937,Excellent intro course with a great instructor. Highly recommend.,5
91938,best teacher ever. thank you chuck,5
91939,"good stuff. later sessions should mention ETL https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load",5
91940,"A good introduction to the basics of SQL and an excellent, intuitive description of the workings of databases with motivations for them. Gets a little 'hand-wavy' at parts but is fine for a less experienced programmer.",4
91941,The class is interesting and good teacher,5
91942,"I am very happy, that I took this course. Thank you, dr. Chuck!",5
91943,"The teacher was wonderful as always. The course is given with sqllite, I would have liked a bit more experience with raw SQL queries. But the course shows you how to create and manage your databases with Python in an efficient way.",3
91944,A great start with python data visualization and analysis using databases,5
91945,"Dr Chuck is an excellent teacher. His examples are clear, his methods are exemplary, his style is engaging.This course was listed as Beginner Level and it certainly met that expectation.Now, if he would only teach an Intermediate course on SQL and Python with more challenging examples, then I'd sign up right now!",5
91946,Excellent - but I wish that the course had tougher assignments to really push me to practice on the topic - although I admit this is hard to grade.,4
91947,great course,5
91948,I enjoyed the course very much.,5
91949,I can learn some SQL techniques in this course. And an interesting map application is really useful.,5

91960,"Great course, learned allot",5
91961,The course should have more details. It feels like a lot was skipped.,3
91962,Finished,5
91963,"Excellent course, gives you the basics of handling databases with SQL and Python",5
91964,Enjoyed all the classes. Looking forward to the Capstone.,5
91965,perfect! The professor teach us in a way that give us a lot of fun.,5
91966,"This class was phenomenal. As hard as all the code was, Dr.Chuck made the experience enjoyable and humorous. I would recommend this class to anyone who has all the background knowledge needed to succeed in this class.",5
91967,Touches on a lot of subjects. Each having its own complexity. I'd have loved of the concepts are covered in a little more depth.,4
91968,"Great course! This is a fantastic introduction into creating and working with databases with Python; providing ample examples and explanation, as well as useful links to resources that offer greater depth if you so chose. Looking forward to learning with you again, Prof. Chuck!",5
91969,"Excelent course, simple enough to grasp the basics on SQL and advanced to understand how to apply them in application development .",5
91970,"As great as previous coursers in this specialization. Very good materials, perfectly explained and for once the slides and videos are even better than book (SQL part).",5

91992,Really helpful and good one...,5
91993,It have low practice exercises.,3
91994,"Again another good course by one of your instructor, Mr. Severance.I like to attend course where there is fun and passion and this is quite usual with him. I understand the choice of sqlite over fully fledged sql server: simple and widely available. I was tempted to give 4 stars because of it but I can see that it will add unnecessary and misleading complexity since the course is about Python mostly.",5
91995,"Professor Chuck have continued his brilliant course series right up to the final lecture, I thoroughly enjoyed it. The lessons and assignments were one of the best. Thanks for making this journey so incredible. On to the capstone now ... !!",5
91996,I would have liked to write more Python code to interact with the databases during the course of the homework assignments. The lectures were VERY good.,4
91997,I think this one is a little bit too easy. It's better if the Professor asks us to do more instead of providing all the code.,5
91998,too simple TT,4
91999,Great instructor,5
92000,The sample codes given for this class are very useful,5
92001,Provide good introduction for database operation via Python,5
92002,Overall pretty good. The assignments didn't require much effort or understanding to complete.,4
92003,The course and the lectures are very good. But the assignments are bit to easy and hence its easy to pass without putting in the effort really learning what taught.,4
92004,A very useful and interesting course about python and databases.,5
92005,"This is perfect course,",5
92006,"Short, but jam packed with stuff you need to know in order to get working with Databases. The ending lesson was a little disappointing as we weren't tested on how to do some of the suggested projects that the teacher was talking about and instead only had to download and run a program on our computer. However, this class equips you with the knowledge to get a start in Data Science and Database engineering, as well as good practice and better understanding of how to use Python.",4
92007,One of the best (if not THE best) teachers out there...,5
92008,Dr Chuck is an amazing and inspirational teacher I cannot reccommend this course highly enough I have enjoyed every moment of it. Thank you sir for everything you have done to bring education to the masses.,5
92009,Very nice. Some of the theoretical quizes were too detailed - the coding could have a little bit more challenges,5
92010,Very good and interesting course.,4
92011,Interesting,5
92012,Great course! Very good in order to get used to using sqlite with Python.,5

92016,"Great professor, great class",5
92017,"There is no other option but to give ""5 stars"" to dr. Chuck's db's & python. Glad I could participate at. A highly recommended for everyone wishing to receive some insight into sql-like db's from pythonic perspective. Funny and insightful - just perfect.",5
92018,"Dr. Charles Severance is by far the best Computer Science professor out there!!! I've done a significant amount of online Computer Science courses -as well as classroom courses back in college - and not one professor has been as fun and easy to understand as Chuck. He puts presents every topic in such a way that you're never scared off thinking ""i'll never understand this stuff."" He make computers and everything technical make sense. I've basically binge-watched almost every lecture/course he's headed up.I never knew how vital it was to understand Database development. I also thought it would be outside of my realm of knowledge but now all i want to do is build databases to analyse. He makes it so easy to comprehend. I always thought i was Python was for wanna-be programmers but now i'm proud to say Python is my language of choice. SQL scared the hell out of me before i took this course. Now it's my first stop when i'm planning to develop a new model.He makes learning fun and seems like he's be a really fun guy to get to hang with. Thanks Dr. Chuck for your love of teaching, you're the best!",5
92019,The course is good but the Content can be improved and enriched. It shall be deeper 'cause databases are a very important t,4
92020,"The course was informative and some of the material regarding databases will be useful towards my current job. However, I felt that in classes 3 and 4, Python was really an after thought. I believe I could have completed this course without ever taking the first two classes because the assignments only required slight modifications to existing code. I was more analyzing patterns rather then truly understanding the code. I would rather see the course continue to expand upon basic programing knowledge so that I can write the code by myself instead of seeking examples to cut/paste all the time.",2
92021,"Assignments are very easy, and there aren't easy to follow notes that one can use instead of always having to watch the videos.",3
92022,quit useful and good for beginner,4
92023,"Thank you so much. The course was great and I learned a lot of brand new and useful stuff. Best from Kenneth, Denmark",5
92024,"Topics covered are great, but there is a lack of assignments to be done by students completely on themselves.",4
92025,"This is an excellent course. It wasn't easy, but do-able for people who have had no other Python experiences other than the other courses by Dr. Chuck.",5
92026,Loved it! As always really interesting and encouraging. And special thanks for keeping courses free! This is rare nowadays even when the platform consider itself as free :-/,5
92027,This is a great course for anyone interested in learning how to use Python to gather data from the web. Dr. Chuck is a fantastic teacher!,5
92028,"It's OK. the lectures are good. The book needs updating, and more exercises would be helpful to practice what we learned in class.",3
92029,"Interesting, clear & useful",5
92030,Content is well set and delivered.,5
92031,Very informative. Need more assignments/problems to consolidate learning,4
92032,"well designed class especially the homework. by going through all the homework, i have dramatically improved my python data extraction and database management skills. Great introduction course!",5
92033,"If you don't know nothing about databases then this is the best way to start.You are going to learn SQLite which is a cool way to organize data like for example your music CDs track records, or your phone book.And the coolest part is Python can use it to get data and work with it.",5
92034,Great introduction to databases,5
92035,I used SAS a lot to manage databases. This course is very useful to me.,5
92036,"Awesome stuff. Useful things covered, but the student should be able to be tested in creating himself code, not just run or (simple( edit the existing code.",3
92037,I think the course excellent to analysis,5
92038,"Things are way to deep for not programmers, i did not enjoyed so much as the previous",3
92039,Great quality lessons.,5
92040,Great course!,5
92041,Another mind-opening course from Dr. Chuck. I really enjoyed it. I would like to recommend to everyone who wants to leverage their skill in Python programming.,4
92042,"I like this course very much, because before it I didn't know databases.",5
92043,Challenging and engaging with loads of additional resources and a really cool lecturer.,5
92044,Great Course,5
92045,I think everyone should take course,5
92046,Very interesting topic but enough practical exercises,4
92047,"Great about python and database, including JSON and XML format deal.",5
92048,Nice course but didn't include enough python code for other database vendors and wasn't challenging enough,3
92049,"Thank you, Dr. Severance and the Coursera team. This was a great course on using databases with Python!",5
92050,Great,5
92051,"Great course, really helpful lectures on the intregration of SQL / relational databases in Python.",4
92052,Great way to combine SQL and Python!,5
92053,Perfect course to start up with databases.,5
92054,"Very good, but rather brief. It does teach you the basics, but uses Python 2, not 3.",3
92055,"Very basic, rather simple",2
92056,"Best coursera course I've done so far. Thanks for a great course. Would reccomend anyone who has used ORM's ,but is not yet comfortable with relation database theory and using raw SQL to take this course. Also great for people who enjoy python in general.",5
92057,Great Fantastic,5
92058,"Thank you so much for your sharing, Dr. Chuck!",5
92059,"This course only touches on python + relational databases. Specifically, investigates SQLITE and the sqlite3 python library. The work is very minuscule (assignments were to simply modify pre-written python scripts). Nevertheless, good introduction to DB coding in python.",4
92060,really good for understanding,5
92061,"Perfect course, as usual.",5
92062,Excellent course material from an excellent Instructor!,5
92063,This course is great for beginners and Dr Chucky is very good teacher.,5

92074,Not enough material covered to make it worth the cost.,2
92075,"This course on Python has taught me the aspect of "" DATA MINING "" using Python. One of the best courses on Python and indeed very tought and challenging to do it.It also taught me how the "" Google Web Crawling "" works. Thank you Dr. Charles and Coursera for this beautiful course.",5
92076,Good topic and will give Python developers a good start with database access and usage through the most basic cursor methods. I would like a course like this to include setting up something like PyODBC. Maybe a 2nd more advanced course can be done for more extensive database activity.,5
92077,I learned much more about what programming is used for and how it works. This last part of the course built on the 'building blocks' of the earlier modules and thought it went a bit fast in the final stages it left me feeling a real sense of achievement.The materials are really well organised and engaging. When I look back I see that I've come a long way.,5
92078,A great course! Thanks to Dr. Chuck for presenting such a complex subject so well.,5
92079,Perfect!,5
92080,Excellent primer for using python with databases.,5
92081,"A great continuation of the former courses, continues in the same line that the other and you really keep growing in your python knowledge.",5
92082,The exercises need more work done if the students are expected to actually learn this stuff.,3
92083,"As with the third course in the specialization, the lectures give just enough to allow students to independently advance their learning outside the course. To be honest, I think the instructor covers too much ground in too short a time for most students to gain a lot of understanding. Furthermore, the assignments are quite straightforward requiring minimal adaptation of the supplied code.The module on Object Orientated Programming is, frankly, a waste to time and a distraction. There are no practical exercises and the material is run through at a pace that makes it unlikely that anyone without prior knowledge would make any sense of it. What is more, there is no reference to, or use of, OOP at any other point in the course or specialization. The time would have been better spent in expanding the modules on the core topics of using databases with Python.On the positive side, the external tools on Dr Chuck's own website seem to work as expected and integrate smoothly with Coursera. The forums also remain supportive, although, as with most courses, far less active than on the old platform.I still rate this as a 4 star (albeit a 4-) as Dr Chuck is such an engaging instructor and there is still a good progression through the specialization. I would be more cautious if taking this as a standalone course.",4
92084,Great course! I wish we were supposed to do more coding in the weekly exercises.,4
92085,Great explanation of the fundamentals of databases.,5
92086,"Great course and additional materials. The last week seemed a bit too far away from the previous one, though. Still it was manageable and understandable, Thanks.",4
92087,"If you want to learn Python, this series should be your first step!",5
92088,"One of the best professor, I have learned so many things from the 4 classes.",5
92089,Best Python Intro!,5
92090,Great course. It allowed me to work with databases.,5
92091,A great course because of the teaching style of Instructor Dr.Chuck.,5
92092,I don't want to this course to be over! One of the best courses EVER!!!!,5
92093,Best course in the entire specialization so far.,5
92094,"The best way to meet programming as a discipline for the first time! Сharismatic teacher, useful assignments, well-thought-out course. Thank you Charles Severance and Coursera team!",5
92095,A great beginning to play around databases using Python.,5
92096,Thank you doctor Chuck!,4
92097,"Excellent structure. A course I really enjoyed and learnedPerhaps should add optional assignments for more experienced users, in order to intrigue them. Additionally, upon completion, perhaps the e-mail should contain a link to the ""correct"" files of alla assignments, in order to assess our progress and methods",5
92098,Excellent course and instructor.,5
92099,The best ever course!,5
92100,Professor Chuck is awesome! This course is highly recommended!,5
92101,"This course does an excellent job of blending a basic introduction to relational databases and SQLite with some important tools in Python. Folks comfortable with SQL can probably skip most of the lecture in weeks 2 and 3, as the content is focused on learning SQL and using the SQLite browser as opposed to using Python with these tools. This was a great way to bring together the fundamentals from the first three courses in this specialization.",5
92102,"Verbose, wandering. Instructor takes too long to do too little. No value add over a textbook.",1
92103,Would love to have more challenging assignments,4
92104,"The final course in the amazing Python for Everybody Specialization by UMich and Dr. Charles Severance. Really glad I took part in these series, which improved my skills in Python programming. Real hands-on approach to show the basic and essential concepts about how to interface with databases using as a tool the embedded sqlite, how to correctly define normalized tables, and how to implement important design patterns.",5
92105,"The course is easy, but informative.",4
92106,There was not as much coding as prior courses but students can learn the knowledge of database.,4
92107,Thank you!,5
92108,"No teaching. Just a guy talking. Do the problem sets for practice. If you need help, pause the videos and try the code out yourself.Seriously though, a programming course where the teacher is not actively type out the code but just scribbling around it. He doesn't work through code but talks around the concepts.",1
92109,Very nice course. The professor is awesome!,5
92110,"Good initial overview to the topic. Most code is actually provided to the student, preventing deeper learning via trial & error. However, it is a tradeoff of making the course accessible to a large number of students versus being too challenging and preventing newcomers from enjoying the subject. Dr. Severance is excellent -- entertaining and clearly very knowledgable. For any novice programmers looking to understand how Python interacts with databases, this is the best place to start.",4
92111,Awesome course - looking forward to the Capstone,5
92112,Another great course. Thank you for sharing your knowledge with me.,5
92113,thanks for the course! It was very useful for me.,5
92114,"Nice, it's been so much easier to learn data thing.",5
92115,"Amazing class, I cannot have enough of this professor, very very good",5
92116,Great class,5
92117,very impressive.,5
92118,Amazing course. I have done all 4 of the Python courses offered by the University of Michigan and can't rate them highly enough.,5
92119,"I felt like this course of the specialization wasn't as organized. First of all the object oriented class had no practical assignment, and while others did, they weren't contributing for the learning. I passed all the assignments but don't think I've mastered material here as much as in the previous courses of the specialization.It seems to me that material could be broken up into two courses, and because it's squeezed in one, the instructors have to provide 99% of the assignment and finishing the rest 1% is not helping in learning. Would be much better to be required to do more work in the assignments (possibly step by step and by splitting the course).",3
92120,"The course is great, but I hope I can get to the final project. I have a little bit experience in python, so I skipped the first two courses of the specialisation project. But I still want to try the 5th one, which is locked to me now~",4
92121,"I faced certain gap in this course and its been difficult to remember the syntax , although concepts i did know , But For a university student of A country where English is not dominant , Understanding the question is quite difficult for people who learn so many languages in their fields :) . But Still I recommend it",5
92122,Dr. Chuck has a way to explain course materials very clear and straightforward. I would certainly recommend this course to anyone interested in learning python.,5
92123,It is good short course but could be better if it is more detailed and l could work on more examples but the last week was awesome.,4
92124,"It is great course because it doesn't only teach you Python, it leads you to write real application using Python.",5
92125,Great Course,5
92126,"Rather interesting, but I felt the questions and programs were too easy.",4
92127,All of these courses in this specialization are very good and useful!,5
92128,"Perfect teacher, teaching and very useful information. Highly recommended",5
92129,The course videos and lecture materials were good. But the homework assignments were easy.,4
92130,It is a good introductory course for SQL.,5
92131,"As with the previous courses in this series, this class is excellent. It builds on what what was discussed in the preceding courses and combines it all to show students how it all comes together to create practical applications. Not only that, but you will learn about how databases work as well as best practices for building databases. Charles Severance has a way of making seemingly complex concepts very simple to understand. One of my favorite instructors thus far.",5
92132,"Excellent course , thank you very much for sharing the knowledge",5
92133,"Helpful, interesting, useful course :) thank you for help to learn Python !",5
92134,Great,5
92135,Great. Simply great. I highly recommend the four part course series,5
92136,Already the best!,5
92137,"This course gives very basic information about using python to retrieve web data in json and html format. It's helpful and makes the learners feel good. This course is that it prepares almost ready codes for every test and homework. This could be a good reference for people who want know how to do sth, but have no much time digging into the complex way. However, it may also reduce the strength of learning.",4
92138,"Exercises in the course were very poor, simple and did not require coding, just changing one or two lines. But topic was interisting",3
92139,Great to learn how easy the SQL and Python integrate. Very straightforward examples and tests. Well explained and exactly what was needed.,4
92140,Database beginner can learn a lot from it.,5
92141,Take this course. Some assignments more difficult than others. Pace is good for folks newer to python but goes faster with some knowledge of programming,5
92142,"Did not know how datbases work. Did not know SQL. Prof. Severance, has explained and deconstructed this so well in the lectures with examples that now it does not seem so intimidating. A great course indeed !",5
92143,I can take courses but can't have an access to the project for free ?,5
92144,"Such a great class for those beginning to user Python in a database environment. Lots of good, solid information.",5
92145,"The course is great in that I felt I gained alot of insight into how data mining is done but I don't feel I gained much skill in using databases with python. The assignments are making minuscule modifications to existing code. I think it would have been a better exercise to either write a new program for each assignment or have the student build out a single program throughout the course. But, as always, Dr. Chuck is the best.",4
92146,Very good one...but visualization could have been done with matplotlib or other plotting libraries.,5
92147,"I really appreciate the course. Professor Charles explained every line of the code written by him and also gave real time examples and problems for assignments, which is my favorite part. I'd also be elated if the course fee had been a bit lesser than the mentioned as I cannot afford that amount for a single course. Nevertheless, overall it's a good course to enroll.",5
92148,Nice for beginners and nice explained lesson.,5
92149,Fantastic course. Thank you.,5
92150,Excellent course. Thank you for sharing this as a MOOC!,5
92151,Not much exercises.,4
92152,"Really nice course, teach me how to do really cool things using Python,not just the Python language.However, the homework is a bit easy .",5
92153,Love the course but due to time-pressure have to stop now. Might pick it up later.,5
92154,loved this course.,5
92155,"Very nice and informative course. A lot of practical examples and inspiration for further use. I missed a bigger final assignment, but then again I assume that is what the capstone project is for. Overall a very good course!",5
92156,Good course. I learned a lot of things!!,5
92157,I finished this course and I would like to learn more specific!!,5
92158,Really good staff!I've really used this knowledge yet!,5
92159,"It's a good one, but could be better having more applications.",4
92160,"This is my first course on Coursera and i'm very satisfied, I liked the lecturer, assignments and tests. I want to thank you for this course",5
92161,"Very nice and very good intstructor. Clear examples. Clear presentation. However, some assignments are a bit too easy, even for beginners. Learnt a lot!",4
92162,Great!!!,5
92163,Pretty good!,5
92164,not as fun and challenging as other 3 preceding Python courses but still a great one!,4
92165,I've really enjoyed the whole series.,5
92166,It is a very useful course and the instructor is very good,5
92167,Wonderful course.,5
92168,"This course was really nice one. I am expecting more courses on ""Using Databases with Python and data analytics""",5
92169,Simply to the point. No more no less.,5
92170,"Amazing course, really!I was so excited to learn about SQLite and about how easy it could be used anywhereThanks to you, dr.Chuck, you have great job done with this course!",5
92171,"Very applicable to real world development, but well thought out and executed for all levels to learn.",5
92172,"The class was fast paces, documentation and videos easy to digest and quizzes and projects elaborated enough at the same time short to complete.",5
92173,great course,5
92174,A great introduction to database design and SQL with Python in hand.,5
92175,"+ I appreciated the visual nature of the course+ I appreciated the background info on databases+ I liked learning SQL and using the SQLite browser.- update to python3, I'm running python3 and found it difficult to correct the issues with urllibs in the ifnal assignmet.",4
92176,"I liked this course, but I think the assignments could have been slightly more challenging.",4
92177,I like the introduction to the databases theoric and the geolocalization introduction. I miss a deeper content about geocoding practices.,5
92178,The instructor is really clear and fun. Workload is reasonable.,5
92179,"Well worth the time to take this course. It is a basic course, but I learned allot.",5
92180,I enjoy taking this course and learning how to interface with the database via Python. I also appreciate Dr. Charles Severance for archiving and providing the bonus interview videos with legendary computer scientists such as Niklaus Wirth and Andrew S. Tanenbaum. They are worth watching!,5
92181,The course was great for beginners. It is kinda slow but it is really up to the student to apply and reapply what they learn over and over again.,5
92182,I loved the teaching. The video are great and the examples too... But I almost did not program! The course is 'too easy' and I feel I did not practice enough!,3
92183,The Best Course,5
92184,Dr. Chuck at his best :),5
92185,Excellent course. Would highly recommend for students looking to further their knowledge in python and introduction to SQL.,5
92186,Awesome course. I learned a lot during these 5 weeks.,5
92187,"I happily give 5 stars for this course. In a few words, I appreciated Dr. Chuck's style of teaching being emphatic when needed. The pace of the lessons was good and I could finish the course in a reasonable time, managing to acknowledge all the concepts. Thanks for the teaching, Coursera and UMich team!",5
92188,A great exposure to basic databases and what you can do with them!,5
92189,Very interesting and informative. Thanks,5
92190,"plz last lecture in this course, you can better understanding to me.",3
92191,"This is really fantastic, thanks Dr. Chuck",5
92192,A good way to start with databases.,5
92193,I wish the slides will be shown a little longer before switching back to the instructor. Great course!,5
92194,Very useful course for anyone wanting to take their python to the next level.,5
92195,"I missed more details and exercises on the last part of the course. For example, that geoload/geodump/where-data could be given as exercises during the course and joined at the end to make that map solution.",3
92196,"These courses, taught by the well spoken Professor Severance, is fantastic for beginners in the Python language. I feel like I've learned more from these than any book I just picked up and started reading. Charles Severance not only explains how to work with Python but the full spectrum of W's(who, what, when, why).I'd recommend signing up for this if you are interested in Python. In fact, I've touted its usefulness to quite a few people in conversation.",5
92197,"Wonderful information! Although my experience is little, I feel accomplished after these modules.",5
92198,"This course was awesome, as were the rest of the courses in this set by Dr. Chuck. He does a really good job of explaining the content so it's understandable. I found that I REALLY like working with database programming, so now I'm off to find more database programming courses to learn more. :-) Thank you so much for this course set, Dr. Chuck! Can't wait to see more from you! :-)",5
92199,A clear explanation of the topic. Very useful background on sql and intro to sqlite.,5
92200,"Really enjoyed this part of the course, I work with databases so it was great to add an element of programming to my background knowledge, I felt a bit cheated with the final week as it was more of an over view rather than a programming assignment but it was interesting to see how every",5
92201,It's great for everyone looking to do data analysis using python.,5
92202,This course teaches solid fundamentals about using Python to interact with datatbases. It also provides great deal of background information on the wider world of software development and basic database administration.,5
92203,"Very great videos, easy assignments.",5
92204,Excellent course. Content and explanations are well thought out and relevant. A++++,5
92205,"Dr. Chuck once again breaks down very complex subject matter into easily digestible chunks for us newbies. My only issue with this course is that the hardest parts of the assignments were already done and all that was required from us was some slight tweaking in existing code. That may or may not be intended and the real challenge lies with the Capstone Project.Nonetheless, if you are curious about how databases work, there's lots to learn here. I know I did!",4
92206,"Very neat course. I really recommend it for these who start with Python,or just want to remind themselves such topics.",4
92207,Useful skills were presented in this course. Thankyou,5
92208,"Very good and easily accessible. Mostly about databases and how to use them through Python, less on Python itself. The assignments were too easy though. Usually one had to add one to few lines of code.",5
92209,"Really nice final course of this specialization, new learnings and insights. Now of to do my very own data analysis project with Python!",5
92210,Very interesting course.,5
92211,An excellent introductory course which got me up-and-running in no time.,5
92212,The best!,5
92213,great course,5
92214,Absolutely fantastic. Dr. Chuck's teaching style is completely in-sync with my learning style. The content is clearly presented and the effort in teaching shows. Thank you Dr. Chuck for taking the time to present this material and for creating the tools for all of us to use.,5
92215,Very good introduction to databases and the use of this with python. uses python 2 version. Simple explanation for beginners. Recommended.,4
92216,Good Course,5
92217,"This is an extremely high level introduction to SQL and how to use DBs in data processing programs.If you have no experience you will get a feeling and some basic idioms to apply, so it is a good start.If, like me, you already have a good SQL knowledge but little Python knowledge you can quickly learn how to access DBs and just go through the videos to have an easy overview of interesting applications.As in previous courses I appreciated Dr. Chuck relaxed exposition and some of his interviews with people I just had their names on my books, like Tannembaum.",4
92218,"Outstanding class! All of the ""Python for Everybody"" classes are great! The material is covered exceptionally well, and is real-world relevant!",5
92219,I really enjoyed this course. I learnt so much and I'm confident that I can go on from here to writing more complex python programs.Thank you Dr. Chuck.,5
92220,Hand on examples to really enjoy your path to learn how to program with Python \o/,5
92221,"The Professor is amazing, with a great sense of humor. But, I felt that the last three assigments were rather easy, given the fact that the code was almost all produced by the Professor.",4
92222,Allowed me to increase my Python knowledge.Very interisting course.,5
92223,"Interesting content, well structure lessons but too easy assesments.",3
92224,Thanks for this amazing series Chuck!,5
92225,Great course for those not familiar with databases and SQL. Well paced and the program templates are very good in making sure that the students understand what it is they're trying to do without letting the writing of the same code that was written for previous courses and assignments get in the way of the new material. Dr. Severance is an incredible instructor.,5
92226,Great curse. But assingments were to easy,4
92227,"Coming from some programming background, I have learned the most in this course of the whole series. Thanks Dr. Chuck!",5
92228,Awesome. We need more classes like this one :),5
92229,It was great,5
92230,I'd expected it to be more difficult.,4
92231,Really good intro and broader view of the interactions with other technologies.,5
92232,Nice< very informative and useful course!,5
92233,Very useful! Dr. Chuck's the best professor.,5
92234,"Excellent refresher for me; and a good basic level course for those new to programming and want to understand the basic concepts of writing code, connecting and parsing data in a much easier way.",5
92235,"Very short lectures and easy assignments, but a good overview and starting point for further studies.",3
92236,"Great course, So far one of the best I have seen in this planet.There is always room to improve the best to take it a notch up..... This is what I would do to make it better.1.Supply ton of more information for each course so students who are interested might explore but the new and additional information. This dont have to interfere with the course. Just for additional informations so the students can get some more info if they wanted.2.I like the fact that there is some industry talk someone who are in the Industry or who was in the industry who come and give a small tech talk ....please provide more motivational materials like this. Not all the time I want to see Mr. Chuck alone.3.Please come to Toronto.4.The reason I am able to finish this course because the assignments was easy .....IF it was hard forget it i would have quit long before...... this happens in lots of other coursers I take...Sorry its just me.",5
92237,What a marvellous contents!,5
92238,Thank you Dr. Chuck!,5
92239,Charles Severance is an excellent teacher. I'm glad he taught me the beginnings of Python!,5
92240,Course is very good itself but assignments is very easy.,4
92241,"It was a great journey, I learnt a lot in this course and I will continue to learn all of it, many many thanks to Dr. Chuck and the staff, It's a great course, I enjoyed a lot with python and Dr. Chuck.",5
92242,"Professor Chuck is my new hero. Ok, some would say that the course is very easy. In truth, it was for me, but I'm a professional programmer who fell in love with Python a few years ago and I'm always looking for excuses to just have fun with it. And although for someone with my experience it is was not a difficult course, I still learned some things from it, and the instructor is a great, down to earth lecturer who is clearly very passionate about teaching and Python, and well, traveling the world. ;) So even if you are an experienced programmer, then unless you are sure that you absolutely can't learn anything more about using Python to access SQL databases and you don't want to have a lot of fun, then take this course!",5
92243,"This course presents you python-database accessing concepts via sqlite, if you are trying to learn accessing Oracle or anything other enterprise database product consider this as alphabets",5
92244,"Great Course, Great Teacher!",5
92245,"This course shows off how easy and quickly one can obtain, store, and manipulate data in a database using Python.. Excellent course with rapid learning of material that can be immediately used in the real world.",5
92246,"Great teacher, fun course!Thanks!",5
92247,Very interesting.,5
92248,lectures are good. hw assignments are just a tad too easy. i believe diligent students could handle slight;y more difficult assignments,4
92249,Great course.I enjoyed it very much.,5
92250,"Great Professor, great course! He makes programming fun.",5
92251,Very straightforward! I liked it.,5
92252,It's a good course. But the homework is kind of easy. I hope to get more practices.,5
92253,"Nice introduction with easy exercises, very good starting point from where students can explore and do more on their own.",5
92254,Thanks again! Great course.,5
92255,"Excellent instructor! Only the best technologies - on bleeding-edge: python, d3, web apis",5
92256,"It's still a good series of courses, and now they are breaking down the lectures into shorter chunks. That makes it easier to download and easier to manage my study time.The slides and screenviews are still hard to see. Tiny purple text on a black background just *does*not*work*.Up to week 2 I'm finding the explanations are not deep and detailed enough, and the assignments are too easy and superficial.But I guess that's OK, it's a short course and it gives you a quick overview of a bunch of different technologies. It is very good at that.",5
92257,It's bittersweet reaching the last course in this specialization. I'm going to miss Dr Chuck.,5
92258,"Great course and excellent introduction to the SQL databases. The only minor point is the last assignment - I was really looking forward to be challenged in some D3.js data visualisation, but the task had nothing to do with programming. On the bright side - I've got some boiler plate code to play with in my free time.",5
92259,"Well organized, well presented and has adequate information to introduce you to the capabilities of the sqlite.",5
92260,This is definitively one of my favorite course taken on Coursera.Thanks Dr. Chuck!,5
92261,"Very useful, easy to follow and you must work to finish it.",5
92262,Pretty easy for beginners to catch up with!,4
92263,"Great course for beginners! Maybe sometimes it's too easy, but it is for me, who familiar with programming, but for those, who want to try their skills it is BEST CHOICE!",5
92264,Smooth，,5
92265,"Excellent, as all the other courses!",5
92266,"As having completed all coursers of introduction to python environment, I can fully recommend this series of courses to anyone interested in learning how to program. Is it not an impossible task, just a little time and commitment. Thanks to Dr. Chuck, he is the best teacher and he really knows how to lay these subjects in an easy and understandable way. I hope in the future there will be more courses like these to become a better programmer and student and to learn new and interesting things.",5
92267,This course provides very useful information on how Python can be used to access the DB and how the data can be manipulated from the plain text/xml to DB and then to the real word applications such as Google Maps.Very useful and learnt a lot. The presentation was very detailed and to the point.Thank you for the effort.,5
92268,"Course is easy, but that's fine. Dr. Chuck explains and shows everything in an easy to understand way, and I know that I came away from this course with a ton of new ideas of what I can do.",5
92269,"As always great level of teaching by Dr. Chuck, but milestone tasks was not so challenging as within previous course. Thanks!",4
92270,great course,5
92271,great course,5
92272,"All homework were to modify from an existing code, and all lessons were skimming on indexes. I learned less than other courses from this series.",3
92273,That is the best python courses I've take.,5
92274,Thank You!!!,5
92275,Dr. Chuck is a genius who can teach anything with so much ease in just 5-10 minutes and i have been taking his courses regularly. But this one i found it just a bit difficult and sometimes lost specially in Many-to-Many Relationship. That was the hardest i think. But still I am now comfortable in using SQL Lite with Python which is a big step forward for me :),5
92276,I do not find this course is useful to learn seems it only gives a guideline to the python database.,3
92277,I was wondering if it is necessary to learn some Javascript to visualize my data?,5
92278,Excelent course for beginners,5
92279,"This is the fourth class I've taken with Professor Severance, and they've all been really useful and enjoyable to me, thanks!",5
92280,Nice.. I really liked the course. I would also like to learn advanced stuffs in python,5
92281,This course is easy to understand how python works.,4
92282,"i really like this course, brings together various aspects of using Python in real world situations (career or enthusiast)",5
92283,A bit too easy. I really wish there'd be a more advanced project for us to better understand and implement the database and python,4
92284,Another great course from Dr. Chuck,5
92285,Very good teacher/instructor.,5
92286,Nice course....I like this course because its very easy to implement,5
92287,"Generally an outstanding course, however I was a bit concerned that the video lectures, programming assignments, and quizzes didn't exactly follow the book.",4
92288,This course is great! Just one thing a little regretful---the final assignment really needs to a better design and reflects what is taught in the class.,5
92289,The only reason I can't give this course a 5 star rating is the final assignment is not substantial enough. Otherwise this is the best course series for any beginner or someone trying to refresh their programming knowledge.,4
92290,Great Course!,5
92291,very nice coaching by chuck,4
92292,very good and understandable.,5
92293,Informative,5
92294,An excellent introduction into SQL,5
92295,Dr. Chuck is Great! Quite a useful course.,5
92296,Another excellent course ... Congratulations to the University of Michigan and Dr. Chuck.,5
92297,Thank you for the great class series. I am looking forward to other classes offered by this Instructor.,5
92298,"Great course, great teacher.",5
92299,Thank you for such an excellent course.,5
92300,"The instructor and the contents are great, but the assignments are not challenging.",4
92301,Excellent Python course. Gives overview and introduction on how Python can be used to work on Databases.,5
92302,The Best!,5
92303,"Overall, an excellent course, as all courses from Dr Chuck.The last assignment could have been more demanding to stretch our learning before the Capstone.It is a real pity that one has to pay for all previous courses in order to take the final Capstone :-(Well done!",4
92304,"Excellent course, excellent instructor. Dr. Chuck has a great way of introducing concepts and explaining them thoroughly.",5
92305,this series is an awesome introductory course in python and computer basics,5
92306,Great course. Effective learning with great course material.,5
92307,Very intuitive class.,5
92308,Good combination of theory concept and practical exercises.,5
92309,Wonderful class with a great instructor!,5
92310,ExcellentVery good course for learning how to use the library SQLite in python and how to manipulate data in a database.,5
92311,Great course and dr.Chuck is #1 :),5
92312,"Very good course in Python. Technical, beginner friendly yet rich in content.",5
92313,Another great course in this specialization that shows how python interacts with databases. Professor Chuck does a great job in explaining all the concepts and showing examples. I am already looking forward to the Capstone project.,5
92314,Great!!!,5
92315,Charles Severance is perhaps the greatest instructor of a programming language that I have ever encountered. Not only are the lectures engaging but the assignments are relevant and I have been able to apply what I have learned immediately to my day to day life.,5
92316,"I had a little bit of knowledge about Python coding before taking these courses, but it was very insightful and helpful in my quest to learn more and helped instill the things I did already know.",5
92317,Great as the others!,5
92318,The best section so far. Applications could have been a bit more challenging.Great work Dr Severance.,5
92319,"Same as the 3 previous courses in this specialization, this one is also very informative. And the explanations are very clear.Only one thing I realize after these 4 courses -- exercises are all very simple, or rather, the difficult part of the exercises are already made, and we only need to add very simple part of the code. This way we don't get much practice. As a result, when i wanted to program something myself, i needed to search for references constantly. But probably the final project of the specialization is exactly there to cover the practicing part. Looking forward to it.",5
92320,Look no further! University of Michigan's Charles Severance courses are a MUST if you want to learn Python or basics of programming. Bonus videos really put a perspective on how all of the pieces of the computer/internet puzzle fit together.Highly recommended!,5
92321,"good course, very elementary",5
92322,Very helpful and interesting course!,5
92323,Great course to get an overview of mysql.,5
92324,Awesome classes and Material!,5
92325,The course material was very good but the assignments were boring and unchallenging,3
92326,"Dr Chuck makes the daunting look less daunting. Subjects covered include exploration of API, grounding in data scraping etiquette, basic data modeling economical database normalization, continuation of Google API geocoding, use of Python for scraping and cleaning data. The course assumption is that if you made it this far, you can handle a speedier pace of content delivery. The discussion forums are more valuable too, as one learns what libraries and functions differ between Python 2.7.x and Python 3.x.",5
92327,very good course love the way it is. Thanks,5
92328,This course is not challenging at all.,2
92329,"Very good material and very good teacher!!!, hope to take another course performed by Dr. Chuck.",5
92330,Loved the course! Have now taken all python courses from Dr. Chuck.,5
92331,Charles Severance is the best...,5
92332,"very objective, but a little simple.",4
92333,"Focused too much on SQL rather than Python, so not really that helpful for people who already know SQL (like myself)",3
92334,Great way to learn databases and interaction with Python,5
92335,"Using Databases with Python is, in one word, awesome! Thank you very much for your great Coursera course, Prof",5
92336,Thank you for very good programming lessons :),5
92337,"It's a great course. Prof. Severance is a very good instructor that makes hard things look easy. Though I'm not a noob in Python programming, I've learnt a couple of cool tricks. And one more thing, the bonus videos are awesome!",5
92338,Could use more hands on coding,3
92339,"Hands down , This course will be taught by Dr chuck need I say more, One of the best professor on this coursera platform, who explains concepts in such a way that any one can understand them .",5
92340,Another good course from Dr. Chuck!,5
92341,Thank you!,5
92342,A little bit too easy,4
92343,really good teacher and good class,5
92344,"Course is interesting, but tasks are way too easy.",3
92345,"This course could do with harder assignments. This last one was just ""run my code"" and screenshot stuff. Learned a lot though",4
92346,Great course. A great extension to the original course,4
92347,Very Useful,5
92348,really nice course for starters such as me,5
92349,I think it would be good to include into course following topics:1) NoSQL databases2) ORMs,3
92350,cool but short,5
92351,"The course completes the series and does it well. I work for one of the RDBMS vendors, so I've been around SQL for a long time, and this course does an excellent job at the basics, plus how to use python along with the basics. Highly recommended.",5
92352,"Dr. Chuck is an excellent teacher. This is true particularly because he is so passionate about the subject and skilled in both the craft as well as helping others to learn it.For me, learning databases has been a very fun and liberating study. I needed it. I have been planning my own version of a personal finance application with all of the features and customization that I want in it for some time now. Learning databases was and is an important step in reaching the knowledge level that I think I need to attempt my project with some probability of success and happiness with the end product. I have done some event-driven programming in Python, and have messed around in someone else's GUI in that class, but designing and implementing my own GUI won't be easy. Thanks to Dr. Chuck's class series, however, I feel much more confident that I can go out there and review the different third party GUI libraries and see if any will get the job done for now.Alternatively, the University where Dr. Chuck teaches also has a web design certificate that seems like it might be useful. If GUI programming is too hard I might go with a web version since I have heard that Javascript, particularly jquery and D3 would make my task of graphing and presenting financial data quite doable.",5
92353,The lectures and examples definitely give a great overview of using SQL with python.The assignments really helped to ingrain some of the lectures details .Some more assignments would definitely be helpful to learn more about the the intricacies of using SQL with python.,5
92354,Practical and useful!,5
92355,Fourth class in a row with Dr. Chuck. I know that Dr. Chuck is indefatigable and will be adding to his collection of didactic excellence again in the near future...,5
92356,Great class and great set of classes. Dr. Chuck does an awesome job of clearly conveying concepts that stick with you. I have already used the content I've learned to perform some the associated tasks of my job better and faster.,5
92357,It's just awesome!,5
92358,Awesome! Advanced tools in Python.,5
92359,I think most of code should write enrolled students. How can you learn something just copying lines of code and making minor changes? Or just running already wrote code like in the last section?,3
92360,This course is very useful. Could you please include oops concept as well.,5
92361,Dr. Chuck has a great ability to put in easy way the computation concepts.,5
92362,Great class! Really liked learning how to interact with databases in Python and will be using this foundational knowledge to continue the development of my database design/SQL skills.,5
92363,"Dr Chuck,Databases was a dreaded subject for me. Tried my hands a couple of times and left it alone. Thanks to you and your team (if any), I am pretty confident of designing small scale DBs and play around with it.Again, simplification of explanations holds the key here. Kudos!!!rgds,umesh",5
92364,This was one of the greatest courses I had done. I really recommend it to others!,5
92365,Awesome course and Lecturer Dr.Chuck,5
92366,Very interesting course.,5
92367,"I am satisfied with provided information and can say that assignments was pretty interesting for me. Love maps and coordinate systems, so last assignment was especially interesting.",5
92368,Very useful course!,5
92369,Dr.Chuck is great!,5
92370,Comprehensive overview of how Python can be applied to Data Science.,5
92371,"As usual, Dr. Chuck's courses are awesome!",5
92372,The lectures are clear and the practical assignments are very nice!,5
92373,I love it! It really helps me to grow up in my carrier!,5
92374,Great course. Covers lots of great information on how to use Python to access and use databases.,5
92375,"i think this one is the most ""complicated"" course among python coursesbut your structured course notes and your very-easy-to-understand presentations help me a lot !thanks prof",5
92376,"The lessons were simple, concise and although the assignments are simple, they are unexpectedly satisfying! Dr Chuck must have put a lot of time to come up with the code, draft the materials for this course and make it accessible enough to people without a database background! I especially like the last assignment! Thanks Dr Chuck!",5
92377,Another great class that covers a lot of information that builds nicely on the preceding classes. I would like to see an additional Exercises per topic that more complex. Maybe add an extra credit or bonus one.,4
92378,A thorough and comprehensive course. Highly recommended.,5
92379,Charles Severance is a great professor. He explains clearly every argument making the lessons enjoyable. Thanks so much.,5
92380,I knew python to some extent before this course. Now i have learned so much and even started writing small command line applications and web scrapers on my own. This course is just a great way for me to get started on databases too. This will be help me write really useful command line applications. Thanks to coursera for bringing this wonderful specialization into my life.,5
92381,Comprehensive overview of disease screenings for clinicians as well as public health professionals,4
92382,Very interesting course but work needs to done on the language component which was sometimes very confusing. Some really good Powerpoint presentation work.,4
92383,"Excellent content , but weak language commanding with a strong accent",4
92384,"Overall good quality course, interesting and relevant. The only drawback are the quizzes because sometimes the answer is not clear, even after watching carefully the video and reading material.",4
92385,Great videos; clear communication,5
92386,Great content and delivery!,5
92387,An outstanding course with a great Professor!,5
92388,"ES UN EXCELENTE CURSO, YO ESTUDIO QUIMICA, Y ME SIRIVO MUCHO PORQUE HAY COSAS QUE NO APRENDES TAN FACIL Y ESTE ES UN CURSO GENERAL DONDE PUEDES ABARCAR TODA LA QUIMICA PREVIA QUE YA SE SABE Y SE CONOCE.",5
92389,Muy buen Profesor!,5
92390,"Great course, Thank you!",5
92391,Great teacher and really funny!,5
92392,Very useful course for Russian speaking beginners. Everything explained in a very simple understandable manner.,4
92393,"It's very interesting, understandable and usefull course! I defenitely recomend it for every one who interested in DYI electronics and relevant",5
92394,"good course for beginners, it gives you the basics and hints for further self development in this field",5
92395,"Great course! If you really want to understand how Arduino works - you MUST go through this course! Only one thing - it is in Russian, so I hope course staff will make translation this course in English or they'll make good transcript and subtitles.",5
92396,It would be better if you add switch-language option.,5
92397,"Each specialization has been better than the previous one, and I have learned so much. The sad part for me is that with everything I learn I understand how much more I need to learn. But having said that, this course and the professors are wonderful, and their excitement about photography is conveyed in every class.",5
92398,I have learned a lot from this course!,5
92399,Great course.,5
92400,I learned a lot. Loved the assignments.,5
92401,"Very comprehensive lessons, easy to understand professors & practical tasks that are very useful in applying the knowledge learned. I highly recommend these courses at the Michigan State University specially to the busy people who prefers practice than theories!",5
92402,"useful ""tecnical"" information about implementation",4
92403,"great value, sometimes need some personal consult",5
92404,"This course is a unique oportunity to learn photography, Professors Glendinning and Sullivan share all their knowledge whith us, thanks!",5
92405,"Sometimes we might think we know a lot, but this course adds very well to your photography knowledge in very many areas.Highly recommended.",5
92406,loved it! I am look at buying a DSLR camera soon.....I will be revisiting these lessons,5
92407,Excellent and highly recommended!,5
92408,Now I know how to use basic lighting to make it seem like I have a very complex photography study... Thanks for all the tips and information.,5
92409,Best learning experience so far that has really impacted me on my photography.,5
92410,Thank you Coursera!,5
92411,It is a great class and teaches me a lot.,5
92412,Thanks! Enjoyed this series of courses.,5
92413,Excellent course and fantastic teachers!,5
92414,"It was more about technical stuff and less about art itself. Well, it was pretty good!",4
92415,"Thank you very much for this great specialization! I joined Part 1-4 and learned so much about Photography. I always was interested in Photography. This course helped me to find out, which camera suits me best, conducted me with my first steps in advanced Photography and helped me to increase my photographic skills to the point i am now.Thank you for this great journey you took me in the last months!The Journey has just begun!",5
92416,rock on!,5
92417,"This was a fantastic course that help fill technical gaps in my knowledge of my camera and DIIY studios. There were days that were easy and then there were those that challenged me tremendously. The math was always tough. As a young student deciding on what university I would attend, for my degree in design I had to choose a school that did not have math in my curriculum. Visual arts are my strength. Peter's teaching style of descriptive definitions and instruction, made this class something I look forward to everyday. Students in your real world, Peter, are very lucky to have you as a mentor and a teacher. Those of us, in your virtual world will just have to settle for the lectures that we have on our screen.",5
92418,"It is great experoence! Thank you Prof. Petter , Prof. Mark, Michigan State Universityand Coursera!",5
92419,Excellent course and specialization.,5
92420,Great course with a lot of tips about photography and how to share the work. Great teachers,5
92421,Great experience taking this class and meeting other learners through social networking.,5
92422,Loved it and learned so much!,5
92423,A great course which deals brilliantly with a subject I though would be almost impossible to teach online,5
92424,This was great It made me think of the Social media aspect of the Photography buisness in a different light. I was really blown away the way they helped me with lighting in this course. I can't wait for the capstone project next. Don't miss this course.,5
92425,Thank you for helping me to make better photographies. Family and friends are really excited to see the difference in comparison to the pictures I made before. You are doing a great job.,4
92426,Nothing to say! I learnt many new interesting things!,5
92427,Excellent. Fantastic tutor who delivers the program effectively.,5
92428,It is simply an amazing course. I am truly honor to be a part of such an awesome educational experience.,5
92429,"I have greatly enjoyed this lessons and learned a lot about light, ambient and controlled. Thank you, professors Peter and mark for sharing your knowledge with us and for making all of this concepts easy to understand.",5
92430,I love it!,5
92431,The course is very informative. I had a great time learning.,5
92432,pretty good course,5
92433,Very good course. Needs some Python programming experience,5
92434,Great starter course,5
92435,Good but need more practise problems in order to understand what you are learning,3
92436,I didn't know anything about programming and needed a lot of help with this course. I would have like more help in getting python and its complements install. Thanks.,3
92437,"Good start on Python and some sequence analysis, looking forward to start programming more",4
92438,Great resource with relevant topics,5
92439,it's very useful!,5
92440,Very good course. The course material goes from basic to more advanced content in a very catching way. The quizzes were well structured with very interesting challenges. I definitely improved my python skills a lot in this course,5
92441,I learned a great many Python knowledge from this course. It would be better if the quiz and course material can be connected more closely.,4
92442,"Two teachers in this course are very nice and careful, thank you for you lead me to the new world!",5
92443,"A good introduction to Python, but the course is a rather short & I think more could have been said about genomics-specific functions, modules, etc. and how to use them.",3
92444,It was good and practical.,4
92445,"Started very easy, but became quite hard at the end. Nicely structured and conveyes everything that is needed. However, sometimes I missed why specific tools have been used and not others.",4
92446,The Final Exam was way too difficult compared with the knowledge provided by the lessons.,1
92447,Thanks for giving an overview of Python. It was really Helpful,5
92448,"Thanks for the interesting course made by two brilliant teacher. This is my first time to learn something about computer science on coursera and I really enjoyed this kind of experience. As a beginner of Bioinformatics, this help me a lot. In the futrue I will continue focusing new courses on coursera provided by Johns Hopkins University!",5
92449,"This class was really difficult. The course material did not cover what we needed for the weekly quizzes (particularly in Week 3 & 4) and the final exam was immensely difficult. Additionally, the written instructions for the final exam did not even cover some of the questions that needed to be answered i.e. repeats or questions about particular reading frames when analyzing the ORFs. I had to do a lot of self teaching using random resources and I simply didn't have the bandwidth to dig around as much as was needed in order to do well in the class.",2
92450,Really useful and appropriate for beginners. Thank you so much,5
92451,Although courseware video is well doneAssigment are poorly designed and imbalancedFar too easy on end of each weekLast week final assignment overly difficult and poorly guidedThe sense of progress is very small after completing the courseBiology meets programming from UCSD is better designed on pedagogy and code challenges level.Can't recommend not worth investing time or 50 bucks,2
92452,Very poorly organised material and illustration,1
92453,"Really fun and well explained but very basic. It's just an introduction to Python with a brief presentation of the Biopython module. I guess the next course, Algorithms for Dna Sequencing, is meant to give more grasp on Python for Biology.",5
92454,Great introduction to python for biologists. The final exam is a good challenge for beginners.,5
92455,Poor lectures by one of the instructors makes it hard to listen.,1
92456,"A great medium to learn python via, I'm not a biologist, but that is no barrier, and the backdrop is a great way to learn to play about with Python.",5
92457,This course was in line with my expectations. Sometimes exercises were a bit out of context. I would have probably dedicated more time to Biopython.,4
92458,"The best introductory python tutorial I've come across.......concise, very well organized.......I wish this team come up with a series of courses gradually introducing more advanced topics in this area.....",5
92459,"I think someone who has never coded before can approach this course. However, further reading of the resources presented will augment what has been taught and to better handle the quizzes.",3
92460,"For a person with absolutely not knowledge of programing its a very nice course to take. Its could be more widely explote the Biopython part, but reading the Biopython cookbook and the baisis presented here its just perfect",4
92461,"Good for what it is, but I was hoping for something more advanced (on the algorithm/programming side).",4
92462,"Really good introduction to Python, Genomics in the two together. This was the first Python course - of many - I've since done and then gone on to use Python professionally and for my own 'Hacker/Maker' projects.A few typos / mis-alignments between the slides and the explanations - but nothing serious. The presenters know the material and present it well.A couple of good TAs (full disclosure - I am / have been one of the less good ones!)",5
92463,"I enjoyed the lectures, but I felt they didnt go into enough details on analysis of sequence data. The final project was considerably harder than the material taught in the class and problems with the course (e.g. the final exam file not being available) had obviously not been fixed since the last version of the course. A fell I now have a good basic understanding of python but not enough to do any real analysis. Fantastic course mentor/TA.",3
92464,Great introduction to genomic data science using Python. The questions were challenging enough to make you work and wasn't too difficult that you get blocked.,5
92465,"In just the first 2 weeks I found several quiz questions that are not correct. Example code in quizzes is not complete. Spacing and indentation are incorrect in quiz samples(I realize this is probably to prevent copy paste testing of code, but you cannot answer is this code correct if you don't know where they wanted indentation to line up). Lecture presentation is not very engaging, almost seems like the female instructor was forced to stand in front of a camera and read note cards. Withdrew early.",1
92466,"Errors and glitches in the first two quizes that aren't fixed ('Don't worry, be happy, it's just a formating error, ignore the literal text displayed and just use your imagination to interpret what we thought we meant to say') have left me too unimpressed to spend more time wondering if I need to debug my code or debug their quizes.There are many other resources for learning python out there, and some of them take pedagogy seriously. Not, it seems, this one.",1
92467,Excellent beginners course for those wanting to write personalised scripts in Python to analyse genomic data.,5
92468,Very good--perhaps a little slow for those who have already learned a half-dozen languages.,4
92469,final project almost impossible based on lectures,2
92470,Can't easily understand one of the instructors. Dislike how it chops and changes instructors in the same course.,3
92471,The lectures were really good. I am a microbiologist and have very little background of computer programming. A more detailed course would have he,4
92472,Clear but some topic are not well explained and to pass the final quiz is necessary further detailed study.Very useful the help of the Mentor,4
92473,good starting point to learn python to analysis Genomics data.,5
92474,good course for python but you definitely need to have some background in programming to be able to pass. recommend python course by UMichigan here at Coursera.,4
92475,"Not enough material provided to successfully complete final exam. More detailed explanation needed for newbies in Python and especially for newbies in programming, as it is , I am assuming, target group.",2
92476,very good class,5
92477,Good insight into serious games. Learnt a lot of examples for serious games and the importance of the whole concept. Also how it can be combined with gamification (towards the end).Met a lot of people with some really great ideas for serious games.Good lectures and interesting reading articles. Enjoyed the course.Thank you =),5
92478,Pretty interesting. Made me think,4
92479,"Excellent MOOC. Gives the fundamentals to understand what a serious game is, how it relates to games and how it can become persuasive. You learn key principles needed before you want to start creating. Interesting week assignment.",5
92480,Great course on the foundations of serious games,5
92481,One of the best courses I have done until now in coursera. It is well organized and presented and provide a lot of real examples of serious games to have a clear idea about this topic. Totally recommendable!,5
92482,An interesting course to learn about serious gaming overview. It deliverded with examples and good reference in youtube and websites to view examples of such serious games.,5
92483,Thank You!,5
92484,"Thank you, lecturers/professors! This course has broadened my viewpoint on gaming and its usage in modern world.",5
92485,"Great speakers, great case studies. The rythme of the course is perfect too (duration of the videos, questions, polls, assignments, quizz).. I have nothing to say except maybe it could be interestng to have the feedback of the teachers themselve on our work.",5
92486,"Poor. Fun American English intermissions, that's about it.",2
92487,Some interesting content if you are interested in Serious Games.,4
92488,"Good quality of videos and teaching materials, but I expected more content about gamification.",3
92489,Very educational and i think i is a must for all educators,5
92490,Too little information.,2
92491,"Excellent course. Students have the opportunity to learn about the main features of serious games (definition, how they work, kinds of serious games and other topics). Videos are engaging because learners are encouraged to participate not only by answering questions about content, but also to answer short surveys or to play a game. Also, students are invited to try a lot of games in order to get familiar with serious games. The suggested readings are very interesting (I read most of them). Teachers are nice and enthusiastic. Finally, I liked the course because I had enough time to review concepts and also to play the games. I mean, I learned a lot without feeling overwhelmed.",5
92492,This is a fast pace course and I hope the instructors could explain a little bit more on some difficult concepts rather than just giving short descriptions.,4
92493,This was my first MOOC. I am still in the middle of the course but it is very interesting. The content is very clear and well structured.,5
92494,"This couse about serious games explains very well the principles to make them attaractive and efficient. Furthermore, it gives good information about how to measure their impact and what could be their evolution in the future.",5
92495,Very nicely explained. My old MBA concepts are erased and new wisdom attained. Thank you very much...,5
92496,The contents are very intersting but it's too easy to achieve the certification.,4
92497,great course and fantastic professor.,5
92498,It is Genial +,5
92499,My expectation was met. The course is excellent with real life scenarios and delivered by a very seasoned Professor,5
92500,Great class. Informative. I actually feel like I was challenged in this and retained information.,5
92501,"Very well scripted course suitable for working executives. The assignments are designed in a way, which ensures that only studious and diligent students only can get through.The capstone project demands thorough understanding of the course and its contents.",4
92502,"I liked so much this course, you learn all the bases of strategy and the cases they show are great.",5
92503,Great intro and very clear content.,5
92504,Amazing lectures in a valuable way of sharing knowledge. The business cases brought as examples were very well selected and made the course even more interesting.,5
92505,The Course is a great imprimer for Strategy in Business. It has a lot of references and a clear explaination of the main concepts!,5
92506,I am new to strategy and this course helped me a lot to understand strategy.,5
92507,The course is quiet beneficial considering the current business challenges and change in business strategies to position it perfectly and suit the market trends,5
92508,A good guidance through the history of strategic management where we can learn from the mistakes happened.,5
92509,Amazing how much I learned!,5
92510,"This course is so complete, i am very excited to keep going!",5
92511,"Loved everything about this course and Coursera! The course is clear, concise and the professor kept it interesting all through. The user experience online and on the mobile app is a delight. I could learn and complete the course with minimal changes to my regular schedule and a full time job.",5

92551,"in this course you must take in mind that the past is as important as the future. You will be thoroughly taught the history of strategy, and warned not to repeat it. The golden rule that you'll gain: the world is too complex for a strategy to be put in a manual.",5

92563,Excellent! But need more examples and situations for the respective concepts. The level of difficulty shall be increased so that students will grasp more of the content!Thanks,4
92564,Good introduction into the different concepts,5
92565,The best course Ive ever taken. Mr. Austin has the ability to transmit the most advanced strategy concepts in a few videos rounding up the global situation.,5
92566,"A great course all round! The concepts are simple and well presented for those who haven't studied strategy before, but lots of room to learn through the discussion in the videos and additional reading for those of us who have seen this subject before.The test format I though was a bit over-simplified. I would have preferred to see slightly longer, more demanding tests, perhaps with a different question format. In particular, I found the questionnaire for the capstone project much too simplified - giving all or nothing points means we can't differentiate between people who only just achieved the point (or achieved it partially) and others who achieved it well. Needs an intermediate option.",4
92567,its a new subject. so it has been nice ayway,5
92568,"Fantastic start to the full course. Mostly basic business school material, but gre",5
92569,"Content presented clear, direct and modern. Contemporaneous references and examples help to support and assimilate the content.",5

92572,Great course for people new to business strategy.,4
92573,"I have enjoyed the course work which was straight to the point and has provided the much needed knowledge on various aspects of strategy. May be this course can be titled as ""Strategy-as-a-journey"" too...",5
92574,Very good primer on strategy.,5
92575,There were lots of good case examples that illustrates various strategy approaches. The simplified approach is good for people who does not have business foundation. He is also good presenter and has good lecturing skills.,5
92576,"This course is amazing! It has demystified the concepts of strategy very thoroughly yet succinctly.The instructor is very engaging, articulate and captivating! This course offers a very high level view and understanding of strategy and how businesses come up with them.",5
92577,Good. Clear and sufficient.,5
92578,Superb first week,5
92579,Very Insightful. Thanks.,5
92580,"This is a really weak, and not very smart course compared to the other two in this specialisation (strategy formulation & strategy implementation)",1
92581,Enjoyed the course!,4
92582,Very Good and helpful,4
92583,"A bit light in terms of content, this probably could have been condensed down into 2 lessons.",2
92584,Very crisp but informative as well.,4
92585,"Very interesting course. Seems they only mention previous strategy ideas as historical note and attempt to have students not focus on strategical diagrams (PESTLE, Five-Forces, SWAT, etc) but think of what's going on in modern strategy and business. Thus, have you consider new ideas that are coming out in regards to business strategy.",5
92586,"Thorough introduction in the world of strategic management for each and every one who is not familiar with this field of expertise. However, the modules could provide, through simple graphics and/or easy diagrams, a better understanding of the new principles and ideas that one encounters here. Moreover, there is room for improvement as far as bibliography and in general additional reading are concerned. All in all, the particular course offers a very decent view of this very interesting world of strategy but there are many ways that it could provide an even better experience and knowledge.",3
92587,A lot of very interesting information with great real life examples. Very interesting how approach to strategy is changing so rapidly with new forms of business and technology changes. Exciting to observe and be a part of it.,5
92588,very good course,5
92589,This course was easy to follow without any prior knowledge to strategy and then builds up the knowledge for the project at the end of the course.,5
92590,The course was well put together and worthy of a 5-star. The only issue I had was that they blew through the slides to re-focus on the speaker who was elaborating on the slides. This is very inefficient and very annoying. I often had to stop the video to absorb the written words or take notes when they could have easily continued to play audio for 3-4 seconds longer before going back to the close up of the instructors face--which honestly isn't necessary at all for this course.,5
92591,"Great start. Many promises. But week 3 and 4 go in a wrong direction. Instead of speaking about Strategy - author goes into unrelated fields. Trash bins as a reference of a new strategical approach - misses a point that it is not a mass product. What strategical decisions did it involve that were not related to marketing? Almost none. Strategy is much, much wider term. Regarding new tendencies... Globalization has happened yesterday... Today it's time to open new horizons in relation to application of IT solutions to management problems. After AlphaGo proved that a computer program is more skillful in a complex game of GO than one of the top human players - it will not take much to the next step - strategical decision making on a corporate level. What companies need to do today? Infrastructure - probably. New organizational structure? - Definitely.",2
92592,Very interesting course,4
92593,Excellent Course and great professor I highly recommend it for those who want to learn about Strategic Management.,5

92596,this course make me got more information abut strategy on bussiness,5

92619,"It is a must taken course to understand ""Strategic Management"" from different business schools in critical thinking approach.",5
92620,A great course. Must have for management lovers and entrepreneurs.,4
92621,"The case studies are interesting. The course content is interesting, and the ""history"" of strategy is a very good point of view to start. The capstone project is a real project, that requires 3-4 hours if done properly.",5
92622,I would have liked the level to be a bit higher as well as having my final submission reviewed by a course professional rather than strictly peer-to-peer review.I really liked the to-the-point yet well paced video material. Thumbs up!,4
92623,This class was well done. The material was clearly explained. The quizzes and final project were relevant and served to bring all the material together into a c,5
92624,"So far, the best of the courses I've gone through on Coursera. Prof. Austin has made the difficult concepts of Strategic Management look so simple and easy to understand that even candidates with no prior management experience get really well versed with management techniques at the end of this course.I'd strongly recommend all management students to take up this course.",5
92625,Really its very great to learn in coursera platform. This course is been very useful for me to understand all time business strategies from 1970's til now.,4
92626,Excellent! Very well done. Modern teaching platform. Thanks for such a great job.,5
92627,"This was a really well created project that not only taught us about strategic management, but also gave us counter side to every theory mentioned, the counter-arguments against all the different schools of thought when it comes to management, something which most textbooks and even classes generally skip, which is why this was a very informative course for me. Thank you for creating such a nice course!",5
92628,so far a great course. Thanks,5
92629,The right kick for a good start,4
92630,Very Helpful with Application based learning,5
92631,Thanks !,5
92632,C,4
92633,The course is wonderful. It is design actually for busy people. The course is concise but the expected objective is well established.,5
92634,It's clear and offers a very good foundation. Supplementary material is helpful. However in my view the course needs more practical illustrations of how some of the different strategy definition and approaches are practised (or not) today by modern-day companies. Some of the material was too abstract and was somewhat difficult to relate to.,3
92635,Nice course and Tutor :),5
92636,"This is a highly recommended course and the content is second to no other on Coursera at the time of this review. I have taken all of the courses in the series from Copenhagen Business School, as well as nearly all other business management courses offered for other institutions. This specific course on Strategic Management is the single most informative and current material of all of the options. It does not answer every question or address every concept you would need to know to run a major corporation, but it is a fantastic overview of past and present methods of business strategy, and is of value to any business minded individual.I highly recommend this course and the entire series from CBS. Enjoy!",5
92637,"This happens to be my first e-certification course. I am very much pleased with with course content and delivery of the same. The videos are really effective and successfully communicated the concepts. The learnings are immense and I hope to enrol for many more valued courses in future. These are really really great learnings and irrespective of the fact whether the industry accept the certifications or not, it is always important for the individual's learning curve.",5
92638,"Great course! :)But I believe the last modules were a little bit easier than the first ones... :) More concepts at the beginning and then more well-known case studies. They could have found a way to split both theory and practical teaching along the modules. Anyways: well done, CBS! I really liked this course! Cheers from Rio, Brazil.Rhai",4
92639,Brilliant course! This Course provided me with detailed information on the science and history of strategic management.,5

92651,Worth it. Comfortable pace of learning yet challenging!,5
92652,The structure and content of the course is excellent. The further reading materials provided by the lecturer are impressive and go deep within the subject matter of the course.,5
92653,"Really great course to pursue , Robert has explained each concepts in great detail.",5
92654,"I had rated this course 4 star earlier but, I am downgrading it to 2 star now as the course managers - coursera + CBS seem to have abandoned the coursera while the program is still running and being charged upwards of hundreds of dollars.The final peer assignment date has passed by close to 2 weeks and the grading process is not completed, neither there is any communication from course managers about the same.Very disappointing from Coursera and CBS. For free, the course may be still useful as early introduction to strategy but as paid course, refrain for the time being.My earlier review below.-----Delivery of the course - presentation, videos, sequencing and articles for each video are very well organized and executed. Referring cases studies is good as well.However, the material seems simplified and is very much a basic course and not intermediate or advanced course.Additionally, the quizzes are very simple and have ample room to increase the difficulty level in order to make the course more challenging.",2

92661,"Enjoyed this course, helped me understand that strategy is not rocket science :)",5
92662,Content is great. The final project pier feedback/grading could be upgraded. Prefer only one person reviewing in depth than 3 using multiple choice questions. Scales might work better.,4
92663,"Only one the first week of course and the teaching is really well done. Many explanations and details that help you to exactly understand the sense of ""strategic management""",5
92664,Great,5
92665,"Wonderful course with very clear and precise information, extremely well explained making easy to understand every single topic. I guess they used lots of strategy experience into how to transfer knowledge. Thank you very much for the high quality content.",5
92666,Only 4 stars because the Assignment was a bit of a disaster for non-professionals in Strategic Management.,4
92667,A very good course which helps in understanding the basic strategy management principles,5

92729,I thank you for so interesting content.,5
92730,very useful!,5
92731,"Very well presented and documented course! Excellent introduction to Strategic Management, it's founding concepts, influencers and how it is changing the way we do business. Can't wait to start Strategic formulation course!",5
92732,"The actual material in the course is fascinating and quite useful but, as is common with so many Coursera courses, the enjoyment of completing the course is severely hampered by the requirement to review the final assignment of other students. The purposes of these courses is to learn from experts in the field not to grade the work of others. I wish Coursera would really stop professors from pushing their responsibility- grading the work of the students and offering THEIR feedback- onto the students who may or may not have a firm grasp of the material in question.",1
92733,Quite good - great examples. Complete and easy to follow.,4
92734,The best Strategic Management course I've ever attend (and actually continuing it!) on MOOC platform!,5
92735,I like the way that this Course's brought to Students.,4
92736,"The course is very interesting but there is a problem with the quizzes, it doesn't accept correct questions. If needed I can provide a screen shot of the problem in one of the quizzes. Hope that all this will be fixed and I'll be able to take the course again.",1
92737,Very systematic and well organized course and the resources are rich.,5
92738,"Important analysis of the concepts of strategic management, reinforcing the new approach we have to give to strategy in face of the change of business environment due to the technological revolution.",5
92739,"I learned a lot of the basics in R with this course.Sometimes it is a bit of a dissonance between the lessons and the assignments, and the programming style in the lessons might seem a bit old fashioned or cumbersome, but for good reason. There are a lot of packages in R than makes you do things easy, but knowing the base is very important. The practical assignments are challenging and fun. The video lessons are good. A big minus for misleading/unclear descriptions on how to deliver your assignments. A big plus for the peer review process.",4
92740,Its a tough course. Need more help within the assignments.,5
92741,"Excellent course for someone new to R programming, some of the assignment really test your temperament and tempts you to cheat,but you just need to keep your calm and continue trying.",5
92742,A fantastic class for people familiar with R - it will take a lot of catching up if you've never used R before.,5
92743,Very usefull,5
92744,One of the best courses available online!!,5
92745,Peer review doesnt make sense. I would appreciate if TA or Instructor reviews it.,4
92746,Great introduction to R programming,5
92747,"Although the information on the course states that it requires no prior programming knowledge, that statement isn't accurate. You will quickly become lost in the assignments and questions as they are a not a logical progression from the lecture material. The instruction from Mr Peng is all over the place and doesn't give you a good understanding of the language. I found SWIRL to be 100% more helpful. But looking at the upcoming materials, you need to have a solid background in programming to complete this specialization. Which SHOULD have been told to students prior to them spending money on the course. I would NOT recommend this course to anyone.",1
92748,"Programming assignment is not fully covered in the lectures, prefer to have subject metter completely covered instead of searching for everything online.",4
92749,"Great course. I've now a better understanding of R language as the practices and assignments challenged me to think beyond the code. Of course, a lot of good information exists in Google, but the basics given in the course were the basics to understand all that information that is surrounding.",5
92750,Quite difficult to digest for a beginner. Hope the examples are easier.,3
92751,really helpful,5
92752,Programming assignments can be little more explanatory,4
92753,I really enjoyed learning the course. It was useful for a first time learner such as myself to learn with ease,5
92754,Is a very useful course although you need more hours to complete it.Also you need practice a lot. Use swril to practice. It is high recommended. Thanks to the instructors,5
92755,"By the end of the course, you do start to develop the ""hacker mentality"" the course writers want you to develop. That being said, it does seem that they could have done a much better job in the video introducing core concepts that would have given non-programmers a better starting point for looking for outside researchers. A ton of time is wasted in the earliest set of videos on super basic topics, but then the course jumps into some very advanced topics with little attention paid to core concepts except by the mentors in the forums. If these really are ""core concepts"", as described by the mentors, one would think that the teachers would spend time on those concepts in the videos instead of on more arcane use cases (which are precisely the sorts of thing it makes sense to look for in other sources). It really does seem that the teachers have no concept of what is critical content for beginners, given this odd imbalance of tons of time on extremely basic topics, tons of time on fairly advanced topics, and almost no time on critical intermediate-level content.",2
92756,"Great to learn. But some of the assignment instructions were not clear enough, and took a lot of time to figure out.",4
92757,Great course!,5
92758,"Thank you so much for sharing an awesome knowledge that everyone would like to come across.It feels a pleasure that i have been R certified from Johns Hopkins University, through Coursera.",5
92759,"I think that the course is good but the assignements are totally not at the same level of the explanations, except for the last assignement. The last assigment provided more information and more hints.",3
92760,"It is indeed very instructional! I really learned a lot with each assignment, some have been easy and some have been hard to work, but in the end everything is well explained.",5
92761,"Possibly the least well structured class ever. Also, not made for people to actually learn how to program in R. It is sad that I paid for this, and ended up going to another resource to learn... and it was much much easier.",1
92762,Exceptionally well explained most of the aspects of programming in R.Thank you!,5
92763,Good starter course for R,5
92764,Could do a better job of teaching more of the fundamentals involved in the Programming Assignments.,3
92765,Very good course :3,5
92766,A perfect opening to the programming world,5
92767,Thanks for the way the content is organised.,5
92768,"The ask in the fist assignment was not formulated correctly. Felt the class needed more hands on learning. Although the lectures were clear and concise, going back to them really didn't help me with the assignments.",2
92769,the assignments were very hard to understand. the course videos were poor.,1
92770,A very good introductory course to R for a beginner like me,5
92771,Why is this review never stored?,4
92772,"This course is definitely a must for anyone and everyone who has not worked on R (doesn't know what R is about), but has some previous exposure to basic programming! I was satisfied with what I had learnt at the end of this course!",4
92773,Very helpful session. The assignments are also challenging,5
92774,Excellent starting point for people new in data science programming,5
92775,"Best in all opinion to learn R in such a planned order ...Thank you Coursera and John Hopkins and definitely a big thanks to Prof. Roger D Peng, Jeff Leek and Brain Caffo",5
92776,"The course structure is very well crafted. The pace and learning curve goes smoothly although starting third week, you would need external resources for help. You do get to learn a lot about R as a computational language with great hands-on experience.",5
92777,"This course is too easy and more like a user manual, I wish there are more ""Why"" or ""principles"" inside. because the most important thing is to know ""why"". In my eye, ""functional programming Principles in Scala"" is this kind of real course that after taking it (it is not my priority right now so I will delay to finish it for a while). I can get the sense of the most important feature of a new language.",3
92778,Simply Awesome !!,5
92779,Very nice class.,5
92780,Course is informative and assignments are helping you to learn more. Interactive exercises provided by swirl package are great to have hands-on experience on the functions. I will highly recommend this course and swirl package to my friends. Thanks!,4
92781,"good, can we have mini project as well, so that we have more hands-on to R?",4
92782,The homework is more harder than what I learned. The errors in speaking made me uncomfortable.,3
92783,It is the best!,5
92784,Love the way teaching and assignment works here!,5
92785,"The Swirl practice exercises are great, they're optional but I would highly recommend doing those.The graded assignments are pretty difficult considering only the basic concepts are discussed in the lectures, you definitely need to do some trial and error in R to figure out what you're doing.",4
92786,I have no background in R and thus benefited a lot from this course. It took me quite a while to figure out the programming assignments. I wish the course could provide more baby programming assignments to practice for beginners like me.,4
92787,"The real deal if you want to know how to program in R, this is the right course.",5
92788,An excellent course to get to know the basics of R programming. The practice material and the assignments really instill the material being taught in your mind.,5
92789,"Great course! It is the second course of the Data Science Specialisation I have finished so far, and I really enjoy how it goes. However, in my option, some assignments lack clear instructions, what still does not prevent students to complete the course.",5
92790,very hard course. Very time in mind comsuming.,4
92791,"Well designed for beginners to intermediate programmers analytics, Pay much attention on swirl, and other additional literature.",5
92792,very well explained. Excellent for an introduction to R!,5
92793,The course was very entertaining and useful. You can learn a lot about R programming and the quality of the professors is just incredible. It is also very nice that professors made material for the course that can be downloaded for free in Leanpub (people from developing countries is very grateful for that).,5
92794,Great course! Totally recommended.,5
92795,"A very simplest , easiest and effective mode of teaching.",5
92796,Effective use of time. Jumped into useful things immediately.,4
92797,"Hands down!, The very best course in R programming for beginners.",5
92798,Good lessons and very good assignments,4
92799,The course content was well delivered. Assignments were challenging but very useful to help get the learner up to speed with programming on R independently.,5
92800,Extra-ordinary Course - Well structured course -Best forum for learning R programming,5
92801,very nice swirl in effectively amazing it helps me alot thank for the every thing,5
92802,Great Course,5
92803,This is a crash course into R-Programming. If you have never did any programming this course will be a challenge! But it is a good way to get going with R-programming.,5
92804,There is a huge disconnect between the lectures and what is asked in the homework assignments.,1
92805,Not practical for beginners. Probably useful if you already have extensive experience with other programming languages.,3
92806,Can I still pass the course even if I started late?,5
92807,Excellent Training,5
92808,It was very informative..and excellent,5
92809,More code and result demonstration would be better for understanding.,4
92810,Must have course on R programming for beginners. Quiz and assignments were engaging as well as challenging.,5
92811,"Beautifully designed,Crisp and Elegant.",5
92812,"challenging assignments, very beneficial",5
92813,Solid introduction to the syntax and data science applications of R,5
92814,"If you don't have experience programming, this course is probably impossible without extensive online research to complete assignments. Perhaps this is a good thing - I guess we're supposed to be learning how to 'hack' our education and find answers on our own in the future as we lead our own projects. Still, being a complete noob, I would have prefered a more robust introduction to the language. In the end, however, I did feel relatively competent (good enough to be dangerous to myself) in R after 4 weeks.",4
92815,I really want to take moment to appreciate the careful designing of course material. Start from basic and touched every major point of programming. At least we can take this knowledge ahead and use this in more real world scenario. This has given me enough encouragement to stay connected for future guidance. Kudos to Course designers and Coursera.,5
92816,Really good and explanatory for beginners. Quite useful to in understanding the basics,5
92817,Really satisfying when your functions finally begin to work!!!,5
92818,"quite tough for someone without R-programming background, should add in more explanation in the course to help beginner passing the quiz",4
92819,"This was a pretty demanding course but in the end, it was so rewarding. I wish it was a little easier though. Also, it took me months to finish due to work and other engagements. I wish I could have stuck with it week over week. I believe that it would've taken less time if I had done that.",5
92820,Not the best course for beginners. Too much theory and no implementation. Also the assignments were impossible for a beginner.,1
92821,"This course is very bad. I would like to say this course sucks compared with my sql course no matter how it is structured or how the instructor conducted the course. The instructor is very boring and does not explain very clearly. Even when I start, he does not clearly clarify how to start to use R. He was just talking about what the powerpoint shows. I will absolutely not recommend this course if you are beginners. (0 STAR)I will give a little credit to swirl, a practical tool provided by this course to learn R by yourself thought the instruction of the R program itself. But for the later part of swirl, it's confusing sometimes. However, I learnt much more from swirl rather than from the instructor. I can't understand what he is talking about but you have to make it clear thru using swirl. He said the swirl is an optional part but he does not realized what he shows is much worse than swirl. (2 STARS)Overall, I don't recommend this anyone, especially if you are beginners.",2
92822,"It is an excellent introduction to R. It required me to do more reading than what was provided via videos and slide decks. Without that additional reading it wasn't possible to complete the assignments. Loved the forum and the mentors. Both are a great help. Lastly, I think a couple more assignments would help.",5
92823,Very good intro to R programming,5
92824,"Very good lectures. Intense programming assignments worked well, got me up to speed with the basics of R. I would recommend this course.",5
92825,"Love Coursera but was disappointed in this course. Being a true beginner w/no background in programming or data science, I felt the programming assignments were way too far a stretch from the Swirl exercises (which I felt were super helpful and beginner appropriate) and lectures. I spent 8-12 hrs on each one just googling and trying to decipher the programming jargon that most responses were written in. I was able to figure out workable code for most problems but I feel like I am still lacking the basic fundamentals underlying the solutions to these assignments and would have a hard time reproducing solutions to similar problems.",2
92826,"Great courses -- the only thing I would improve if possible, would be more incremental steps leading up to assignments. Swirl was a lifesaver for this, but I would love more Swirl exercises to get the hang of each topic.",4
92827,"I believe it is a great course, but its pretty hard to catch up how to code if u dont have basics of general coding: logical thinking and problem solving aproach.",4
92828,It is a very good introduction to R programming.Week 2 and Week 4 assignments were specially hard for me.,4
92829,"Very simple course instruction and materials with difficult programming assignments. I understand having a student stretch for an assignment, but this seems more like incomplete instruction. Definitely a lot of work if you only have a statistical programming background.",3
92830,Challenging and engaging course. Learnt a lot.,5
92831,"As someone with little programming experience, this course was extremely challenging and I don't think the information taught was enough to successfully complete the course. I had to go to another online education source to teach myself R before I could do the Coursera programming assignments.",2
92832,Swirl was very useful,4
92833,Brilliant!,5
92834,Well formulated course,5
92835,Excellent course for learning and practicing,5
92836,"This course just pushes you to the large world of R to explore, experiment and learn.",5
92837,"By far this the best course ever for learning R. It's unbelievably tough, but I guess that is how people learn.",5
92838,Great class for getting started in R Programming. Good homework assignments to learn many tasks for building toward more complicated uses of R.,5
92839,Quizes are informative. Assignments are challenging but not too much so. 10/10. Roger is also a great teacher.,5
92840,"Well taught and incredibly useful course. R is a great language for statistical computing and data science, and this course provides a well-paced introduction to the language and some important features.",5
92841,"Swirl is very good. it would be good if it detected differences in input for a typo error, compared to a guess, and also if it ignores results if the expected outcome is achieved e.g. sqrt(x) and (x^0.5). i'm sure a clever identical() function in there could produce a responsive feedback like. ""OK, not quite what I was thinking, you should have type sqrt(x), but you seem to have managed to get t",4
92842,Work!!,5
92843,perfect course ever，It's a good choice for new learner to study!R <- best language!,5
92844,there were several things required in the programming that was not covered in lessons. Without help from other programmers and googling a lot I could not have done this. Very complex for beginners. Also documents not updated with current information,3
92845,Great Experience! Learned a lot.,5
92846,Very interesting course - Thank you.,3
92847,Really well organized and compact. A nice introduction to working with R. A plus for showing were to look for further resources.,5
92848,Tip of the iceberg. Gentle introduction to R - together with Swirl it is a proper introduction.,5
92849,I think what's most worthing is swirl introduced in the course.,5
92850,A very good course and discussion board is the greatest help where you got directions to which area you need to explore to find answers.,5
92851,the course design is great! I found the exercises in swirl is interesting!I learn a lot in short 4 weeks! @Roger thank you!,5
92852,Challenging and educational. I learned way more things that I expected. I would just like to mention that there is a difference in difficulty between videos and assignments.,5
92853,The homework and the lectures are at totally different level.,2
92854,"The exams and projects are really really hard and make R newbies, such as I, feel very suffering. And these contents are not connect to the teaching materials closely. I think there is large space to improve this course to make it more accessible and learnable.",2
92855,"This course is basic but the fist necessary step for anyone who want to be a master. The more your practice, the more you will learn from this course.",4
92856,Great Learning and I would recommend the Swi,4
92857,Good introduction. But could go more in depth.,4
92858,Excellent with a lot of basic knowledge in R programming with some comprehensive assignments. It's good.,5
92859,Great foundation to programming in R. Will continue to use as a reference as I expand my skills!,5
92860,great course! thanks for all the details and materials.,5
92861,Very interesting course with great base of knowlage. Easy enough to understand for new members and interesting for R-lovers.Mostly I like the Programming assignments!Thank you!,5
92862,"I passed this course with score 95% finished all quizzes, Programming assignments and swirl exercises. but it wasn't useful that much. the videos wasn't interactive, to much theoretical parts...less practical you can't solve the assignments depending on the tutorials you have to google for the answers and know how people can solve the problems.......I recommend if there will be a new version to put these points in consideration",2
92863,"there is a wide gap between the videos, practice assignments and completing the required projects.",3
92864,"Good course, especially for writing functions! At times, the assignments haunted me, but patience and reading the forums and blogs is the key.",5
92865,absoultley loved the course and while giving assignments we cannot completly relay on course content.,5
92866,Excellent class. I have come out with amazing R knowledge and ability.,5
92867,its good,5
92868,Nicely organized for beginners.Suggest for more information and lectures on data frame and functions on data frames.,5
92869,"I am pleasantly surprised with the quality of this course. For a beginner, the Swirl exercises are incredibly helpful and I was able to build confidence in working with R because of them. Thank you!",5
92870,A very good course!,5
92871,Damn near worthless. The course material has significant gaps of information. The programming assignments require knowledge that isn't presented in the course. I had to Google my way through this entire course. I would not recommend it.,1
92872,"The course is Awesome. I liked the hospital Exercise, but it would be great if you can add more optional exercises like this one.",5
92873,A great course with great teachers. I'd recommend it to anyone who'd ask me.,5
92874,"Good course, but needs in depth discussion on few topics.",4
92875,Very helpful!,5
92876,Instructor's video is not very helpful,4
92877,I have done the previous course in the series that is The Data Science Tool box. So with that in mind I think this course is exceptionally well made. I thoroughly enjoyed the whole course and the assignments.,5
92878,"Even though the video lectures, discussion forums, swirl & reading resources are informative, there is a huge disconnect between the assignments & what is taught. It is impractical for people who have just been introduced to R(with no background in programming) to take up this course.The graded assignments should be made simpler or should be preceded by smaller ones which help first-timers get used to coding in R. I do not think Swirl; even though a valuable resource; achieves this task remotely.",3
92879,Really good course.,4
92880,The instructor gave us homework on materials that were not taught in the lectures. This was a little unfair. It may be the way to teach for in-person learning but it is frustrating for an online course. Others have commented on the rapid pace. I would not mind the rapid pace if the materials presented were also the ones tested.,3
92881,The concepts were explained in a clear and understandable fashion. The functions in the programming assignments were of a higher standard compared to what is taught in the course !,5
92882,nice to learn:)),3
92883,Enjoy much solving the problems raised by creating a script in R!,5
92884,Swirl package really gave a lot. The lectures I find to be at times a bit slow-paced. All in all a great course.,4
92885,"A reasonable primer for R programing, that covers the basics of manipulating data sets. There are a couple of spots where the code is out of date, but that can be easily worked around.",4
92886,Great course,5
92887,"Really good course, and structured in a way that you have to do a lot of thinking, reading, and research for yourself - forcing you to learn and explore.",5
92888,covers the basics well.,4
92889,"Feels like there is an extreme disconnect from the tutorials/lectures and the programming assignments. The programming assignments, were at times, rather difficult and had little to do with the lectures from that week. Overall I feel like I have a decent base in R, however I still feel like a lot of concepts were lost/not explained thoroughly enough.",3
92890,Very poor lecture support for the assignments. So much was not covered at all during the lectures that the assignments were extremely time consuming.,2
92891,This is a very good place to start if you want a career in data science. I really learnt a lot and currently using it my data analysis projects. I would recommend this course to any one who likes to work with data.,4
92892,Very good course to get started with R language.,5
92893,Good course to start off your R Journey. It is guided and has enough validation mechanisms to reinforce your learning. Thanks John Hopkins Team to put this together.,5
92894,This is a great course to start using R,4
92895,Good Course. The lectures are useful. But you will need to search a lot to complete your assignments!,4
92896,Very hard for a beginner. Lacks the slow build up I needed. Missing an explanation about a comma cost me about 4 hours. The assignments are brutal which encourages cheating.,1
92897,Great course to learn the R programming.,5
92898,"This course is about elementary R programming , but programming assignments are not entry level. They are challenge for freshman. Overall it a good course to enter R programming.",4
92899,If you've never programmed before this will be difficult. Great intro to R!!,5
92900,very useful tool and interactive way of learning.,5
92901,"The course is really good, intense, and ... hard ! I guess that more assignements in swirl are better to get people more used to the tool instead of just leaving them with a huge, deep Programming Assignement for them to complete.",4
92902,"Thank you! This course is excelent. It gave me a great overview, what all is possible in R.",5
92903,"Honestly, I'm very disappointed with this course. The content taught in this course is not in accordance with the assignments. It is like someone taught to be a builder and asked to build the Brooklyn Bridge ... Not fair at all.If you are going to ask to build a bridge, teach me how. If you teach me how to be a builder ask me for a wall, not a bridge.",1
92904,Very good course.,5
92905,Great course for very beginners,5
92906,"I finished this last year with a good background already in R. However, this course took a lot of time, a lot of stackoverflow searching and generally a lot of work! Now that I'm a year removed from the course, I can say that it's been one of the better, more rigorous, more practical and more applicable courses i've taken. I still spend A GREAT DEAL of my time looking for answers online but now the questions and tasks are much more complex now that I've taken my programming skills to higher levels, with lots of thanks to this course!",5
92907,I've taken a bunch of online programming courses. This one is the best. I loved the swirl package exercises. They make R very easy to learn. The tips in the discussion forums are very helpful for getting assignments completed.,5
92908,This is an excellent course to start learning R.,5
92909,"This is exceptionally nice program, it really give me a great sense of R and some absolutely fascinating skill to work with data. Lecture are really well drafted and pretty comfortable in understanding, mentor are responsive and replied as quickest as possible. Looking forward to gain the expertise in R programming.",5
92910,"A challenge for the beginner, lots is covered, little is explained about the completion of the projects. An excelent challenge for the investigative minded. Highly recommended, but not for the unitiated without conviction or the faint of heart.",4
92911,It is a very well taught and organised course!,5
92912,"Clear video lectures, all presentation files are provided and kept up to date. Swirl is particularly useful. What is missing to my taste is more reading recommendation, not only the books from the instructors. Otherwise, I think it is a good course to start with R.",5
92913,huge gap from lectures and swirl to the assignments.,1
92914,"Overall pretty good. Since I have no computer science background, some of the assignments were a bit challenging for me and the Swirl assignments were not particularly helpful. Overall, I feel like I learned the basics of programming in R and after completing the course I was able to write some simple programs that I can use in my day to day activities in the lab.",4
92915,It's a excelent course to begin in R Programming.,5
92916,Great course for R beginners to get familiar with the basic functions of the program!,5
92917,Great instruction by teachers and a good collection of assignments. A great way to learn R for beginners.,5
92918,"Great introductory course to the R language. Nice challenges along the way, which made me research more details about the language.",5
92919,Great course... learnt a lot.. thank you Coursera,5
92920,The material is hard to take in for first time learner and the assignment is too difficult compared to what taught.,4
92921,Difficult but a challenging course,5
92922,"I have completed only first week while providing the review, Professor has made very complex contents very simple, which he would have learned through years in a organized manner , I appreciate the SWIRL package which helps to provide a hands on with a guided tour ... Thanks ......",5
92923,"Nice and challenging! Thanks so far.The assignments are somewhat hard, but not too hard. Forced me to sit down and think.That's very good.",5
92924,wonderful course.,5
92925,"Excellent hands on intro to R, great for anyone looking to get into data science space",5
92926,Just Awesome,5
92927,"Good introduction and definitely helps get started! Given we have video lectures, concepts could have been explained better by demonstrating on the R console instead of showing static slides and verbal explanation.",3
92928,"Awesome, as always. Peng rocks, explains everything and also makes textbooks available. GREAT COURSE!",5
92929,this is the real time learning and programming R,5
92930,Great course for introducing syntax and gaining comfort in the Rstudio environment.,5
92931,"Needs more structure on R logic, development of R functions were very challenging. I would recommend maybe extending the course one more week to cover in depth the logic of R objects and functions and the lexical scope with practical exercises. Expand swirl() with more challenging commands.",4
92932,well designed and easy to learn! thank you Coursera and Johns Hopkins University.,5
92933,challenging but definitely very gratifying and useful!,5
92934,swirl is great learning tool,4
92935,"Roger Peng is a excellent teacher, I really liked his book (R programming)",5
92936,was fun! thanks :),5
92937,Really helpful!,5
92938,"This course is a great place to start learning R (and any programming language at all). Due to it I fell in love with R and the whole domain of data science. Do I recommend it? Yes! Thanks, JHU!",5
92939,I highly recommend this course for any one who wants to get hands-on experience with R programming for the first time. I enjoyed the lecturers approach in teaching this course and the accompanying exercises.,5
92940,An amazing course! I have had some experience programming in R but this course helped me take my programming to the next step. I highly recommend this course for any level of programmer. It is a great course to have in your back pocket.,5
92941,It would be nice to have more complicated assignments which push brain to work harder,4
92942,I enjoyed the course. It challenged me more than I expected. Be sure to begin your assignments early. Don't wait until the last day!,5
92943,"Good, but I expected more exercises.",4
92944,The assignment doesn't correspond with the content of classes closely.,3
92945,I wish to learn the language and master it. The course provides very good understanding of the basic concepts,4
92946,The course provides a good explanation on important concepts of R and the assignments are designed well to hone the Programming Skills needed to tread Datascience.,5
92947,"I have been programming in R for years, but I did learn some new things in this course!",5
92948,Good course.,4
92949,Nice coverage of concepts,5
92950,My name is Jose Antonio. I am looking for a new Data Scientist career ( https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseantonio11)I did this course to get new knowledge about Data Science and better understand the technology and your practical applications.The course was excellent and the classes well taught by the Teachers.Congratulations to Coursera team and Teachers,5
92951,The course coverage is really good. The video lectures can have more examples from real time projects. The assignments are truly challengjng.,4
92952,Nice course. Learned a lot.,4
92953,"Nice introduction to R language.Because one thing can done by several way, and after learning about different methods, in beginning it's becoming confusing what to use.",5
92954,great course,5
92955,"It is just not a good course for a beginner, especially the assignment 2 is hard to understand. And hope this course can add a little bit material on statistical programming or machine learning session in the future.",2
92956,"I think it was a good course, but the examples are basic while the assesments were pretty hard. Maybe it'd be splitted in two different courses.",4
92957,Great learning.,5
92958,"Love the course contents, and everything is nice explained",5
92959,4* and not 5* for locked quizzes,4
92960,Great Course,5
92961,Need more practical exercises.,4
92962,"Exellent for beginner.I literally didn't know anything about R, and was not familiar with programming.This course gave me a step for advanced data programming.",5
92963,I just loved the course. Swirl() really helped in practise of each concept.,5
92964,"Good intention but the programming assignments were much much harder than what was covered in the mostly theoretical lectures and the more practical but not as advanced swirl exercises. After reading other reviews of this course, and struggling to complete the FIRST programming assignment, I canceled. Please do not advertise this as for beginners - I think people who have had some programming experience before would find this great, but not for the newbie.",2
92965,Great to kickstart your R programming skills.A bit basic sometimes and exercices are not very advanced.,4
92966,Steep learning curve but the resources to succeed are there.,4
92967,"Great course to get your feet wet. As a complete beginner to R with a very small amount of prior programming experience, the programming assignments took me around 4-8 hours each. The swirl() exercises were very helpful in reinforcing lecture information.",5
92968,Really wonderful course! This course is informatic and the assignment is in great help for a beginner in R. Thanks for your work!,5
92969,The course was great but could be even better if the examined assignments would be more related to the actual course. The level here is very different. It would be great if more exercises could be introduced that lead to the more difficult assignments in the course.,4
92970,"It is well-organized.I don't know why but compared with the lectures, I prefer the swirl tool they use in this course...",4
92971,"I do not like how the lecturer teaches. It is too theoretical, and from very simple concepts makes rocket science. It would be better to have more exmaple and less theory.",2
92972,Simple and easy introduction to main concepts in R.,4
92973,This is a great course to start learning R. The material is clear and the the topics are well structured,5
92974,"Wonderful course, it forced me to depend on myself. I had to search, I had to read and go through lots of articles, questions, solutions and tutorials online and also, in the discussion board to solve the assignments. I believe it is the best way for someone to get knee deep and learn the language. This is exactly the methodology that should be followed in the real world. One would have to search and find solutions for any issues that are encountered. I enjoyed it and moving on to completing the specialization.",5
92975,This is a very good course to master R fundamentals.,5
92976,Very good course for anyone willing to learn R. I started with no knowledge of R. This course gave me a solid start. I have built my knowledge over it and I am very comfortable with R now.,5
92977,Very good course. But the final test was too difficult. Almost impossible without external help for people like me with no experience in programming,4
92978,This course is great for learning R and lots of basics.,5
92979,"Hard, but GREAT!",5
92980,Thanks for the excellent course!,5
92981,"I understand that it must be a great challenge trying to teach R in four weeks. I feel the lectures were clear, the supplemental swirl assignments were beneficial, and that the discussion boards were fruitful. However, the assignments were ridiculous. Google is your friend with this course, as always, but if you're looking to gain a lot from this course, pay close attention to the lectures and the supplemental assignments in swirl. The assignments, in my opinion, were beyond the scope of the lectures and supplemental assignments.",3
92982,"Video lectures were useful and thorough, but the assignments included some materials and concepts that were not even talked about, which poses a huge problem for beginners. Maybe try splitting up R Programming into two levels, one for beginners and another for more advanced individuals?",4
92983,"Great course, covering the various details in depth.",5
92984,There is a large gap between the course material and the assignments. Requires A LOT of extra research to complete if you do not have prior R experience.,3
92985,Instructor doesn't seem to be passionate about giving the lecture,1
92986,"The course gave good beginning to R programming. It will be good if you can add more examples, use cases, real time scenarios(explaining where that function can be used) when you teach. Assignments are of good standard. They made me to learn more about R. Overall, it gave a good exposure. If possible, add one mini project kind of thing along with assignments.",4
92987,Pretty Robust!,5
92988,"Very good. Even though that it is not completely required to know statistics for this course, I would suggest putting in the requirements something like ""basic statistics"". For example, I don't need to know about the Poisson distribution in order to apply its function, but at least I might want to know why is it useful to apply those kind of functions.",5
92989,"Nice course, but the gap between video lessons and programming assignments was too wide for me. Would have loved more guidance towards the assignments.",3
92990,Videos are a bit monotonous.,4
92991,The videos were informative but i didn't feel like we used the concepts from the videos very frequently.,4
92992,"Not meant for a complete beginner. I've spoken to a dozen people who have taken this course, and if you don't have some programming skills, you'll struggle. I'm not suggesting its not doable for the complete beginner, but the time commitment may be prohibitive.",2
92993,Its one of the best courses and I have improved a lot,5
92994,I would rate this as the best source of knowledge for any beginner who wish to start/change their carrier to data analysis. Would recommend buying book R programming for Data Science. This book covers all the materials of this lesson and also can be a reference book whenever you need any reference in future.,5
92995,"Very Good for beginners. I learned basics in R in a short time. I recommend to finish all project without help, it seems hard first but after some thinking and research they helped me to understand R language structures",5
92996,The videos do not adequately prepare the students of the programming assignments.The instructor should provide more support regarding the homework.,2
92997,Vey Good Coursebut it need more Example and Practial session,4
92998,R programming language is introduced with all the functions and techniques that can be used for data science. The exercises and assignments are very nice to work on and help to better understand the power of functions.,5
92999,Great course. Learned a lot.,5
93000,"The swirl exercises are very good. The assignments are quite challenging but enjoyable. The last one took me > 9 hrs. I would suggest to first give a sample assignment. And then in the theory discuss the tools for that assignment. And then give the assignment. The theory is a lot of explanation - which I am battling to ""hook"" onto something. Why - because I had not been exposed to an application opportunity. The text in the slides are too small to view on a phone. Overall I feel proud to have completed the course and it gives me confidence to attempt problems with R.",4
93001,Great Course!,5
93002,"The course was great. Having no background in programming languages is surely a set back to complete this course. The first time I enrolled for this course, I cant go any further than a week. But in my second attempt I was determined to complete it and I did it. What I understand is, if you have passion to learn R , this is a nice course but you cant rely on the class teaching alone, there are quite a number of blogs from where you can get help to complete this course. I felt a huge gap between assignments and the teaching; means, one has to struggle a bit to complete the assignments. But may be thats how one can get better with the nuts and bolts of R. Again, the course discussion forum and a few blogs can guide you through to understand and complete the assignments.",4
93003,"I learned a great deal in this course about manipulating data in R. It was challenging enough with a programming background, but not too time-consuming with my busy schedule.",5
93004,Great,5
93005,Excelent course ! It is very fun in my view,5
93006,"It was great, though tough",4
93007,"Swirl package contents were better than the lectures in the videos. The video lectures introduced concepts without any context, making them difficult to understand. The video lectures also didn't demonstrate anything. The Swirl package was much better at ""showing one,"" ""doing one.""",2
93008,"Great introduction to R programming that provides you with the skills to manipulate data in R including understanding the basics of vector type operations, functions and debugging.",5
93009,"Good exercises. While the concepts are presented in lecture, without some discussion my grasp of the material is weak. swirl() helps immensely - the programming exercises are really key for learning the concepts. The discussion groups [TIPS] kept me in the game.",5
93010,"I had really high hopes for this course. I am not a programmer, though in college I learned C, C++, and used MATLAB a fair amount. I wanted to learn R because it is a free software versus paying a licencing fee to use SPSS which I have done in the past. I had already completed the first week of the course and the first week in this course. I went through the slides and I didn't really feel like I learned any actual programming so then to expect to answer questions where you had to program seemed a bit out of left field. As a comparison it felt like they had an hour worth of slides talking about different trees and how to differentiate them then asked you to drive a tank.I then took the time go through two swirl assignments which I hoped was going to fill in the many gaps left by the slides. They were definitely more helpful than the slide show, but I still felt like they would teach you how to add then ask you to multiply.So in general my recommendation would be not to take the course unless you have a fairly solid understand of programming, otherwise you will do what I did and just wasted $50.",1
93011,"Overall, this course was fairly challenging and at times I would get frustrated, but every minute was worth it after realizing the knowledge I have gained and have been able to use in the real world. I think sometimes the assignments just kind of dive right in and there's not much hand-holding, but that can be a good thing. My only suggestion would be to extend the course from 4 to 6 weeks and spread out the material a bit, but overall, you just have to be committed and make time.",5
93012,very helpful， easy to comprehend and follow,5
93013,"Can move too quickly at times, but is very informative. I have learned more than I expected in a short period of time.",4
93014,Nice course to develop the basic programming in R and getting started,5
93015,Provides basic concepts in R.Recommended for any beginner,4
93016,Challenging yet rewarding course for programming beginners!,5
93017,"Overall course was good. I think there is a bit of a gap in terms of helping providing additional understanding of application of some the concepts in context of a solution. I think the course does a good job explaining the concept, but I feel the course could use some additional examples of application of the concepts to help facilitate the programming assignments. The Swirl exercise are good...but almost seem to rudimentary.",4
93018,Swirl exercises are very helpful,5
93019,Shorten the course will be better for participants,4
93020,Excelente course! I will recommend it to my collegues,5
93021,very useful for learning from scratch.,5
93022,cool,5
93023,Swirl is best thing to learn,5
93024,Great introduction,5
93025,"Thank you Coursera!!!! Class methods were easy to follow, and the help on the forum was great!",5
93026,"Excellent course for the subject. Challenging assignments, helpful instructors.",5
93027,All the explanations are clear and straight to the point. The pace of leaning is perfect. It covers everything one need to get started with R.,5
93028,Would like to see more examples.,4
93029,"Challenging for those without programming experience. But with hard work and forum, you can do it.",4
93030,It's a good course,5
93031,"Easy enough to achieve what is asked, but hard enough to force you to learn how to use the program.",5
93032,"This R course is quite overwhelming for those who start learning R. R course from Duke university will walk through from step by step. From that, this would be wonderful to learn R from John Hopkins university.",4
93033,Great course!,5
93034,"The course is challenging and the exams use real-world data.The sequence of the course is not linear, the exams are too difficult compared to the material covered in classes.",3
93035,It is worth to do it,5
93036,"Had potential, but exercises and quizzes do not align with content taught by professor. This is not a beginners course!",2
93037,great course,5
93038,"The swirl exercises were helpful, but the video lectures and assignments were not. Therefore, I cannot recommed this course. There are better resources for learning R in general and R programming.",2
93039,It was very useful. The assignments helped me learn the concepts in depth.,5
93040,"This course was great , I learned a lot from it and I am motivated to continue learning",5
93041,Excellent! The course has an easy and kind format to new R-programmers.,5
93042,Solid course overall only complaint is the programming assignments are a bit difficult to do based on what is taught in the lectures.,3
93043,"Very good step-by-step introduction to R. Requires a lot of practice with the language, which is the best to way to learn it.",5
93044,The course is very useful and provides a good platform for data analytics through R Programming.,5
93045,"Excellent Course! The lectures are very well explained, the practice exercises must definitely be done for practice (like the name suggests), and every assignment and quiz should be done not from the point of view of marks but understanding the concept and logically being able to implement the task. Complete the course in all seriousness and you're in great stead to use R for analytics.",5
93046,"I loved the way that this course has been structured. In addition, the sheer number of users makes this course more enjoyable since you can get your queries solved easily.",5
93047,Nice introductory course to programming in R,5
93048,Not good for people who would like to learn from basics.,2
93049,Very clarifying!,5
93050,Good way learn R,5
93051,"Good course to get started and get you comfortable with manipulating data in R. However, does not cover object oriented programming, pivot tables or advanced plotting.",4
93052,Basics were taught but I wish it was more advanced to the point that I would feel comfortable doing data analysis in R on my own.,4
93053,"Dr. Peng is great at teaching, and the lectures are not hard to follow. The recommended e-book is almost a transcript of the lectures' examples, and I really recommend getting it (I got it on print, as I like to make annotations while following the videos).That being said, the Programming Assignments are extremely difficult for anyone with no programming background. The Assignments do not require just what is being taught, and demands a lot of google and stack overflow research in order to solve the problems. If you are doing other Coursera courses and/or working at the same time, I recommend you invest time in this and do not let the assignments for the weekends.",3
93054,Assignment 2 was a bit confusing,4
93055,Good - gets straight to the point,5
93056,Really great course. 4 stars for not allowing submissions of quizzes and program assignments without purchase.,4
93057,"Amazing Tutorial and course. The methods they use are simple but the lack of exercises in programming, its a downside. In my programming experience, it's needed more practical examples. Swirl is one side of the course that helps the user understand what R programming is, but in my opinion, different examples or projects are needed.",4
93058,very good course,5
93059,This is a great Introduction course on R.,5
93060,"This was a challenging course. I have some experience in stats, but no experience with programming so I spent an extraordinary amount of time fumbling through the assignments. However, the effort was worth it. I am far from fluent in R, but I do feel like I know how to talk in R, pose questions about code, and begin to build functions with my knowledge. Have plenty more to learn, but fumbling through this course has definitely given me a good foundation. Tips for anyone thinking of taking the course: read the discussion forums, learn to look for answers online, and be patient if you're unfamiliar with programming languages.",5
93061,awesome course for beginners,5
93062,A very good course. But i would have preferred much more exercises and may be instructor could have been a bit slow too. Overall I am quite satisfied.,4
93063,Great course and a great set of professors to guide the students. Completing this course has opened the doors for me to the data science domain.,5
93064,Good course. I would request that the instructors work through modules in real time that are similar to the quizzes.,3
93065,Great Course !THANKS !!!,5
93066,Very good. A lot of stuff covered. The explanations are great.,5
93067,"Very good course for those who have already some experience with programming, but want to learn the basics of R.",5
93068,"I could not complete it as 100% because of a bug, in week 3 quiz and week 1 quiz. in week 1 2questions will never get a correct answer. Same case with week3 quiz.",3
93069,This is a great course to learn how to program in R,5
93070,Excellent course specially for those who do not have any experience about R.,5
93071,Well laid out and planned course. Could increase the difficulty level of the homework assignments.,5
93072,Very good introductory course to R programming,5
93073,Excellent course. I am currently studying a graduate course on Electrical Power Systems and intend to use this knowledge in my career.,5
93074,awesome course!,5
93075,The swirl course is really good for solidifying the knowledge.,5
93076,"It was very informative and understandable. This course seems difficult in the beginning as we need to remember various syntactic notations. When you are in such a situation, don't forget to start using swirl. Even if you are a quick learner of syntax, swirl takes your journey like a cake walk as it just plants all the course content into your brain. It is such an interactive,student friendly environment being provided in the course that it makes you fall in love with swirl, course and instructor's methodologies.I am really thankful to John Hopkins university for such a course.",5
93077,very comprehensive for those who has a little coding background but new to R. The programming quizzes are very helpful for practicing coding. I suggest solution codes by instructors be posted.,5
93078,I think it will be more helpful if you already have some knowledge on coding.,4
93079,"Very challenging assignments! You learn a lot. Please, give more complex exercices to prepare before the final assignment.",3
93080,Very good course. A lot of materials and practical exercises.,5
93081,"Professor is very well rounded and is quite enjoyable to hear his voice! Keep up the great work, looking forward to the next sections of the data science series.",5
93082,The course teaches you very valuable basic R programming skills. It is definitely good for the beginner. Unfortunately the lectures and course materials do not adequately prepare you for the programming assignments which is frustrating and time consuming if you actually want to write the code required and not cheat.The structure and functionality of Coursera itself is excellent.,3
93083,"I had indeed to look for codecamp to practice all the small commands how to deal with vectors. Swirl does not allow you to follow up so clearly. I wish you guys could implement a little R interface so we can follow you closer.The last project quiz demands you a huge amount of time, if you do not have much experience. They could shorten a little the questions. I know that one takes to the other, but I only had time to finish the first and understand. Yes, perhaps I am not the best, but you are offering the course to people who are not born programmers.I think that it would benefit strongly from a clear distinction between how to deal with vectors, matrix, data.frame, etc. separately instead of the huge videos with bullet points of the potentialities. We need to practice more, I like theory and I know how important, but I dont think that I learn much from the lessons or quizzes how to code something like the last part. I dont think it build my knowledge until I understand how to create that script for week4. I had to look around in all the internet, buying books. Read more. Just my opinion. I think you guys could give small scripts or asking smaller tasks to lead people until they understand how to build that.Also has its positives, I really learnt great tips and technically I know a lot of R potential.",3
93084,"Good for beginner, but also very useful if you familiar with R but need hand on practical experience with the language. As my instructor would say at the University, you gonna need practice, and here is where you can start to focus on structured assignments with clear result need for each assignment. Complete the assignment and you will advance your skills in R.",5
93085,Excellent overview of the basics the practical exercises using swirl really kept me engaged.,5
93086,Assignments do not match up well with the lessons and the lessons are BAD. They are not educational.,1
93087,Excellent Work!,5
93088,Great Course!,5
93089,"Somewhat hard, but rewarding.",4
93090,"Good Lessons and exercises. I would have liked introduction to packages like dplyr, but may be that is introduced in other training modules.",4
93091,Great course.,5
93092,"It was a little difficult grasping functions as I didn't have much programming background. The swirl practice modules were great but I wish they constructed some lessons that would build a function from top to bottom like we were asked to do in the programming assignments. The lectures, swirl practice modules, and quizzes were great but they all re-iterated the same basic information. I wanted to learn and practice building more functions by applying the basic information to do complex tasks.",3
93093,"the learning curve is quite steep, requires more than just mastering what the lecturer said.",5
93094,"Nice, concise and useful set of techniques and topics to get aboard of R programming and tools.",5
93095,Love hands-on learning.,5
93096,Very nice course to learn the basics of R that is required for data science.,4
93097,Great course for people familiar with programming and want to extend their knowledge into the realm of data.,5
93098,"Learning R in 4 weeks was quite tough. I haven't done serious programming for the last 25 years but the way in which the course was structured, assisted me in getting through the difficult parts. I battled the most with the notations, ie. when to use <- or = or ==? Also things like when to use ( or [. Might sound trivial to you, but for a first timer it can be quite confusing.I have come across a few ""cheat sheets"" which has helped me a lot. I am still using it and I'm busy with course 9 now. I don't think one should call it ""cheat sheets"", rather call it ""summary sheets"". If I can make a suggestion, I would like to see some of these ""summary sheets"" included in your courses as part of the supporting material.Thanks a lot.",4
93099,It is not entry course! Please be well prepared!,3
93100,"The lectures are very informative and the exams are challenging, at least for a beginner like me.",4
93101,Amazing course. Lots of new tricks learned. The assignments were challenging and a lot of fun.,5
93102,The course is very helpful for me.,5
93103,I have taken R classes in grad school. I can honestly say that I have throughly learned R from this course. I like the approach and the background foundation that they setup to learn the rest of the language.,5
93104,Excellent start to programming with R,5
93105,I think that the course may have gone a little fast in some topics like applying lapply before we learn about it,5
93106,"Good course in general. Gives a introduction to R and its basic function and structures. I recommend this courses to the ones who start using R as an analytical tool and have some basic experience with programming or data analyses. Maybe some improvement would be nice: For example, some of the assignments weren't fully consistent with coursework. However, overall a great introduction to R programming.",4
93107,"This courses is a great course to start learning and mastering R. One drawbacks, there are so many open source that contain the solutions to the assignments and people who want a certificate can easily get it without understand everything. But if you think a while, what can they do with that certificate?",5
93108,"I've learned much about R Programming, and feel I have a solid base and am now far more comfortable to explore more within this application.",5
93109,Great course for a beginner,5
93110,Not enough support!I,1
93111,Challenging and worth my time. It validated my understanding of the subject.,5
93112,Training material and assignment levels don't match up. better training material and videos expected.,3
93113,"Very, and the best R programming course I've seen online as of yet.A must for anyone who wish to learn R Programming, and advance in Data Science",5
93114,Solid introduction to R,4
93115,Great introduction to R. Maybe not for beginers.I have learned a lot. Esasy sort videos with just the necesary things to advance in r programming.,5
93116,This course really helped me understand the fundamental basics of R programming with really cool explanation and exercises.,5
93117,Excellent course. Especially for students like me who does not have any IT background. R is tremendously powerful software and this course helped me a lot to gain knowledge in R.,5
93118,I'm really learning R with this course but it's a pity in the last quiz of week 4 the code asked to type in in the last 3 questions didn't work. However it was easy to work out what the question was trying to ask.,4
93119,GOOD Course. Little tough for beginners. Datacamp.com basics is easy and understandable than coursera. I have learnt a lot from this course. Worth it,5
93120,I really enjoyed this course.The challenging exams helped me learn how to use R to read and explore Data.,5
93121,A little difficult and fast but you do get to learn a lot. The plus point is that Coursera provides ample of time to get through with this course which really worked for me since and I'm working and studying both.,4
93122,"I understand why R was chosen to be the statistical software package chosen here, but I personally don't like it and professionally use SAS JMP.",3
93123,"Very good introduction to R, and its use of data structures, indexing, logical arguments, lexical scoping etc. The problems at the end really ensure you come away from this course with sufficient knowledge. Would recommend.",5
93124,Very instructive,5
93125,"The assignements are excellent for learning. however, the last assignment for programming might be too difficult for total beginners. need to put in extra effort.",4
93126,"Tough, but great, I made it",5
93127,"Some of the material was not useful in completing the assignments. Profiling was not useful in this regard. While it is useful in the real world, it was unrelated to the assignments. Also, Better examples of functions like lapply, tapply etc. besides using random data would be more likely to make sense what the function is doing. Also, there are references to statistics/statistical methods that the student may have no background in. This is also not helpful for explaining the material. The video content is largely just reading the text of the slides. It takes much more time to watch the reading of the slides than just to read them. This is not the best use of video. Neither is watching the instructor sitting in his office talking. It would be better to see a concrete problem solved, and explain why the steps taken are used. The problem could be related to the assignments but different enough to not be copied. I had to rely heavily on online resources and help files to get answers to things I think should have been part of the course material, as this is an introductory class.",3
93128,"It is helpful course that offer me basic understanding about R programming. Plus, the lecture also provides a lot useful material to read after class.",5
93129,"A very good class!. However, the course is somehow shallow. More professional skills should be introduced.",5
93130,It is not a beginner friendly course. Learn R from somewhere else and then take this course.,3
93131,Very inspiring!This course enables me to deal with R programming by myself!,5
93132,A very challenging educational experience.,5
93133,Excellent course for beginners of students aspiring data analytics as a career. It teaches us the fundamentals of R programming language with utmost clarity and challenging assignments. The discussion forums were very much helpful. Everything goes smooth if we complete the course within the stipulated time. I had a wonderful experience completing my first course in Data Science and also in Coursera. I'm looking forward to complete more courses and strengthen my career.,5
93134,thanks,5
93135,It was a wonderful experience and really exiting working through the extracting and manipulating of data from files and data frames.This course had been a wonderful guide to words this amazing Data science technique.But i would appreciate if you could leave learners with plenty of real problem questions to deal with after the completion of this course.Thank You!,5
93136,"While challenging, this course did more than simply lay out the basics of R. It moved me to think critically about specific tasks and innovate ways of solving problems using the language.",5
93137,"I am a very frustrated learner trying to write a constructive review here. I studied the course full time to get a certificate to put in my profile. R programming is considered nearly essential skill, if not fundamental, to data analysis. So I had high hopes going into this course.Lecture videos: I cannot begin to tell you how many times I fell asleep watching the video lectures. This course is for you if you like listening to someone talking through pages and pages of copy/paste text from a command prompt. I, on the other hand, prefer learning by doing. Sadly, all the doing is clumped into the assignments (more on them later). Also, Dr. Peng makes gross burping/drooling noises in the video from time to time. I apologize if that sounded rude, but try listening to the lectures with headphones and you'll say the same. Video editing for pre-recorded videos is not rocket science.Assignments: These were the biggest frustration throughout the course. Imagine you want to learn to play the piano (and you play a little guitar now) and you go to the piano class. Your piano teacher talks your ears off with music theory for several hours and then hangs you out to dry in front of an audience in a concert hall. You protest ""But I have no clue of how to PLAY"", but your teacher says ""All the piano greats learned by fiddling around with a ""hacker"" mentality"". You ask ""Why did I pay $50 to hack on my own?""Off-lecture help: If you take the course for the same reason I did, then thank your favorite god for the moderators in the discussion forums (mentors). 1 out of the 2 stars I give belongs solely to them and the fantastic work they do. The stickied posts in the forums offer a bit of help with the assignments (not enough, but still something). And they are also active in answering questions. The other star in my review goes to ""Swirl"". You will learn way more by doing the swirl exercises than watching the lectures by a long way.In conclusion, I finished the course with nothing more than a rudimentary understanding of R despite the fine grades. Very little thought seems to have been put into the lectures. I would recommend this only if you want to show this certificate to someone. Otherwise, stay away!",2
93138,"I learned from the lectures, but the lectures didn't prepare me to do the hmwk.",3
93139,Not as easy as I had expected but certainly worth every minute spent on it. Definitely recommend it.,5
93140,Great class! I know way more about R than I did 4 weeks ago!,5
93141,"Very painful training, the contents reviewed in the material will not make you capable to solve the weekly assignments, you will have to learn what you need on your own. To me the only value added of this course is that I will receive a proof that I know how to define basic functions in R.",1
93142,Thank you!,5
93143,"great overview, but pretty challenging for those without any programming experience.",4
93144,in conjunction with swirl this is a comprehensive starter kit for R. I already have some tools I can use in work (when they let me have it!),5
93145,The data used for assignments are real world examples which makes the programming interesting. It would be helpful if the course provides sources for some other databases,5
93146,"R is a good to know tool, but so many of these process are automated now. You can do this quite easily in XLS or SPSS in most cases.",2
93147,"Great course! The assignments are quite challenging but don't worry, you get plenty of guidance from the discussion forums. All in all worthwhile.",5
93148,Interesting Course. really enjoyed the swirl practice assignments. Final assignment is quite difficult,4
93149,Great Introduction to R!,5
93150,Best course to start Coding with R and learn R.,5
93151,Very good course for beginners.,5
93152,It seemed like course material had little to do with the assignments. Teach us how to read alphabets and assignment is to write poetry. Big jump!,3
93153,Good number of practice exercises and explanations. Thank you very much.,5
93154,Wide course on R and perfect introduction to its world. Need quite a bit of effort for non programers,4
93155,"This course is ""1-dimensional"" and not of high didactic quality. I have followed several other courses ( also Python in Coursera set up) and this one really disappointed me ( I'm in wk 2 out of 4 now). It is a bit of a pitty that the instructor speaks too rapid ( it is ment to be also for non-native US speakers?). The material is hardly explained step by step. So what I do at the moment: I watch the video and than go to Yuotube to find other videos that deal with the topics in an easier and didactic better way.Examples of good cousres in my opinion are stats and probabilty course/ and the python coursePS ""all of the data toolbox"" course seem to have the same flaws.Of course my knowledge level is low concerning programming ( I am a MD, so hardly scientific educated...). Nevertheless I hope this feedback can be of any good.",2
93156,Very good for beginners!,5
93157,"Great course. Challenging and requires some independent problem solving, but from my experience, that's the way it should be. Fun and interesting as well!",4
93158,Course material is very good for people like me who are completely new to R.,5
93159,The course gives all basic knowleges to start programming with R.,5
93160,"Pros:- If you don't know R well, or at all, you will learn a lot about R!- The projects were sufficiently challenging and used real data. Great experience.Cons:- Some knowledge required in the assignments are not covered at all in the lectures, or even the textbook.- The week 2 assignment was a bit less clear than it could've been.Other thoughts: I wouldn't recommend this course for someone new to programming. You should have at least SOME programming experience. Even for someone with some coding experience it can be quite challenging. But that's what makes it so FUN!",4
93161,Great introduction to R. Force the student to change the way of thinking data analysis.,5
93162,Best course for beginners,5
93163,Great job...projects were too hard..need more instructions on coding,4
93164,Very solid and useful course! I have learned the coding skills and never imagined several lines in R can be so powerful.,5
93165,"课程比较多的讲述了R的基础知识，这是什么不会搜什么的学习方式所不能带来的。希望课程能增加一些更有趣的作业。同时，短时间内接触大量基础知识容易感到枯燥并且难以牢记，建议每一个视频后面增加短短的几个编程的习题，这样可以更快地掌握。The course is more about the basic knowledge of R, which is good considering that looking for the answer when meeting with problems cannot teach this. Hope that more interesting assignments could be added. Finally, too much basic knowledge makes people boring, it would be better if after each video the students could do some short programming tasks.",4
93166,"Chalenging exercices (I think a little too much), excelent readings, excelent presentation of R language.",4
93167,"Good One , but quiz 3 is not accepting right answers",4
93168,"materials didn't cover everything necessary for assignments, and time requirement was not clear",3
93169,"I learned so much in this course (especially considering the amount of time I put into it). I was really impressed with the quality and content of the course (SWIRL exercises, videos, and the week 4 programming assignment all went a long way toward growing my skills as a data scientist).",5
93170,"It is easy to follow, it should be a 2 week university course, but IMHO it should cover more about the data type problems that can arise with R loose data types. It is focusing too much on the code profile concept without leaving interesting knowledge about that. It should cover better the native idea/implementation about computation as single instruction multiple data, which is not well covered. In the end, this is one interesting aspect of the language that makes it useful for data science.",3
93171,"Great practical exercises and content, I learned a ton! Really having fun with the classes.",5
93172,"It was a great course with great practice exercises, which helped me a lot to understand all the concepts as well as implemented them in an efficient manner.",5
93173,Awesome Course,5
93174,"Excellent introduction to R Programming...whether you are taking it stand-alone, as part of the data scientist specialization or want to ease into the machine learning side of things . The swirl() exercises are a helpful add. Kudos to the team.",5
93175,Excellent course set with good exercise.,5
93176,Good to learn fundamentals of R,4
93177,"Assumes no prior knowledge, definitely helps if you do, but the course teaches you from scratch, at a quick pace. The videos do have links where you can find more reading material, when needed, although highly recommended. Best money I could have invested.",5
93178,"although it gives an introduction to R, however the structure of the course overall was not up to expectation or objectives of it.the videos were very much theoretical and boring. Introducing too many concepts (although basic) was not related to the programming assignments. I had to google almost all assignments. It's arguable that this is one way of learning and more of realistic. But on the contrary, as I'm paying to get the knowledge I shouldn't be wandering around to understand something that should've been taught in the lectures.Moreover, I think that the videos need to be updated, the mentors need to be more involved in the forums, and the way the slides are presented within the videos should be more interactive or dynamic rather than being just captured lines of codes.",3
93179,This program is well structured and provides lots of examples with detailed steps to learning the course material. The swirl assignments were very helpful in getting you oriented and giving you a broader understanding to the progeam.I will encourage everyone who want to take this course to do so. There is a lot of help provided again on the discussion platform.,5
93180,Good explanation and easy to follow.,4
93181,Assignments are not good representations of course materials. The Instructor speaks too fast.,3
93182,The course offers good insight into R programming for beginners. A little more application and examples would make the course even better.,4
93183,"Simple to understand, lead you through the basics concepts of R programming language. The examples are clear and easy to follow.",5
93184,"its very good course and I seriously inspired the way it teaches me, first time I opened R programming and now I am little more comfortable, hope and wish I will continue my zeal toward data science, thanks for the course",5
93185,I really liked the assignments,5
93186,Excellent and well organized! Thanks!,5
93187,Few more examples would be much better..,4
93188,There is a disconnect between the video lectures and the assignments/quizzes.,1
93189,"I enjoyed doing this R programming course , my sincere thanks to coursera for this online course.Thank you all",5
93190,"This course is very help full, interactive and well designed.",5
93191,overall pretty solid. would love a bit more feedback and/or greater correlation between material and assignments. But overall nice introduction to R.,4
93192,"I would say 3-4 stars. Week 3 was kind of dense really. The assignment was also a little over my head not due to the complexity but certain aspects were not covered in length. Week 4 was good though, and it was enjoyable. Overall a really nice introduction to R and I would certainly recommend this course to my friends.",4
93193,"It was a great experience taking this online course. Love the swirl() learning package. The course difficulty level is appropriate for me. Worked hard, practiced a lot, and finally got all the credits and the certificate.",4
93194,"The course was a rapid cursory introduction to R. This being said, I recommend breaking the course into multiple separate courses and including more depth (with further practice) to guarantee that the student has truly achieved mastery. I supplemented the course with courses from DataCamp and Udemy, and only now (after completing the course here on Coursera, reading the textbook(s), and additional practice through the online training by Udemy and DataCamp) can I say that I am gaining true proficiency in R.This being said, the course was very well organized, had great examples, and excellent lectures (although the audio could be clarified by quite a bit using a higher-end microphone, preamp, interface, and affordable audio production software such as Reaper to clarify the voice).",4
93195,programming part would have been better with slightly more guidance,4
93196,Jump Starting R programming. Best one,5
93197,An order of magnitude more difficult than the intro course. Unexpectedly tricky at times ( esp. if you're primarily versed in programming & not stats ) but more all the more worth it for the difficulty spike.,4
93198,"This course is really not easy to who is not in the domain of computer science. Even the computer science people, it's also not quite easy to familiar with that statistic program, e.g. R Programming. If having more ""trace program"" training, I'd be better for that students who I mention above.However, anyway, I very much enjoyed this course to know how to program to analysis a data set.Thank you very much.",4
93199,"Decent class with good programming assignments. I wish there had been more examples of actually writing code in the lectures, but that is my only complaint.",4
93200,Great introduction to the R language !,5
93201,nice way of teaching.,5
93202,Very well built.,5
93203,should provide some live examples with every thing we study,4
93204,Great Course to learn how to be familiar with R.,5
93205,Awesome lectures.... Learned a lot about the basics,5
93206,Very informative and useful course on R programming for beginners like me.,5
93207,"Really helpful, but the quiz is a little difficult. I think class would better be extend to 5 weeks.",5
93208,This is a very good introduction to R. The material is good and this works well as a introduction to R if you have either high interest or some programming experience.,5
93209,A great course that needs a little reorganization.,4
93210,Thank you for the great possibility to learn R :-),5
93211,Very well designed course,5
93212,"Good course, learn a lot of R and statistics",5
93213,"Its such an awesome course but need a lot of practice apart from the practice exercises. If we don't make a note of the concepts or didn't practice we cant memorize anything. Jeff Leek, he is such a great professor. I think he is the best when it comes to explaining something. I am doing Data Science Specialization.",5
93214,"This is a good overview to R Programming, though the lectures leave much to be desired, at least for a programming beginner. Watching the videos left me confused about key concepts, which I absorbed much better through the Swirl interactive exercises, the discussion forums and other examples online. Of course we are supposed to be ""hackers,"" but I enjoyed this course much more once I just turned off the video, read through the slides and focused on other areas where I could learn the concepts.Also, the discussion forums were great for helping with key issues, and the homework assignments were also outstanding for making sure you absorb and apply concepts. So it's worth taking - just keep in mind the videos may not be for everyone...",4
93215,I don't think the course is setup for a beginner or a person who has never used R...very frustrated with needing to search the internet for help on everything that the course is supposed to be teaching me.,2
93216,Very informative and unique.,5
93217,"I learned a lot fast in the class - but the assignments seemed very difficult, and often didn't match the content of the lectures. I enjoyed the class, and definitely earned all I learned.",4
93218,Thanks,5
93219,A lot of programing!!,4
93220,Well presented. Especially the introductory stages.,5
93221,This is a great course to get a hands-on-introduction to R programming and basics!,5
93222,Not easy for new learners,4
93223,Quite a good course. I enjoyed working with swirl.,5
93224,I really enjoy it although it is tough for a begginer specially the assigments but there is help in the internet and the forum so it is fun and good to learn thanks lot,5
93225,The assignments had nothing to do with the lectures. The teachers do a poor job of explaining basic concepts and theories. The class is a lot more advanced than the class description makes it seem.,1
93226,coursera的盈利项目，必须交钱才能take quiz and assignment。不过swirl还是很不错的。,4
93227,Very interesting data sets that keep you engaged and wanting to learn more R!,5
93228,Needs clear instructions,3
93229,I liked the course very much because Mr Peng has given me very good grounding of the basics of R. I wish to keep learning more about R because this course has certainly motivated me enough to pursue the next course on R. Thanks team for having me as a participant. All the best to Mr Peng :-),5
93230,The prof speaks VERY FAST.,4
93231,"Well-organized R programming course for academic amateur with some OOP knowledge before! By simply using Rgui, th is class focuses on techniques in ABC's of R programming including not limited to basci objects, data strcuture, controlling sentences, I/O and debugging suggestions.Personally, I take this course for job purpose, but this course falls short for industrial techniques, such as reading/outputting excel, sophiticated operation on data frame, or combining R with Python and SQL.Hope that this comment will be useful to you.",5
93232,not the easier way to learn R,3
93233,A crash course in R.,5
93234,As someone who did not have a programming background I found this course very challenging but,5
93235,"I will break down the review into the contents and comment on them. Before doing that and saving the trouble for people who do not like to read a lot - This course is an awesome kick-starter for R-programming.Video Lectures : The speed and content are just perfect. The concepts covered in each lecture and the manner in which it was taught just made them stick well in my mind.2. Quiz - They were simple so I infer that they are meant to test how well we have learnt the concepts.3. Swirl Practice Programming Assignments - A very innovative way to teach us in the R console itself. I really enjoyed playing with it.4. Programming Assignment - It was a sheer pleasure to do the last assignment. The level was really good. I found it a bit daunting at first but then caught up by reviewing some concepts.5. Discussion Forums - I couldn't be very active in terms of replying but I never missed to hear what mentors had to say. I owe thanks to mentors for their awesome posts that gave deeper insights especially Al Warren.I highly recommend this course. Prof. Peng - your videos are really good and far from boring. And yes, Thank you Coursera.",5
93236,Good Intro to R.Basics of ggplot2 should have been covered along with base graphs or as a separate unit,5
93237,This was a challenging class and it took me quite some time to figure things out. But I feel I learned something. Definitely check the tips provided my the mentors in the forums,5
93238,Very informative and a good learning process. Assignments help in thorough understanding.,5
93239,"From my past experience, I know it’s not easy for people to take suggestions. But I still want to have a try this time.I had high hopes for this course, but I am quite disappointed. I think Dr. Peng needs to improve his teaching skills.1. Good teaching is clear, concise, and right to the point. So please slow down, speak. Don’t mumble.2. Programming is a practical skill. So the best method to learn programming is to use step-by-step demos. You can talk about a concept for 5 to 10 minutes but I still can’t get it. Use a demo and I can get it right away.3. Don’t just try to cover the materials so you think you have done the teaching, try to understand how your students learn and make sure they really get it.4. If you haven’t covered some concept, don’t assume your students will understand it by magic.A good teacher can make the learning experience effortless and fun, a poor teacher makes it like a torture.",2
93240,"The material is excellent for some one who want to study coding in R. However, the course could be very difficult if you have no experience in programming in other language. I suggest that the team should clarify that programming experience are needed to take this course.",5
93241,This was actually pretty hard. I felt like the questions asked in the quiz were considerable above and beyond what was taught - and the amount of R itself taught felt like being thrown in the deep end.,3
93242,There are huge gaps between learning materials (videos) and assignments. Assignments are very difficult and definitely not for R beginners. Also assignments' instruction are a little difficult to understand. I wonder if the purpose of assignments is to exam our reading and understanding abilities or the skills of R!!!I also took courses <Getting and Cleaning Data> and <Exploratory Data Analysis> at the same time and these two courses' assignments are much easier than the course <R Programming>. Writing function in R really isn't that easy especially for an R beginner who only has little knowledge of R packages and functions. I really don't think this course should arrange as the second course to take in this Data Science course series.,2
93243,Learning have never been this easy for me . Thank you so much my mentors .,5
93244,"It's very interesting course, what give you a basics of R programming language. The most interesting was the last programming assignment with real data set.",5
93245,"Even though its a starting course in the specialization, i wish it could have been more difficult.",5
93246,"A University Course should be a place where you advance your knowledge with a ""limited and reasonable"" amount of time spent in the course. The role of instructors should be to ""invest"" the time to provide the concepts and information for the students of the course to ""learn"" faster than if they had to research (the planet) by themselves to find the knowledge. The information provided by instructors therefore must be ""accurate and complete"". This course has so many ""incomplete"" pieces of information, that it requires insurmountable amounts of time to ""find"" the concepts required to apply the knowledge, hence it becomes a gigantic ""time waster"". Unfortunate! the tool and the concept of data science is necessary, but a course organized this way is only for ""full time students"" that have only one obligation, study. This course as it is should not be in Coursera.",1
93247,Nice study for starting in field of Data Science,4
93248,"really good course, but i really prefer more demos in the course, instead of simply presenting codes in the board.",5
93249,A real challenge for a novice but rewarding in the end.,5
93250,"Better than the Data Scientist's toolbox, but not a great introduction to R. When I'm learning a new language, I don't want to know about data types and for loops. A detailed example showing the strengths of this language would be better.",2
93251,The course content and the assignments are too far apart. I would have learned more if it was better aligned and there were some exercise in between.,2
93252,Somewhere during the second week there is a gap in coding that I could not overcome and this ruined the whole interest in pursuing the course because in order to overcome it I had to cheat. I don't feel like I am learning anymore.,1
93253,Challenging course but definitely worth it. It makeThe swirl exercises are a great help.,5
93254,It's very cool.,5
93255,It's wonderful!,5
93256,Very Helpful for a Novoice,5
93257,Great course for starters who are willing to pursue their career in R programming or Data Analysis,5
93258,Good starting course,5
93259,Difficult but worth it. You really learn to code in R and tools to apply in your job.,5
93260,Gave me the intro I needed to R in bite sized chunks,5
93261,"The course is very well laid out to demonstrate the main features of R programming language. (To elaborate on one thing that I liked) The programming assignment for the 4th week (rating/choosing hospital based on outcome) is very helpful to try out what I learnt from the course so far. All the 3 parts of this question are connected well, and I hope the rest of the courses of the Data Specialization is also implementing similar format.",4
93262,Really good course but it should be a little more interactive.,4
93263,"Overall a good crash course and introduction to R. Its a lot to learn in 4 weeks and some of the assignments were challenging (which I liked). I think the course is worth taking but I do wish the material and assignments were packaged better - more aligned. Just be prepared to spend a lot of time online reading, researching, and learning some concepts on your own. Don't expect to learn everything from the lectures and materials to be successful in this course.",3
93264,"Challenging,not easy to do.Especially the homework.",5
93265,The lectures for this course do not adequately prepare students for the graded quizzes and assignments.,2
93266,homework was poorly structured and not adequately discussed in the lecture videos. Had to dig through several buried links to make any progress on the homework assignments.,1
93267,The videos have very little to do with tests,1
93268,Thank you for this amazing course! it's a great complement for data science!,5
93269,Personally very fulfilling. Learnt all the basic stuff I needed to know.,4
93270,It‘s gooood for us primary learners.,5
93271,A little bit too muchMaybe five week is better,4
93272,Great course! Covers almost all the R concepts.,5
93273,"Great course for beginners! Informative, well-structured and straightforward. The ""SWIRL"" exercises and the introduction to GitHub are also very useful.",5
93274,There is a disconnect between what is taught and what is assigned.,2
93275,Pretty short introduction to R.,3
93276,Very useful material and easy to follow up,5
93277,Great way to ramp up on R.,4
93278,"So the course is a mixed bag.PROS: The lecture content is useful, albeit a bit dry. I can't give them too much slack for the dryness, after all it's coding. However, they could have shown more real-time coding, rather than just scrolled through powerpoints with the Command Window pasted. You definitely need to have R open when following along with the lectures. The quizzes are also quite useful, as you're required to know both the background of how things work and use the commands learned from the lecture.CONS: The assignments assume you know a lot more than the basic knowledge, and there's no real way to know how to do the assignments just from the lectures. The quizzes tend to be on the easy side and the assignments ramp things up quite quickly. There's no intermediate material to test your skill. You have to have worked in R to have even a minor chance at succeeding on the assignments.",3
93279,Learned a lot about R,5
93280,Very good 2 day crash course on R programming basics,5
93281,well explained with examples,5
93282,I am learning a lot through the assignments! make it more difficult next time so that people start exploring a lot,5
93283,"Fantastic overview, definitely enough to get me started :)",5
93284,"This course is not set up right, the assignments ask you to do things that aren't explained until the next weeks content, its kind of discouraging. In the end, it does teach you the basics of R, its just too bad that the way to get there is aggravating.The reason I still only give it 2 stars is because of the quality of the courses itself. There are many, many 1 and 2 minute videos, these could've easily been combined. The teacher seems unprepared in his lectures, he stutters and repeats a lot and makes a weird noise between slides. This shouldn't be necessary with pre-recorded lectures. The assignments and quizzes are also poorly written and contain spelling and sloppy mistakes, which doesn't make sense because the material isn't new. It all just makes it seem like the teacher doesn't really care and just wants to sell the course to a lot of people without putting in much effort.If you are not following the specialization I would not advise this course for beginners. I'm quite surprised to see the course get such high ratings.",2
93285,"A comprehensive introduction to programming in R, for people already experienced with numerical software like MATLAB and Mathematica it should be fairly easy to grasp some of the concepts of the language.The assignments are not difficult, though it requires the student to lookup for information in R forums, or stackoverflow.Finally, Roger is a great instructor in my opinion - he's very calm and explains some difficult aspects of the language in a clear way.",5
93286,It would be nice if you could combine the lecture notes into a single file for download.,4
93287,Great !,5
93288,"The course is properly designed for people new to R programming, assignments are bit time consuming.Overall i am happy with what i have learnt.",5
93289,This course is awesome. It gets you the skills you need to do data analysis in faster and smarter ways,5
93290,"I will recommend it 100% for those who want to learn R. There are good teachers, explanations, assignments... But it may have some tricky exercises for those who have not programmed before.",5
93291,"Difficult at times, I regularly used outside websites like stackoverflow to help with assignments, but that's how the real world works, there's no way that the lectures could solve all your problems.Favorite: writing my own functions that searched real databases and returned means, ranks, and useful info. I felt like I took a huge step forward in my goal for data science.Least favorite: Assignment #2, it felt completely unrelated to anything I learned, I wasted hours just to find out it was redundantly simple and in the end I didn't even find out if my code worked, the grade was peer-reviewed based on if you could correctly upload it to github and if it ""looked"" like it would work. (How would I know! LOL, I assumed all my peers' code was good enough)Would 100% take this course again.",5
93292,it's so hard for beginners in my opinion,2
93293,"Clear, descriptive and Knowledgeable courser on R. Thanks for this.",5
93294,It begins from the very basics of R and has a good and comprehensive order to the most advanced functions.,5
93295,"the presentations are very hard to follow, it requires a lot of extra time reading the professor's book",3
93296,"This course is very thorough, but I did not feel that the lessons often prepared me for the programming assignments. I found that I was frequently looking on the internet for additional resources and finding that I was definitely not alone.",3
93297,"This course was frustrating, the learning curve nearly vertical, the material dense and inaccessible, and the evaluative assignments impossible for new users of R without outside resources. No one should take this course unless they are powering through it for the Data Science specialization. Otherwise, would-be students should just buy an R For Dummies book, and use materials elsewhere.",1
93298,"This is an awesome course! Prof. Peng explains very well how to become proficient in R programming. Even if you have no prior experience in the subject, just like me, hard work and discipline will pay off.",5
93299,"Very good introductory curse of R language, teaches you everything you need to start your own projects, shows you resources to start learning on your own.",4
93300,They shouldn't compact 14+ videos in one week.,1
93301,"I'm not saying R Programming has to be a gripping subject, but this course is pretty dull. The value of good teaching methods is often underrated in transferring knowledge.",3
93302,This course is perfectly suitable for beginners like me. It gives a very clear and systematic introduction and basic rules of R.,5
93303,"This course was a good experience, but I wish there were more explained tasks of difficult functions and loops before giving difficult exercises. Also I find this course a little bit boring for me and sometimes very difficult (especially in peer graided assignment)",4
93304,"It's ok that the instructor always talks fast, but he stammered a lot. Wish he could speak everything fluently.",3
93305,Good course for biginner,5
93306,"A great course to advance programming skills in R. Assignments are sometimes challenging, but that´s also what makes it interesting and even more fun if you mastered the challenges and reached your goal. I highly recommend it!",5
93307,Very well elaborated. Swirl is an amazing way to teach (even though is somewhat easy). Great resources.The tests could have been harder though.,4
93308,"Yes, this is not for beginners.The assignment since week2 is beyond what was taught in class. I have to pay another 25 dollars on datacamp and finish 10+ courses, spending 2 weeks at least. Go back to the assignment, without success. The learning curve is a bit tough. Anyway, I'm kind of newbie on programming, will continue learning this one.",4
93309,Kind of difficult,4
93310,Learned a lot.,5
93311,this course is very helpful for those who are new to R language,5
93312,"Need way more content, and accesibility to begginers, gap between theory and practical exercises is too big!",3
93313,good introduction to R!!,4
93314,Very enriching course. Steep learning curve for beginner in the assignments.,4
93315,This course is quite hard if you don't have some programming basics. Otherwise it is very fulfilling.,4
93316,Great R starter!,5
93317,Great course.,5
93318,Very good course.I would recommend others to go through this course.,4
93319,"Quite difficult, and you certainly need to work hard to figure out the exercises. The lectures get you started but don't have all the answers. Not one for people who want to be spoonfed.",5
93320,very good introductory course. It was very fun and challenging overall. Especially for the last exercise,5
93321,"Excellent introduction to R. It helps to have prior experience with programming, I believe.",5
93322,Assignments are not what we expected to be according to video lectures...,4
93323,A stimulating introduction to R. I appreciate the variety of ways in which information is conveyed.,5
93324,Nice introduction to R,5
93325,Need more excercises,4
93326,Relly liked this course. It gives the basics of R- commands that you need to evolve your skills to a higher level. Fun!,5
93327,"Quiz and especially assignments were poorly written. Spelling mistakes in slides is simply unacceptable in high-level academia, in my opinion. Especially for a course designed for a global audience.",3
93328,The swirl exercises are truly informative.,5
93329,"Great course, with a very well build education track.",5
93330,It let me learn a lot!,5
93331,"Amazing one. I learnt a lot from this course, especially from the assignments.",5
93332,"I only finished week one so far. My opinion (to the first week's content) is that it's a little bit hard to familiarize all those basic R concepts from scratch. Maybe the teaching staff would want to make it more concise so that before any real application (or simulation), students do not get lost in those technicalities. However, it's pretty great course. It's pretty detailed and informative.",4
93333,Very useful and easy to understand.,5
93334,"Rather boring, but very useful.",5
93335,Excellent and challenging introduction to programming in R. Plenty of materials to help you along the way and the course is delivered at a reasonable pace in a friendly and clear manner. Would highly recommend if you want to get into programming in R.,5
93336,I loved it!,5
93337,Great class,5
93338,"The first 2 weeks have too many videos, which make it difficult to follow. This breaks the flow of the lectures and makes a lot of unuseful repetitions.The slides only have words and are hard to follow, no graphs or illustrations, this means that you rely on the voice of the lecturer to guide you, which is difficult sometimes.Furthermore, the code presented is not run 'live', and results are often lacking, which makes comparison with 'my own results' hard to do.Summary: Not that its a bad course (SWIRL is a great tool), just look for another course that's easier to follow.",2
93339,A good first course for beginners,5
93340,"A great way to learn a new language is through use, using Swirl to teach the language R and at the same time concepts in data science was such an efficient and effect approach. Thank you",5
93341,It's a good preparation for a PhD prospective applicant like me. The course is tough but VERY USEFUL and INTERESTING! Thanks all Professors!,5
93342,I think there is something not so important but occupys a large part of this class. Maybe you can rebalance the priority of this the contents in this class and replenish some introductions of more useful functions.,4
93343,Well taught. Materials were good. Lessons increased knowledge.,5
93344,Good introduction to R,4
93345,"I am reviewing at very early stage (after 1 week of my study in this course) but I am pleased with the entire flow, management etc of the course so far.SWIRL is I would say one of the best feature. Along with vid-lecs it gives us a perfect opportunity to get our grip on the programming.Wish we could have such facility with all such programming environments. :)Hats off to all the makers of the arrangements. Thanks a lot :)",5
93346,I highly recommend this course if you want to learn how to program in R. I'm new to programming and I found this course really helpful.,5
93347,"A very useful course that teaches techniques I could implement at work almost from day 1.Prof. Peng teaches the material in a very clear, well structured manner, and provides good real life examples.The course provides a suite of tools and techniques for data analysis that's a great starting point to build from.",5
93348,It gives you the basic idea of R coding. Swirl is very good. Homework 3 is a little bit tricky.Overall it's a good class.,4
93349,Loved the Coursework,5
93350,Excellent material and assignments for starters. Easy to follow for independent and self readers. Thanks,5
93351,"Excellent! Well tought, good ebook!",5
93352,"I really do not like the R language, I think it is sloppy and inconsistent. This class did ok teaching the basics of R, but it did not do anything toward teaching testing of R code (a key part of writing code!), best practices for modularization and factoring, and so on. In other words, it teaches you how to write R code that kind of works, but does not teach you how to write good code in R.",3
93353,Its good but found it a little theoretical.,3
93354,Great ! Nothing to add,5
93355,"I like the whole experience, but there are some gaps between sessions and weekly projects. I think this course can be improved with adding small tests between each session and providing several exercises as complimentary material. For understanding many topics I watch many other videos on youtube till I grasp the concept.",3
93356,Great way to get started with R.,5
93357,Great intro to R. Swirl programming studio is amazing and so easy to use,5
93358,"I was initially going to give this 3 stars but it would have been a biased score as I found the programming assignments too hard otherwise everything else was great, so I've added a star to counter my own bias.The programming assignments for a novice like me who has only completed the Data Scientist Toolbox course (which was the only prerequisite as far as I know but may have missed this in the opening spiel) would have significant difficulty completing and comprehensively understanding the programming assignments in any meaningful way (i.e. to reuse the knowledge in a different context or question).I completed all of the videos, swirl programming tasks, took fairly decent notes, exams/tests and still had to look elsewhere for much more guidance than I would have thought necessary on the programming assignments as I found them too hard to do on my own. I am not that smart though and this review can only capture part of my own subjective experience.Other than that, as I really enjoyed learning about R and analysing data in general as well as the way Robert Peng's teaching style and demeanour I really enjoyed it. Trying to work out if my failure to understand and reapply is a lack of my fully grasping the material and if so whether to continue grappling with R and programming in general. I've started the third course of the specialisation so will give you more feedback once I'm done there.Thanks very much for the course and keep up the good work.",4
93359,A great course! The swirl exercises are perfect to stud and the teacher has a perfect communication.,5
93360,"Loved it. Incredibly well structured course, especially compared to some others I've done on Coursera.",5
93361,"Good content , nice flow of information .",5
93362,"Overall it's good. And I think PPT may be much more helpful if there is a video of professor, and some animations.",4
93363,This is an exceptionally good course provided by coursera....Thanks a bunch !!!,5
93364,Best course for me till now.,5
93365,"Excellent course! I already knew a lot about R - but this class helped me solidify what I already knew, taught me lots of new tricks, and now I have a certificate that says I know `something' about R!",5
93366,Course is good.Every Data scientist aspirant should go for it.,5
93367,"It is a very hard class for anyone who has never programmed before, in order to complete the assignments you have to look for a lot of extra information.",4
93368,the swirl exercise along with the course makes much more sense,3
93369,I think this class is one of the most beneficial course in Coursera !!!Thanks alot !!,5
93370,"It was very difficult for me to follow the exercises, since I don't have a programming background.",3
93371,"Good exercises and challenging course, but very hard if you do not know any R beforehand.",4
93372,"This was a good class. The lectures were interesting. The swirl package was fun for the most part. And the message boards were actually informative and helpful.The actual programs we were required to write could be used for other things in business or health science, and therefore were practical.",4
93373,"Great 101 class on R, including general programing skills that will translate into any programming language.",5
93374,"This course was mostly self learning. It gave me a framework to go along but what is presented in lecture and assignments are completely different. The discussion board and mentors are really good resources and can provide pointers to move along. It is definitely not a class that can provide sufficient information to learn and build applications, but the individual's effort in passing the quizzes and the projects will. It is up to the student to figure out through stack overflow, youtube, and other search result to figure out how to complete these assignments. I believe the assignments given from this class are realistic to real-world situations.",3
93375,Perfect!,5
93376,"This course is a little too deep into programming and a little light on learning the basics of R. I would recommend splitting out the more advanced programming concepts in this course and offering them in a course near the end of the specialization.This course should be higher level and give the user a wider view of R. Currently this course seems to assume significant knowledge of R or programming in general, making it not a good early course in the specialization.",2
93377,"This course is not very ""beginner friendly""",2
93378,good exercises for beginners,5
93379,"This course tells me basic functions but if we want to learn it more specialised or proficient, it may let you down.",4
93380,It´s a good R course.,4
93381,Very useful :),5
93382,Great course to understand R logics,5
93383,Nice Course! Very useful and informative.,5
93384,very practical,5
93385,An awesome course... enjoyed a lot ...cheers!!!,5
93386,"Course does not do a good job actually explaining R or training you on how to properly use it. The lectures go over the material very fast and you do not get much out of them, and then the assignments throw complex problems that are very difficult. You spend most of your time Googling to learn it, and I find that I would have learned R better if I just did that to start without this course. Maybe if you aren't new to R and have a programming background, it may not be so bad, but if you are new to R and not an experienced programmer, this is not the class to take to learn it.",1
93387,"Very good introduction to R Programming. It would be especially good if at the end of the course there were some model answers, though I appreciate the problem of answers transgressing into the public domain!",4
93388,"Very useful and compact introduction to R. After completing this course, you can start working on your data analysis right away.",5
93389,in starting going good .hope for next slide i am not good in programming please make for easy for new student ..,5
93390,good for begineers....but needs some more projects to be explained,5
93391,"Was tough enough to give me the feel of solving real problems. Would have appreciated a little more explanation of the return types of the looping functions, all time was spent on the parameters and no time on what the data structure returned is. Online documentation is also weak on this point so some instruction would have been helpful.",5
93392,Very informative course!,5
93393,"tutorial contents suit the first timer very well, ofcourse i used the R-programming book for further reading but the contents in this course suited my speed and awareness.. was able to learn R very effectively, specially the swirl was very good experience.",5
93394,"Morely designed on slideshows, not effective.",2
93395,Good course to learn R who plan to or are into data science/statistical field.,4
93396,Great course. Covers all the basics of R programming.,5
93397,Very Explanatory,5
93398,"It's very nice ,but it's a pity that i didn't have so much time to learn it.",5
93399,Great and Excellent thoughts and course material.,5
93400,nice but not understood some topics,4
93401,good course. ..highly recommended...,5
93402,Course is really great. However for the absolute beginners it might be challenging as the assignments and videos assume basic knowledge of stats and programing,4
93403,Great course!,5
93404,"Hands-on with the videos should be given, instead of cumulative long assignments.",4
93405,Not easy. But nothing easy in academics changes who you are.,5
93406,I study java at the university and this course has helped me alot to learn R.,5
93407,"This course was difficult for me to grasp. The instructor (I believe) assumes that all participants have some background in programming, and since I do not, I have a very difficult time following the examples. I bought the entire series of classes, but need to retake this one after I read some more from other sources and have had a chance to digest what's here.",2
93408,"Excellent course, but the difficulty of the content can be increased",5
93409,"Very good ! help me a lot , so appreciate !",5
93410,There is not much of a relation between what the course gives (explains with the videos and with the SWIRL exercises) and the real exercices they ask to. Too difficult to follow by people new in the programming area.,2
93411,Very useful and practical.,5
93412,The course is very informative. I especially recommend the swril practice problems. Assignments serve well for learning the concepts.,5
93413,Professor needs to emphasize on basics before going advance.,1
93414,It is quite helpful to review some basic tricks in SWIRL ! thanks,5
93415,"I studied this course twice. I found it useful, especially for those who want to learn more about big data.",5
93416,I give this course 3 star not 5 star because the level of programming assignments are bit difficult as compared to level discussed in lecture videos. Although lecture videos are very informative but beneficial only for very basic level programming and to solve these programming assignments lots of learning is needed.,3
93417,"I entered this course with no coding experience, and I can definitely say I am disadvantaged because of it. The lectures are great explanations of the different commands in R, and the projects are a great playground of R's different capabilities, but the lectures and projects are too difficult to approach using just the lectures. That being said, this course's difficulty provides students like myself the opportunity to learn how to ask questions and seek resources for the programming.Overall, I do not enjoy this course - mainly because it is very difficult. However, the course is structured logically and provides (what I assume the majority of students) a comprehensive introduction to R.",4
93418,good subject. but it's a little bit too difficult for newbies.,5
93419,Great lectures and very well structured.,5
93420,"The quickest way to start using R. In my opinion, previous experience with programming logic is required. Highly recommended.",5
93421,Excellent course - the assignments help learn the nuances of R.,5
93422,Loved the assignments. Stick with the problem sets for some time! :),5
93423,"Poor quality. A disappointing experience.The lectures are very basic, thought for people that have no experience in programming. This might be ok, but the difficulty of assignments should follow; instead, they can be relatively hard; newbie programmers will probably have an extremely hard time solving them, considering that many of the problems they will encounter are not treated at all in the course.The course does not focus enough on what differentiates R from other languages: just a few videos on data types, *apply functions, and a tiny little bit of scoping (very unclear). All these areas should have been expanded, and the course should have had more arguments as well.Finally, the assignments are not enough and their grading system is quite poor: instead of submitting your code and testing it automatically, you should calculate some quantities by hand and select the results out of a few possibilities.All in all, I was disappointed with the course.",2
93424,"I felt that the programming assignments were not explained well enough, things like different syntax that wasn't explained and such. If the class required a lot of outside research not included in the class, they should mention that more clearly.",3
93425,Decent basic introduction to R language for those how haven't work with R or just need a quick refresher,4
93426,"I really struggled - coming from a zero programming background. I recommend tons of reading, practical exercises, swirl is a bit of a savior and so is stackoverflow. Even with all of that, I struggled to get my mind to think like a programmer and structure the thoughts into plans for the assignments and tests. I think there needs to be a course before this that teaches one what the first step of solving a programming-related problem; eg one that focuses on flow charts, breaking down the question, etc... It literally is like learning a new language : you need to keep reading and practicing and watching/listening to others do it until you start to get it.",3
93427,"R Programming has solid information and exercises on just that! However the videos and sections for each week are not very clearly structured. Sometimes the end assignment can take many times the number of hours the rest of the content in a week requires. I'd be careful about taking this course while working unless you can devote serious time to programming projects on your off days. That stated, the course is excellent otherwise.",4
93428,"If you are planning to learn R, then go and buy a book. This course is a complete scam. At least don't pay any money. The reasons;1.) They advertise that you need couple of hours of study per week. That's a lie, you have to study much more than that unless if you know a little R programming.2.) The quiz questions are totally unrelated from the lessons. They teach you the basic stuff but they expect you to accomplish intermediate quizzes.3.) The instructor has no idea how to teach. May be he is trying to prove something. I couldn't really understand his motives. If you really want to teach that's simple. You do couple of extra videos and teach whatever you are asking in quizzes, or tell us to read a certain material. He didn't do any of them which means he either doesn't know how to teach or this specialization is a complete scam.4.) And I don't really understand what coursera is doing by the way? What kind of a business model is this. I was planning to enroll many specializations but now I am not going to do it. So think about how much they are loosing. Where is the quality assurance. Just because one guy comes up to you and say that he teaches this and that do you believe them?MY ADVICE TO YOU: DON'T PAY ANYTHING FOR THIS SPECIALIZATION. AND FOR ANY OTHER COURSE READ THE BAD REVIEWS FIRST (WHICH WAS MY MISTAKE).",1
93429,I was exceptionally pleased with this class. The workload was about right to really get you thinking in R,5
93430,Course can be made more rigorous and exhaustive.,4
93431,Great Course,5
93432,really helpful,5
93433,"The combination of assignments and quiz were amazing, It did make me relook at things I though I was clear. Coding made it challenging and exciting",5
93434,Excellent course for beginners,5
93435,A very good introduction to R programming.,5
93436,"I'm giving this course one star because zero stars is not an option.I wish I had read course reviews prior to beginning. First assignment was tough... but do-able. Second assignment seems straight forward, but the template they ask that you follow contains small tricks which appear to be FAR BEYOND anything touched on in lectures.I'm actually going to fight for my money back, what a scam.",1
93437,"Videos are poorly narrated and are marginally effective: vocabulary + key concepts only. The ""swirl"" exercises are woefully inadequate to prepare students for the quizzes. Foundational tasks (i.e. establishing a valid connection to the sample data) are conspicuously absent from the guided exercises; leaving too many students to seek help from message boards and google. Lastly, the ""professors"" are completely unreachable: they may as well be dead. After 30 years in the IT industry, I found this course to be profoundly aggravating and a complete waste of my time - I have abandoned this course and bought a ""Teach Yourself"" book instead.",1
93438,"Way too much way too fast. Not sure how I would make it better, but I felt like I was learning from googling more than from the course.",2
93439,very fast course that can be difficukt for young progrmmers,3
93440,"There is a high disparity between lecture content and the knowledge required to complete the assignments. It would be great to have a complete walk through of each assignment, showing the different ways in which the same functionality can be created, after having submitted an assignment. This would really had helped me to better understand why something is done in a certain way and improved my understanding of how R works. Currently there is zero feedback on completed assignments, which does not aid learning.",3
93441,An excellent R course for the beginners.,5
93442,"This is an excellent course, however, you need to dedicate at least 3 hour a day to complete it in one week if you have experience in programming.",5
93443,"This is not a course for a beginner in programming. If you are interested in learning R, I would recommend going to DataCamp and starting there. The lecture videos were not engaging, and the jump from the lecture and quizzes to the programming assignments was quite significant (as others have pointed out). The lecturer for this course does have a pre-programming assignment on his GitHub repository to aid in the first programming assignment, but this was not easy to locate nor advertised well (had to scroll through discussion forums before I saw someone mention it). The swirl assignments were the only saving grace for a class that was otherwise not engaging or structured well. The class could stand to be restructured: for example, it would have been nice for the lectures to cover the str() function before our first programming assignment. Overall, this class does seem to be a good choice for a ""refresher"" course if you already have some experience coding in R, but be wary if you have little to no programming experience.",2
93444,"Nice course with good introduction, but needs more guidance on homeworks",5
93445,it is really great! I advice it to anyone who is going to learn R,4
93446,I learned a lot,5
93447,"Death by power point. If you can learn from essentially listening to a pod cast and reading unix type manual pages, then this course is for you! If you're like the rest of the population, then these lecture videos are useless. The only redeeming quality to this course has been the homework, but you can find them online or come up with them on your own.",1
93448,nice course for the beginners...,5
93449,"This was a decent introduction to R, but my main issue is that the Data Science specialization is so dependent upon the R language. This course really should be more focused around Python or be more flexible in general.",3
93450,Full of stuffa nd really teaches you,5
93451,Lectures are very boring and designed in a weird way. He is simply reading the book that he wrote and no real practice was ever done.,1
93452,"It feels like this course was abandoned by the instructors. The Programming Assignments are practically impossible to be done unless you have previous programming experience. Other than swirl, it would be very helpful if there were basic optional exercises for those who have never programmed before. I worked hard to be able to follow it, but if I knew how uninvolved the instructors were, I would have saved my money and spent it on a course with active involvement from those who developed it. Disappointing.",2
93453,Very useful！,4
93454,"Very good intro to R programming. Like the assignment project and swirl package to help on hands-on R programming exercise. Even I didn't pay for the specialization, I love the way assignment is organized and gives expected output/results to your code, so I get to know if my code is correct or not.",5
93455,"Too much ppt and theory, while little examples and real code",2
93456,very useful material,5
93457,"The jump from the lecture material to the assignments was way too much. In order to complete the assignments, one needs to spend lots of time learning things not covered in the course.",1
93458,"This is not an introduction to R programming... this is more in-depth than just introduction... in week 2 we're asked to compute and program to read multiple files at once with very specific functionalities!... this is not an introduction to R programming whatsoever... also it requires a lot of user reading from other sources i.e. google, stack overflow... etc... I don't recommend this to newbies",2
93459,Great introduction.I think the swirl tutorials are particularly helpful for learning R in R.,5
93460,Useful and well-organized. I have learned a lot,5
93461,I love the professor! Well organized and deep insight!,5
93462,its awesome R programming from the basics,5
93463,"This is way too esoteric. The content was delivered way too fast for me to keep up and process it. This needs to be taught with more frequent hands on examples. I'm also not sure why, if auditing, we can't submit and see how we're doing on the learning. I have no way to evaluate if I'm picking up the concepts or not, which is a struggle. Overall, I would not recommend this course for R beginners. I would look elsewhere.",1
93464,This course would be one of the plus point for the job I am looking for.,4
93465,This was a very necessary but boring class.,3
93466,Why should I waste my time listening to someone reading a book to me...,1
93467,It is a solid start to learn R.Very friendly for rookies.,5
93468,"Great course for learning the basics in a structured , concise way.A bit basic but a great course nonetheless.",4
93469,Had general knowledge on R Programming and techniques to run. It has nice links and is useful for future project as well.,5
93470,Just perfect,5
93471,"Extremely well-organized course, with concise and very useful lectures!",5
93472,This course was so convoluted and not practical that it made me lose complete interest in the specialization.,1
93473,Very much helpful to understand the basic about the R programming. Very well structured,4
93474,"For an introductory course with no prerequisites, the assignments should cover material that has been introduced in lectures. Non-introductory and advanced courses in R can require students to look outside of lectures for completing relatively complex problems.",1
93475,R Programming is seeming difficult more hour courses are required to be initiated for making this language better learn among scientific community.,3
93476,Good course to begin with.,4
93477,"This is course was pretty hard for someone like me without any background in computer programming. I had to take it twice to pass it. Luckily, there are many wonderful people in Coursera and in R who are always willing to lend a hand. Even if you pass all the basic requirements of the course i encourage you to do an exploration on your own. There are so many things to learn to make your job easy and to give inspiration to improve your performance in whatever field your in. It might feel like you're not learning at times or it's too difficult to continue, but once you get there, you'll realize how this wonderful new tool can help you with data analysis and presentation.",5
93478,"Course was good, but the material covered was at a fairly high level and done too quickly. This course could use some demos and since its a core foundation for the rest of the courses, maybe it should be a longer more in-depth program.",3
93479,i feel this courses needs to be split into two different streams. One for beginners and one for people who are more comfortable with coding and R. I think that the learning curve is too steep for a part time course.,3
93480,Strong intro to R,4
93481,"This course is *NOT* for beginners. I would not have asked my work to pay for the specialization if I knew it would take me 3 months to complete R Programming. I have a degree in economics, magna cum laude, so clearly I'm not dumb. Also, I have non-trivial experience with Stata. When I read that this would be a suitable introduction for anyone, I had no idea that what it would really take was a professional programmer (which I am lucky to have as a partner) to fill in the gaps.Extremely misleading.",2
93482,"Excellent course. Good videos, very nice programming exercises.Perfect for someone who wants to learn R for the first time.",5
93483,Prefer More Sample study during the course.,4
93484,"its fun and well taught but i was having a little trouble understanding how to go about some of the topics here, this course being my first ever programming class i have ever taken. all in all i enjoyed every bit of it and its something i see myself doing in the future. Two thumbs up!!",4
93485,This course is the worst course that I have taken so far. I am not happy with the course content and the way that the lecturer uses to teach this course. I really want to refund my money!,1
93486,"The course lecture was ok, Swirl was pretty good. The assignment was confusing and the instructions were not very clear.",3
93487,"Very thorough and appropriate level of difficulty. Less one star because week 1 is way too much to retain before you get to practice, and there's really no reason to lay it out that way.",4
93488,in this course is a good Idea teke the swirl() section,5
93489,This course is a very nice introduction to R.I would advise to complete the swirl assignments as they provide good practice to memorise the commands. Sometimes it feels like swirl use a lot of positive reenforcement to the point of getting the impression of being trained like a dog.Still I felt a great sense of accomplishment completing the course.,4
93490,Assignments were difficult but would have been easy had I first been exposed to the material in later courses. Not sure why the specialization is structured that way. I'll definitely revisit my code for these assignments.,4
93491,Audited only.,4
93492,A very good course for begineers. :),5
93493,"Very good structured course, also good for not native speaking people",5
93494,"This course is an excellent introduction to the R programming language. I enjoyed taking the course and look forward to applying what I have learned. The lectures are very well done and the assignments, especially those in swirl are excellent for applied learning.",5
93495,"The lecture is too general. Not a courser for beginners. But if your are not a beginner, you won't need this, so…",2
93496,Excellent introduction to R!,5
93497,straight and narrow.,3
93498,This course fully meets my expectations. It provides a concise starting point and even manages to introduce advanced concepts such as the 'apply' family. The final assignment is fully appropriate.,5
93499,It's quite useful for beginners,5
93500,Great content delivered at a solid pace.,4
93501,"it is very useful for me ,but the only shortage is the lack of chinese sub-title.Thanks!!!",5
93502,The lectures did not prepare for quizzes/assignments. Not a class for beginners.It would be better if he used R while lecturing instead of just talking through the whole lecture.I got more out of the swirl tutorials than I did the lectures.,2
93503,"great course, very detailed + llots of references for further study",5
93504,"It's okay, the explanations are mediocre as well as the assignments.",3
93505,Great class with good support examples!,5
93506,Nice course and interesting material but the other students evaluation is quite subjective.,4
93507,This class was really good. Coincidentally I was struggling with this type of code. The case is challenging but very well delivered. The material is great.,5
93508,Learned a lot from this course but for people without any programming background it might be quite intimidating.,4
93509,There is a large gap between the assignments and lectures.,4
93510,The professor expressed the concept really good and it is quite easy to understand.,4
93511,"It would be better if it was more interactive. The videos aren't very helpful for a beginner programmer, and the assignments are pretty challenging. I still feel like I learned something though, but mostly from swirl which is a pretty cool thing!",3
93512,"Very steep learning curve, especially in the beginning.",4
93513,"A great intro to the basics of R programming that is especially useful for those who have aren't very familiar with programming, or extremely out of practice (such as myself...).",5
93514,"Challenging, but rewarding. I have been using R for years, and this is by far the best course on R Programming that I have ever come across.",5
93515,"Not a class for the beginning programmer. The lectures do not line up with the assignments, and if you don't have programming experience, you could easily spend 10-20 hours/week figuring out how to finish the assignments.",1
93516,not the model of learning that is encouraging or sticks. hard for a student (even one who has a programming background) to sit through hours of slides explaining what the functions and definitions in the language do without a layer of use context upfront.The content jumps from specific examples to unrelated specific definitions without carrying a sense of integrating the new knowledge with any past knowledge in the course. the whole course seems disjointed.would have been much more effective as learning through examples and to be taught functions and definitions as they come up in problem solving.,1
93517,"Great course to start getting your hands into R. While the lectures are OK and the Swirl exercises are great, the course falls a bit short in building you up to tackling the weekly programming assignments. I had to spend a lot of time researching on my own to complete the assignments. I don't mind that, but I could do that on my own without paying for the course. I'm paying because I want to learn R quickly without spending hours researching what could have easily been described in the lectures. A lot of times, the course mentors in the discussion forums provided the best guidance. I would have liked each programming exercise to build upon the last one, so that at the end of the course I would have a great R product to review later. As it is, each programming assignment can stand on its own. When learning to programming in a new language, I prefer small, quick victories that build upon one another to accomplish a great task. This is the reason for not giving full 5-stars. Otherwise, Dr. Peng does a good job at providing material. And, be sure to check out his podcast, Not So Standard Deviations, to remind you that even people who have been in this field for years still find some areas challenging. It gives us R beginners some mental support.",4
93518,Good Content to learn programming language.,5
93519,"This is a tougher class than advertised. I essentially had to clear my entire week's plans to complete the first week's assignment, which was by far the toughest. There needs to be more testing on a variety of incoming skill sets. The lectures can also benefit from a recalibration, because the lecturer speaks way too fast for newbies and speaks fastest when explaining the most complex concepts. This makes it tough to learn.",2
93520,Only problem was the large gap between the assignments and lectures. Swirl exercises should not be optional as they are the most helpful part of the course.,4
93521,Very useful course. R from scratch. Thank you very much.,4
93522,"Nice cource, well explained material that is address.",4
93523,"The lectures and Swirl exercises are extremely easy to understand and follow, but then the assignments are incredibly complicated and difficult. The assignments ask for techniques that aren't focused on or even covered in the lectures. The tips offered by Al Warren in the Discussion forum make the assignments possible to do. Since the tips are so critical to understanding and completing the assignments, I think Al Warren's tips should be incorporated as part of the core course. This course needs more time to be covered in depth - it's a lot of ground to cover in just one month,",1
93524,This course does not teach thoroughly. There is no direction or lead in to best practices.,3
93525,difficult for beginners,2
93526,great assignments. learning immensely helpful,5
93527,The course covers a lot of different topics related to R programming. I think the course explain a lot of important concepts. In my opinion the level of the videos too simple and is needed to do the practical part by yourself using swift in the console. This way you learn about what you need otherwise the class exercises are pretty complicated.,4
93528,Very helpful course for people who have beginners and intermediate level of expertise in R.,5
93529,I felt this course had the right amount of depth for the time provided. It wasn't overwhelming but was still deep enough to be useful.,5
93530,"If you have no programming experience in R, this is not the course for you,There is no link with the programming assignments and course slides.But a practice assignment is proposed at the beginning of the course in week 2.",3
93531,Actually I feel like i'm reading the instruction manual without knowing useful skills,1
93532,Never used R until I took this course. This was a good course to start with and helped me dive into the world of R.,5
93533,"I managed to complete this course, but that was because of my four years of ""MOOC-level"" ""programming experience"" and duckduckgo (~google), not because of the course material. Videos are dull readings of the pdfs, with many ""ummmm""s and annoying lip-clicks. Examples are useless, explanations are often vague or even incomplete. The assignments are relatively hard in that you don't get all the necessary info from the course, sometimes even R's own manpages aren't enough. (Which is a shame, as you'd expect a course to teach you how to use the tools you will need for the assignments.)If you have no programming experience, stay away from this course!Otherwise, if you want to learn R, look for other resources, and save yourself some time and money.",1
93534,Good Course. Learnt a lot. Thank you :),4
93535,"This is a fast-paced and autodidact course. You'll learn in a real life environment (unlike the incredibly boring DataCamp courses). Instead of providing exercises you must be curious and learn and look for whatever you want. The quizzes were always challenging, sometimes going beyond the course material -which is, in my opinion, a great decission-. I learned in a month what I could have learned in 3 or 4 with DataCamp.I thank Roger D. Peng for making this course possible.",5
93536,Excellent courser. I'm learn very much and it's a very important for my actual investigation work.,5
93537,Nice course but should have more practice exercises and Coursera should make interface more interactive.,4
93538,A great course which can help you to have a clear mind about R programing,5
93539,"A very challenging course for a beginner, but if you are ready to invest time and effort, you will definitely manage it. A point that should definitely be mentioned is that the course is not self-sufficient, so to speak: you will need to do a lot of additional research, googling, ask questions on forums and maybe even take additional courses in parallel in order to make it to the end. But once that steep learning curve is overcome, you will enjoy all the benefits and, above all, will be well-armed to continue in the specialization.",4
93540,"The course is misleading - the difficulty ramps up too quickly, with the result that those who do not have a programming background will not be able to keep up. It should be toned down and reworked, or split into two courses. Cramming everything into 4 weeks makes everything too difficult.",1
93541,"it is NOT for beginner, the student should have ""more than average"" in the programming languages, in order to get benefit from this course.",3
93542,Very useful!,5
93543,really helpful : ),5
93544,Lays a solid foundation for R. Good lectures.,5
93545,"I guess this course is part of one of the best Data Science specializations. The lecturers are very knowledgable and they explain extremely good. If you want to learn R in combination with the data science, this specialization is certainly very recommended for you.",5
93546,Great course! Highly recommended to start programming in R.,5
93547,The new platform Sucks!!!The people who just want to learn for free and not purchase a certificate are barred from attempting the quizzes unlike the old platform. Not being able to take the quizzes completely ruins the learning experience.,1
93548,I miss practical exercises that can be used to prepare the quiz,3
93549,To many text on the slides. Video resolution is not adopted for smartphone (Asus zenfone 5),3
93550,Very good course. Cover the necessary topics.,4
93551,The course is so hard for whom who don't have a Statistical background. The number of submissions are too numerous for professionnals who have only the weekend to do tem all. The course's projects must be reviewed.,4
93552,IT IS VERY USEFUL COURSER THAT I CAN SOMETHING ABOUT 人PROGRAMING,5
93553,the assignments have nothing to do with the presented material. Would have liked some practice of the concepts presented in the lectures as opposed to learning new things just to be able to do the assignment,3
93554,"A bit of a deep plunge if you've never coded before, yet too shallow to satisfactorily introduce someone skilled in other languages to the many peculiarities of R. I don't envy instructors trying to balance these two needs in such a short time.",3
93555,"Extremely hard programming assignments for people with little or no programming background. Even though these assignments were truly challenging and difficult to complete, the course complied with some of the proposed objectives.",3
93556,"My background is in software development, so I know a thing or two about writing code. I'm about halfway through the course, and I'm really struck by two things:",2
93557,"Clear, concise and interesting! It will help me greatly in my data analysis research project.",5
93558,"You can learn basic functions of R and do practical assignments on your own. However, the assignments are a little bit challenging, and students need to take some time to figure it out, especially for people who are not familiar with programming.",5
93559,"This class is packed with clear, concise and useful information. The level of difficulty was perfect for me. I learned through well designed exercises the fundamentals of R",5
93560,"I've learnt basic knowledge of R from this course, which helps me a lot about my final thesis in the college.",5
93561,This course is very difficult for beginners.,2
93562,Great Course to get started on R from zero. Thanks a ton to the Instructors .,5
93563,In Lectures rate of speech is really fast and in some presentations are not clear,1
93564,There was some mismatches between what was thought in the lectures and what was tested as part of assignment.,4
93565,"I like this course, and it's very useful",5
93566,Good fundamental overview of the programming language. I also liked the pace of the course.,4
93567,The course needs an update. Really poor presentation of the material although a lot of things are covered.,3
93568,It was really informative..but need more examples and more pratical view.,4
93569,Swirl is really very helpful,5
93570,Great class!!! Excellent study material. Teachers rocks!,5
93571,Awesome course. Thank you Dr. Peng and Team,5
93572,so so awesome,5
93573,"Poorly organized and managed. Each week of this course should have been broken down into individual 4 week courses. I have 20 years software development experience, and I can tell you this is too much information to cram into a single class.",1
93574,It would be more useful if the instructors put forward more resources to practise the programming learnt.,4
93575,Very helpful.,5
93576,Very good introductory course with well presented material.,5
93577,"The video lectures were not on par with the, in my opinion, extremely demanding programming assignments. I'd say some knowledge of advanced coding was required in order to complete the assignments, or alternatively, lots of time to learn by yourself on google and forums, which wasn't really the point, was it.",2
93578,Disorganized course materials. Gaps in the materials.,2
93579,"Learning R is very interesting and applicable. It is something I plan to continue, but not in the specialization offered here. The main reason being that the difficulty of the assignments seemed far beyond the material presented in the lectures. It could be that relevant examples on using applicable functions to aid in completing assignments were not presented in the lectures.",3
93580,"Great overview. The Swirl exercises are wonderful for ""teaching a person to fish"".",4
93581,"For someone with no programming background and limited experience working with data, this was a challenging, sometimes (supremely) frustrating, course. But perseverance through the struggle can end in tremendous gratification. Happily, this is how it was - very rewarding.",5
93582,Support material is decent but some more examples in video lectures would be good,4
93583,Top level course! Amazing!,5
93584,Brilliant!,5
93585,"Although this course covers quite a bit of the fundamentals of R programming, you will need to use the web quite a bit in order to complete the assignments if you are not familiar with R. I could complete the assignments, but it took me a very long time, as some of the required R commands were not taught in this course (granted, if you are willing to fill in the gaps through google and the wonderful answers from all the guys and gals at StackOverflow, you can complete them, as I did). If you have no previous R experience, like me, but you can hold your own at programming,(me again) you can pass the course. If you have never coded, I think the course would be next to impossible; bear that in mind.",4
93586,"Excellent environment to get acquinted with R. Specifically the Swirl programme inside R is really helpful and will get you the basics of how you can work in R in a very efficient way.For me, as a clinical researcher, some more information on how to clean your data and run your analysis would be very useful but this course is mostly focussed on programming your own functions.",4
93587,"Amazing course, it´s very instructive.",5
93588,"good! though i still not good at R, but i can follow swirl now, thx, i'll go on",5
93589,I'm a fairly experienced R programmer and still learned a few things from this course!,4
93590,This is good course for beginner to understand the R programming itself.,5
93591,"I am really unhappy with this course. Coming to R with some background in statistics and SQL, but lacking programming experience, I assumed this would be an introduction. The material in the lectures is straightforward enough, and the swirl exercises are easy to get through and informative, but the assignments are, without exception, based on writing functions in R with basically zero experience. Having no background or frame of reference for best practices in syntax, logic, etc, and very little information in the lectures or supplementary material to help, I found these to be almost impossible to complete.Furthermore, there's no mechanism or provision in the course to review the assignments after they're submitted. So not only did I not feel like I was doing the work correctly, I can't get feedback, and the lecturer doesn't break down the rationale behind the assignment, and how he would have done it or why. In addition, the assignments bear only a tangential relationship to the lecture material. So I would be feeling good coming out of a lecture and going through swirl exercises, only to be plunged into a programming assignment that was far too advanced for the small steps I felt I had taken in my overall competence with the language and material.I don't doubt that someone with better knowledge of programming can get through this stuff, but this class should be reserved for advanced learners only, or maybe be broken up into two courses. I feel like I wasted $49.",1
93592,"I've seen a general improvement in quality respect to the other about exploratory analysis, nothing else to say! Awesome job!",5
93593,Assignments do not correspond with video lessons.Video lessons has a lot of teorical concepts that are not usefull at all.There's a big opportunity to enhace this course.,2
93594,"Challenging course, but in a good way.",5
93595,Very well-designed course covering the basic groundwork for R.,5
93596,Great Lessons about basic R programming knowledge and skills.,5
93597,"I am finding it very difficult to follow, feel like I am missing a chunk of information. However I will say that everyone else seems to be managing so it is probably me missing something",3
93598,"The Data Science specialisation with John Hopkins University is definitely worthwhile and, as a relative novice in the area, I'd highly rate and recommend R Programming. The lecturer Mr Peng presents the information in a clear and concise way, conducting walk-throughs of different steps, and providing opportunity for practice exercises. As well, the accompanying book published by the lecturer, learning materials, mentor Mr Warren and discussion board are invaluable for beginners like myself. Thank you for a terrific course so far.",5
93599,Thought this course could've been much more effective. The content felt very random and esoteric at times. Especially the programming assignment on cached results. I get it. I'm a programmer at heart. But this is at the margin of usefulness. How about a segment on running regressions? Or doing some real data analysis?,3
93600,"Overall not a bad course. Needs some tidying up though. For example, the assignments seem to assume knowledge of functions not covered in the prior lessons. Same applies to the textbook, e.g. page 50 refers to the subset() function, but it is not actually covered.",3
93601,helpful,5
93602,Programming in R is different from programming in C and similar languages. After this course it is much easier to understand Python Pandas.,5
93603,It is a good overview of R!,5
93604,"Completely lost. This is not meant for rank beginners. Data Camp's free R course has been much more helpful for me than this. It doesn't have the same level of detail as this, but at least I'm not watching an instructor gloss over concepts or ideas that are completely foreign to me as someone completely new to programming.",1
93605,"The video lectures will help you to pass the quizzes, as they are primarily theory and background. The lectures will not, however, aide you in any way in completing the programming assignments. The first programming assignment is extremely difficult and very little is done in the lectures, the textbook, or in swirl to pull all of the pieces together prior to the first programming assignment/quiz. There are so many disparate concepts, that it would be nice if the instructor could at the very least, demonstrate a full analysis of some kind of tabular data in R. How to properly import the data, create the file, structure the data, and then perform some analysis. These concepts are introduced throughout the course, but never brought together in one complete project.",1
93606,One problem is that the programming assignments are not much related to the corresponding lecture.,4
93607,"Assignments can be made better. They should increase in level of difficulty , rather than making them quite tough for first time R programmers.",4
93608,"This is probably the most pedagogically inept course I have ever enrolled on. Although the content is what you would hope to find in such a course, the delivery of it is outrageously bad. When to complete your assignment, Google becomes your best friend rather than your lecture notes, you know that something is wrong. The idea that a baby thrown in the water may just learn to swim rather than drown is pedagogically retarded. Unfortunately, this seems to be the approach here...",1
93609,very useful. great programming assignments,5
93610,"I must confess that this course is difficult for who is beginning programming with R, the assignments require a lot of work and they are very involved. Nevertheless, I´m extremely satisfied. The book and the lectures are very good and the quizes and exercises forces you to really understand what you are doing or you cannot pass...it is what I really wanted! Thank you Coursera and special thanks to the instructor for his great work!",5
93611,Awesome course,4
93612,"Hi all,Very good introduction into R basics.",5
93613,Very insightful.,5
93614,Not for new programmers. The lecture material is also not logically organized and does not correspond to the assignments.,1
93615,"This is simply a great course.Well pased and full of information.The instructor is easy to understand and makes a good job introducing the language.Prepare yourself though - it is quite a lot of material. Allow yourself to ""fail"" at some point as you can take the course again.",5
93616,The difficulty of the assignments increases fairly dramatically week over week. It might be more productive to scale this content more gently by dividing it into a two-part course?,3
93617,"Excellent overview of basic commands, subsetting, and writing functions in R",5
93618,Some disconnects between assignments and lectures but you'll find that in a lot of classroom settings. Otherwise fantastic content about the basics of R Programming and the environment thereof.,4
93619,"Assignment is a bit too hard for entry level students, especially if we have to complete it in a week considering some students might be full time employees or students. However, assignment is very good for practice. Might consider adding more contents to let students learn more about build their own functions.",5
93620,Clean and very well structured. A good starting point to search for a book with similar structure.,5
93621,Nice introductional course to R! I was only missing some illustrations that would enhance the understanding of the matter.,4
93622,Thoroughly explained concepts and perfect sequence of topics.,5
93623,nice working with tools and i'm seriously loving to get to know more regarding data science. R programming helps to achieve my goal.,5
93624,good and useful,5
93625,Good intro to R,4
93626,"This course is not at all beginner friendly, really hard to follow the assignments and the lectures if you do not have a programming or R background.",2
93627,Very interesting and clear! Specially SWIRL :),5
93628,This course is very nice for beginners.,4
93629,I like it very much,5
93630,Great,5
93631,This course was very good and brief.,5
93632,"This was a very challenging class for someone who had no prior programming experience. However, with enough time and effort, I was able to succeed in the course.",5
93633,"Great introduction to R programming with some of the assignments proving challenging, but all achievable.",5
93634,Week 2 is an unreasonably difficult jump from Week 1. This course's beginner friendly lectures do not align with the level of understanding needed to complete the assignments.,1
93635,"It's a hard course, but very fulfilling",4
93636,"Awesome! It's a well-designed course for a beginner. The quizes and assignments ensured that I took an effort to browse and learn a couple of concepts in depth. Swirl exercises gave me a better understanding of what I've learnt from the vedio lectures. All in all, at the end of one month, you'll know all quick and dirty tricks to deal with huge datasets. Thank you!",5
93637,I think the jump in difficulty from week 1 to week 2 is discouraging to many students with little to no R experience.,3
93638,Really enjoyed this course,5
93639,So far this has been my favorite programming course. This is coming from a person who really doesn't like programming at all. A basic understanding is required in my profession and this course helps immensely.,5
93640,its good and still more programming problems can be discussed to ease the learners to dive interest in R.,3
93641,I like the examples provided in the lectures as they could be easily understood.,5
93642,very practical course to learn,4
93643,Fantastic introduction into the basic tools of R.,5
93644,In some cases I felt the course lecture (video) was bit tough to understand and few things could have been explained better. The Swirl complemented and filled most of these gaps.,3
93645,"Thank you for course! I really appreciate it, I've learnt basics of R. But I'd expect that there are more excercises and more features of R be highilghted",4
93646,"1) This course is NOT for beginners in R programming. Huge gap between lectures and assignments. Swirl lessons are cool, but anyway they don't explain enough.2) I understand that studying is not always a joy, but lectures of this course are boring. First, slides come with brief comments of instructor. And second, it seems like the instructor speaks with no preparation as there are a lot of stammers, tongue slips, ""sort of"", ""kind of"" etc. It annoys a lot...",3
93647,"Huge gap between theory and programming assignments, however quizzes are interesting and require some time to complete.",3
93648,satisfactory,5
93649,A great introduction to slightly more complicated R programming. Basic concepts covered well and it builds nicely to the point where you feel like you can apply your knowledge to real world examples,5
93650,Brilliant loved the whole experience. Kudos !!! JH,5
93651,"Thanks so much for amazing course , I want to say that this course is more valuable to me and i love your teaching so much and Swirl",5
93652,"Great start to get into data analysis. A little difficult for 4 weeks, but manageable.",4
93653,It is a very well organised course. I really like the swirl assignment programming assignments. It for doing exercise and learning at the same time. I am very much impressed and learning a lot.,5
93654,The class experience can be enhanced if there is more console operation.,4
93655,Great course! Difficult but rewarding,5
93656,"The videos were helpful, but too fast. Not a lot of time is spent on any of the functions of F. Swirl helps but not a lot.",2
93657,Assignments not always in line with lecture.Material is above beginner level.,1
93658,R Programming course was very helpful.,5
93659,"there is a huge distance between what you teach in the videos, which is fine, and the programming assingments which seem to be apt at an expert audience.to solve these problems I have to spend hours and hours on the internet looking at other people doing similar projects or asking for help.I agree that by looking you can get insight into what you are doing, but the lessons need to be built little by little and supported by practice.You can't slam me with these cache problems giving me an example that is hard to understand (much harder than anything seen during class) and expect me to do it in 5 hours per week. Maybe 5 hours per day.Disappointed. I wanted to use the whole course to learn about rprogramming but I will most likely try to get back the money I spent on this and let it go.",1
93660,"It was a good class to begin with however it would have helped to tailor it more towards newcomers to programming language in general. I also would have like it if Roger would have highlighted or circled, or something to specify where in the slide he was talking about. I felt that at times it was hard to follow where exactly he was talking about and what part of the code/function he was mentioning. Im a visual learner and that would have been greatly beneficial.",3
93661,I wanted to love this course so bad but unfortunately I couldn't. There was a great distance from what was taught in the lectures and what was asked for you to do in the assignments... and It's not a matter of knowing how to program. I know Ruby and Python but R is a very peculiar language itself. Perhaps they should invest more on gradual exercises like the one they advised to do on github or some easy statistical exercises... Now I don't know if I should take the next module or if I should look for something out of here where I can learn R. I see potential on this course.,3
93662,"I have some programming experience, but I often could not understand the questions being asked in the programming assignments. Not because of my skill level, but the lack of clarity in the directions. I felt that I learned a lot while taking this course because it held me accountable, but the course design could be much smoother.",3
93663,"Really liked this course, difficult one, it made me think more than usual.",5
93664,Great introduction for people with very limited programming experience. Appropriately challenging and interesting.,5
93665,Too challenging,4
93666,This course is one of the best courses I have taken! Projects are based on the real datasets and gives you lots of insights about what you can do!,5
93667,Very nice course indeed!,5
93668,"The course progressed very rapidly. Only the basics of R programming were covered in the videos, but then the assignments were SUPER hard!",5
93669,"Only the most basic of instructions for R, which are bland and easily read in the documentation or other free resources. There are very few best practices or real examples to use anything found within. The quizzes and assignments do not match the lecture material and are contrived. Not worth the money!",1
93670,Last assignment was pretty rough because there appears to be a lot of functions required that weren't covered in class but maybe it got lost in the amount of information thrown at you in the short time. Or perhaps researching how to use new functions is part of the point. Great class and learned a ton!!,5
93671,"This course is very helpful to learn R, swirl videos explain clearly all the technical skill. Assignments are very good to push my skill.",5
93672,Excellent course for everybody who wants to know about R and some programming. A basic programming background as a pre-requisite should be required because the pace of the course is very fast.,5
93673,Exceeded my Expectations!,5
93674,Good course to learn R,5
93675,"Assignments don't always align to the course content....In terms of usefulness and coverage of this course, this really is just the basics of R.",3
93676,"very organized, so helpfull",5
93677,Overall it's a good course and I've learned a lot from it. But I think It'd be great to have more examples and context on how and why use those functions. To me R is a really quirky language and isn't really intuitive to use and it doesn't have a lot of functions that other programming languages have such as push and pop for lists. I remember spending like 5 hours trying to get it to work in a way that I'm more used to but then realized it could be done in a completely different manner. Most of the time I spend so much time on trivial stuff which I think can be avoided if more explanation is provided.,4
93678,The course provides requisite understanding and is designed even for beginners.,5
93679,Designed for everyone who wants to know the basics of R along with introduction on how to play with large amounts of data and get the statistics out of it.,4
93680,"It's good introduction, but the assignment are rather poor. Not worth paying for it",1
93681,Gets progressively tougher but loses momentum in the end. I highly recommend taking additional courses in R as the programming requirements are not exponentially increasing and by the end it suddenly peaks to a huge demand.,3
93682,Great Course that introduces to R Programming. The level is high but not too difficult.It introduces to different Programming methods (new to me that come from Functional/Object-Oriented Programming Languages and environments),5
93683,The syllabus is great! And programming assignments even better.,5
93684,pretty nice introductory course,4
93685,Great overview of R with practical lessons. It was challenging and frustrating at times and I learned a lot.,5
93686,Thank you!,5
93687,First time taking on R after so many years! Great and informative course!,5
93688,The assignments were fantastic. Very challenging.,5
93689,"Easy to follow. Might be too easy for some people with experience in data analysis. However, the instructors also talk about some frameworks and insights from their experience which could be helpful even for those who have some prior experience.",4
93690,"Challenging course, but very interesting and helpful.",5
93691,"Great courses design, assignments are much harder than things taught in video. The swirl lesson, though not required, is quite helpful.",5
93692,"So far, I don't really like R.",4
93693,Very very good! Thanks.,5
93694,Peng is incomprehensible. I give up.,2
93695,really good course,4
93696,The introduction of Swirl helps beginners get their hands on R.,5
93697,"The content was great, especially the swirl() library. The instructions were a little confusing at times, but the online advisors helped to sort it out.",4
93698,I am experienced in C++/C etc and some 50% of the videos i had to rewind.The assignments are really good though,4
93699,"Thanks the teacher for the detailed explain of R programming, I feel that I start to understand R language. Hope to have more experience about R.",5
93700,"Thanks to Coursera and Prof. Roger D. Peng for offering such a wonderful course on R Programming.Before the start of this session, my knowledge of R Programming is NIL. After attending the session, I'm confident that I could program in R and level of my knowledge is more than that of fresher. Thanks for the well designed course on R.The Quizzes and Assignments are good and helped me test my understanding. These helped me improve my confidence level as well. I appreciate Professors special video session before difficult assignment. Just following these sessions closely, I could complete the assignment to my satisfaction and have confidence to attempt and complete.I completed this course in the old format. Do I need to repeat it in the new format ?The Discussion Forums are amazingly helpful in sharing subject knowledge and making the learning Fun. Getting help from some corner of the world and getting thanks from some other corner of the world makes this learning truly Universal and great Fun.Thanks again to Coursera and Prof. Roger D. Peng.Wishing Coursera and my Professors all the best and Success always.Best Wishes,S. Ramalakshmanan",5
93701,"A quick warm up course for new learner in R. I spent a week to went through the course material and most of the experiment/programming tasks. Now feel quite comfortable to basic R. The course might be improved if more time are spent on some concrete case studies. Some useful functions/routines like str, csv header preprocessing are very handy and it is great to learn these. The last part, debug and profile seem not big concerns for new learners.",4
93702,Very clear instructions and with great assignments to make you thoroughly understand the materials through practice.,5
93703,Perfect lectures full of helpful advices,5
93704,Bit tough and the professor's were rushing through the course in videos.,3
93705,"Lectures and the homework are not quite relevant. The instructor explains so little on programming, but the assignment are tough.",3
93706,"Slides and videos are a bit insufficient in order to finish course projects.Apart from that, this course is awesome!",4
93707,Now i can do more thing with R :),5
93708,"Too short, too simple, too theoretic.I found of little interest the slides, partially interesting the swirl exercise, interesting the programming assignment.I would like to have a longer course with more practical examples.",2
93709,"R Programming in Coursera is a great course. You will learn a lot about R and a lot about advanced programming. But you will suffer along the way. Every lesson brings tons of knowledge, and every quiz will leave you with the feeling you only knew half of what was needed. You will have to fill in the blanks, which is easier if you have previous knowledge of R and/or have previous coding know-how. From someone who had taken other R programming courses, I loved and hated this one at the same time. It's a great way to really learn R, but be ready to put the additional hours and reading required to successfully pass.",4
93710,"Very well explained, recommended.",5
93711,"This is NOT a step-wise introduction to R for the novice. Useful in many respects, but the uninitiated to the field need more time, slow increments in project difficulty and more thorough, step by step explanations. I think the designers of the course wrongly assume that ALL R programming should be taught in THIS course which is erroneous; it should be about laying the foundations, on which the student can then expand his/her R programming abilities.",2
93712,Perfect fantastic!,5
93713,it strength my basic,5
93714,"Good course, a bit too hectic for newbies but totally worth the effort.",4
93715,Everything initial to learning R Programming.,5
93716,An amazing course. I strongly recommend for anyone interest in learn more about Data Science or R.,5
93717,"This course is great, but the assignments are harder than I expected, it seems that there are not enough connections between assignments and lectures.",5
93718,A good course with high quality information and good presenters.,5
93719,More subject information in the course is required,5
93720,Very practical one,5
93721,Excellent course; some parts were difficult some parts were not. A go,4
93722,"This is a really useful course on the basics of R programming. The instruction is clear and friendly to novice programmer. Certainly, this course only opens the door for you, more useful stuff will be learned from practice.",5
93723,Great course for a shallow introduction to R programming.,4
93724,Excellent course with great didactic. Congratulations!,5
93725,The course gave a good overview of R language. The knity gritty things could have been explained better - for example the result of splitting a data frame does nor return a data frame etc.It wasn't for some one who had never programmed in his life.,4
93726,Very nice course for basic R Programming.,5
93727,Strong course - recommended to R learners.,5
93728,"Excellent introduction to R. I really liked the ""swirl"" interactive portion of the course. The coding assignments were very good also.",5
93729,"This was a good introduction to R programming. The assignments were very challenging, and it didn't always seem like the lessons properly prepared you for them, but I guess they just required some ""hacking"" skills (the initiative to find your own answers, on Google, StackOverflow, etc.). The step-by-step optional Swirl R assignments were very useful.",4
93730,"The content and the speed that they teach you R are actually good. But considering that we now have to pay 45€/49$ for the course you will expect more polished videos and quizzes. Some of the videos are just stutters, repetitions and filling words. It's seems like they have been in a rush without decent preparation. Also one of the quiz questions was simply wrong. This should be fixed. Furthermore some of the commands they present are deprecated and cannot be used anymore.",2
93731,"Overall this was a good course. It does assume some prior knowledge/experience of programming, which makes some parts of he course challenging for a newbie. However, I would recommend it to anyone beginning the R journey.",4
93732,Too hard. I needed more programming skills prior to this course,4
93733,Very nice course for beginners in R!!! Practice with swirl is the best of the course!!!,5
93734,Good course overall but assignments have too little guidance in how they should be completed and can its easier to use material from future lessons to solve the problems,3
93735,Very nice lectures.,4
93736,"Very disjointed and no clear progression. While it teaches the basic syntactic rules well enough, the functionality of R is explored in an ad hoc manner where the assignments have little to no relation to the week's lecture.",2
93737,"The course takes more time and is more informative than the Toolbox course. The material in the videos is quite more basic than the material in the quizzes and assignments, but that should be expected. The only improvement I would suggest is to give lecture material on the deeper concepts involved in the assignments.",4
93738,R programming is good for beginner.,4
93739,"Very essential topics, but the instructor's delivery of content is inconsistent, glosses over explanations at time, ""umms and arrrs"" a lot, talks extremely fast at times. Making this course quite hard to follow.Disclosure: English if my first language. Not new to programming. Not new to MOOC courses.",2
93740,I hope I can get more instructions on the assignment.,5
93741,Very informative and a well done start to learning R.,5
93742,Waste money and time! Do not explain very well!,1
93743,It's a great way to start learning R Programming!,5
93744,An excellent and very informative course.,5
93745,The exercises ae far more advanced than the lectures and study materials.,3
93746,"Very Interesting. I am a Management student. I want to know the Basics of R programming, This helped me in the better way. This is not for an Advance level, Simply basics and easy to learn. I would say , Before start advance R programming everyone should enroll this course.",5
93747,"The programming assignments are a great way to get your hands dirty with R, but this is not a course for someone without any prior programming experience, and I found the lectures didn't have much connection with the assignments.",3
93748,This course should have more assignments of R Programming. Remaining are good.,4
93749,Good and easy cours !,5
93750,This course is a good starting point for learning the bits and pieces of R. It shows you how to work with data in a fairly easy manner.The course is well explained and the exercises are challenging.,4
93751,"I love R. This course is a great introduction to being programming in R. It is not easy, and this is the 4th time I have enrolled and will finally be completing the course (yay!). Plan to watch all videos (I watch them on 3/4 speed) and re-watch many of them for clarification. It may be easier for those with prior programming experience. Don't let week 2 get you down, do the SWIRL exercises, and ask for help from your classmates.",5
93752,Great introduction to R syntax for someone experienced with Python and Pandas. I was able to start coding in R for my job even before completing this course.My only quibble is with assignment 2. I thought it was of limited value and would have preferred the assignment offer more exposure to the apply functions.,5
93753,"Assigments are tough, deadlines ar tough, bt isn't that the thing?)",5
93754,"It is a big challenge, but the course it is really useful! If you are determinate to learn R, get this course!",5
93755,Great basic knowledge ...,5
93756,is good but is necessary a width explication for several homeworks,5
93757,"Challenging, but it gives a good idea on rprogramming, should be taken with other learning tools outside coursera",3
93758,"BEWARE. If you are someone who is new to more advanced math or to any sort of coding, this course will be very confusing, totally unpractical, and you'll walk away not feeling like you've really learned how to use R in a real way.I was incredibly disappointed.",1
93759,"Good introduction to R. Without my programming background, I think this course would be more difficult. For example, when I think I should use a switch statement in an assignment, I already know what a switch is, I just need to search online to learn how to do it in R. At the same time, speaking as someone who's worked in software engineering, a lot of any programming job is not about being taught everything but being taught enough to then go out, search online, and find out what you need to get the job done.",4
93760,"Swirl is an amazing addition to the course! Easy to learn, great content",5
93761,Really enjoy this course even i have done lot of programming and expert in other language but content is good and very easy to understand,5
93762,"Bit unclear examples at times, scripts have excessive writing. Otherwise great experience :)",4
93763,"Good for beginners, it's challenging but once you dedicate to the course, you definitely find it useful and motivating",5
93764,You can't do assignments using the lecture materials. Need A LOT of time to finish this course.,1
93765,Really good ! I learned a lot about R programming.Thank you very much !,5
93766,"The Course is not easy for someone who is new to programming languages, I myself with 2 years of programming knowledge with other languages I found it difficult to understand, the only thing I liked about this course was swirl training it was pretty easy, fun, and clear.Assignment was too hard and the descriptions are not that clear specially assignment 3",2
93767,"Very poorly constructed. There are major jumps in the difficulty of material that are completely unnecessary. The material could very easily be broken down into more manageable and comprehensible chunks. There is no repetition of any exercise or function to engrain any of the material. This course suffers grossly from the ""curse of knowledge"". If it were structured in a way where (a) material was broken down into smaller bits, ideally as beta tested by true rank novices and (b) all materials or specific functions were presented with repetition, similar to how khan academy structures its math section, then this course would be much better. I would also assume, given a and b, that there would be higher retention and comprehension. The expected time requirements are also wildly amiss. Try beta testing this on TRUE rank novices. The program suggests that this is for ""beginners"". I find it doubtful that a true beginner would fare well in this course.",1
93768,This is a great course!,5
93769,Excellent course content and delivery. It has kick started me to move on my own pace and dive down into data sciences.,5
93770,"A great course, well explained history and theory of the language and introduction of language structures, with some practice. A great way to learn R.",5
93771,Thank you son much!!!!I really like the course.It help me in my job =),5
93772,Very very good one to start our R Journey ...,5
93773,"The video lectures were engaging with interesting tidbits thrown in to make the potentially dull topic not dull. I personally liked the rhythm and pace with which Dr Peng delivered the content. Also, the swirl exercises are a critical element of this course and I often found it effective to sandwich the swirl exercises between the video and the quiz. Doing this provided an incentive to complete the swirl practice and also made the quiz/assignment less of an exercise in 'dart-throwing' and more of validating what you've learned. Overall, great course to get started with R!",5
93774,Very useful and practical content.,4
93775,"A good class. Some of the concepts required a good deal of research to understand and use, but that research is really the heart of modern development anyway.",4
93776,great challenge to get started in R,5
93777,"You don't really learn what you need from lectures. While I agree part of the experience is having to search and figure things out yourself, this goes beyond what I would expect. I have a technical background (heavy database, Data Warehouse, sql, and coding) and it was difficult for me, I can just imagine if you didn't have a technical background.",2
93778,The connection between lectures and assignments needs to be improved.,3
93779,The assignments are highly dissociated from the course material. Also once the due date has passed sharing the best solution would help so as to give insights on what could have been done better.,2
93780,One of the best courses in Coursera!Thank you),5
93781,"This course provides a great overiew to introductory R programming. Since taking the course, I have successfully used the precepts learned here for a number of analysis projects. Coupled with ggplot2 graphics, the results became self-evident.",5
93782,Wonderful introductory course.,5
93783,"Pro: The course covers a lot of information and the necessary reference material to do the assignmentsCons: 1) This is definitely NOT a beginners course with no background with R. The assignments cover/test things that are not covered in class. Please don't advertise this to be a ""no experience required"" class. 2) The code that is presented in the lessons is overwhelming (read: daunting) to someone like me (with no experience). So it doesn't help when the instructor talks through the code. Please look at datacamp tutorials - If it wasn't for them, I wouldn't have passed this class.",4
93784,great intro course to R,5
93785,"Nice, swirl lessons are very good",5
93786,The lectures are clear and exhaustive. Assignments and quizzes perfectly compliment the content and aptly test the learning. Definitely recommended to anyone who wants to learn.,5
93787,"Excellent introductory discussions in the videos. The in-R Swirl tutorial is superb - a great way to force you to type out the basic concepts. Assignments are challenging as they leave a little ambiguity, making you get familiar with the help system and online searches. This course isn't the fastest way to get an overview of R, but it's a great way to get a little more than an overview, including some practical experience, if you're willing to put in a little time and work through some bumps.",5
93788,"I spent a year coding, working on other programming languages and came back to this one a second time. I had the same exact learning issues as before. Luckily I had a better background but still had trouble going from lecture to exams. Swirl() is great.",3
93789,"Excellent in-depth instruction, easy to follow.",5
93790,"Excellent introduction! I have been using R on and off for the last 8 years, and have also used it while doing a Masters degree, but was never given a thorough and proper introduction of the basics. This should be an absolute must for anyone using R as an analytics tool be it as an academic or an industry practitioner.",5
93791,Too much stuff is taught without teachings the basics of the language,3
93792,"Excellent teaching, outstanding evaluations! I really enjoyed it!",5
93793,"It is fantastic! Thank you Roger, Brian and Jeff!",5
93794,"Introduces to R , and directs the student towards resources for more advanced in depth readings.",5
93795,This course is amazing ! I learned so much!,5
93796,"high level teachers , and well-organized course, in a pedagogic way. Understandable for non-specialists, requires a significant amount of personnal work.",5
93797,"Great course! I got previously some basics in R and this course helped me a lot with more effective programming in R. Especially, thank you for great lectured ""functions"" module, because I never understood it and now it seems much easier.",5
93798,"I would reduce the requirement of using Git. Otherwise, good course.",4
93799,Reading quickly slides,4
93800,This course was set out in such a way that it was very easy for me to follow. I hope that all the courses in this Specialization will be as well planned and structured as this one. It was very easy to learn the very basics of R programming.,5
93801,"Excellent Program. Lots of applications. Caution: ""What you put is what you get""You put lots of effort, then you learn a lot. Don't expect yourself to be fed with all the information, you also have to do your additional research.This is course is not for the ""bottlefed"" students.",5
93802,"i generally think the course needs a lot of improvement as after week 1 the assignments and quizzes don't seem to relate to the course content. we are at very different levels so a more gentle easing and explanation of ideas is necessary other than this apparent quantum leap from one stage to the next. i have had to do a different course else where and i am getting the sort of good introduction into the R language, its not practical to expect everyone to understand the ideas in 4 weeks.programming is hard enough as it is.",1
93803,Homeworks are more complicated compared to the class examples.,4
93804,"The teacher goes very fast with the concepts without really spending much time on each of them. It will be great if instead of covering all things in short amount of time, the teacher could write R code using each type of function in console so that students know exactly what to expect.",1
93805,This is the base for the Data Science Specialization. It is s serious course and an excellent introduction to R Programming.,5
93806,Good introduction to R!,4
93807,"""R Programming"" forces you to dive in deep.These skills serve as a strong basis for the rest of the data science specialization.Material is in depth, but presented clearly. Highly recommended!",5
93808,Good Introductory course on R language,3
93809,The content is superbly designer for a beginner. The Swirl assignments need to make compulsory. Infact they contributed more to the learning process. More Swirl contents will make the course richer.,5
93810,Excelente opportunity to learn a lot. The course is very well prepared introduce you to R programing. Dont feel bad if you dont get it at te first moment. It will be a process of leaning worth trying,5
93811,"The course had too much stuff crunched (and poorly explained) in too short a time period. That said, I got something out of it using a self-directed approach.",3
93812,"While this course advances at a fast pace, and Week 1 fits the needs of beginners, Week 2 is intermediate. It took me 9 months to be able to complete Week 2's assignments!Still, the course is quite good as a measure of progress for beginner-intermediate R programmers, and it helped me a lot in my way to Data Science. I'm sure coming back to pay for the whole certification.",5
93813,"If you are a beginner, this course's assignments will be quite difficult to solve but not impossible. Nevertheless, the course will give you the incentive to try and learn on your own, with the help of Rforums, the Coursera discussions, Google etc. I would appreciate it if some things would be explained in more detail. A beginner most definitely needs more time to spend on the course than the hours estimated.",3
93814,"This is a challenging course because there is a marked gap between the video lectures and the weekly assignments. This course will be far more demanding of your time and willingness to fail that the Data Scientist's Toolbox. If you have the time and resilience to search out support materials and frequently peruse the Discussion threads, you will be able to find what you need. My peers with programming experience confirmed that there is too wide a gap between the content delivered in the video lectures and the demands of the coding assignments. If you decide to take this course, be sure to do the swirl exercises so you get a feel of how the R functions work. When you grade your peers' work, you might notice that more than a few decided to plagiarize code from others.The videos need to be redone. Effective instructors know that students learn by seeing examples, not by listening to broad descriptions of what a function can do.",2
93815,Learned a lot! Super challenging and fun!,5
93816,"It was a decent introduction to R programming IF you already have some programming experience. I would never recommend this as a first programming experience to a novice programmer. That would be like throwing someone who has never swam in the Atlantic without a life boat! That said, if you have some programming knowledge to begin with, the Week 2 and Week 4 programming assignments were good. Week 3 was disjointed; it had NOTHING to do with the lectures from that week. I found the Week 3 programming assignment to be tor easy and, frankly, not very valuable as a learning tool.",3
93817,"what a course, keeps one up to standard.",5
93818,Well organized,5
93819,Excellent course for those interested in learning another programming language and acquire a support for studies in statistical and engineering.,5
93820,This course helps to become good in learning fundamentals of R Programming language. The assignments were challenging and helped me learn a lot,5
93821,Pretty decent course for learning R basics,4
93822,I strongly recommend this course for those who is starting Data Science. This course briefly introduces the R language and for what it is used for.,5
93823,"I think more detail statements are needed on PDF.Because I'm not good at listening, so I studied by PDF.",4
93824,"Great course. However, more examples in the contents would be really useful.",4
93825,"Best beginner's course in R. You will learn all the necessary nuts & bolts of R programming, plus how to write your own functions & work with data files in R.Perfect launch pad for a career in R programming!",5
93826,A distinguished course for those who want to put their first step in learning the fundamentals of R Programming in the unceasing journey of Data Science .,5
93827,Great introduction to R programming. Thanks to all team that worked in this course!,5
93828,Appropriately challenging and sequenced.,5
93829,I found the jump in difficulty for the first assignment too great. This seems to be a view reflected elsewhere.,1
93830,I think the video is much easier than the quizzes and assignments. There is a big gap between the weekly video and the quizzes.,4
93831,This was truly a challenging course if you're unfamiliar with scripts...in addition the course moves at a moderately fast pace but assignments are doable. Do the r (swirl) assignments.,4
93832,What a great class. Amazingly intensive and I'm learning a lot!,5
93833,"The course is excellent and cover many tasks that usually you perform with R. However, on my opinion assignments are not really focused on the topic of the classes, they are not really explained and above the grade of the classes.",3
93834,A very interactive beginner's course. Enjoyed the programming assignments thoroughly. Best Regard to the Team.Abhishek,5
93835,Very comprehensive course to get on track with R!,4
93836,good course with perfect interactive exercises,5
93837,strongly recommended for those who doing data analysis,5
93838,"Don't take this course unless you have a programming background. Week 2 has a programming assignment that is way to advanced for students without any programming knowledge. This assignment deals with functions, where the code is complicated. What's unfortunate is that you have to finish ever assignment, including this impossible assignment (for beginners) to get recognition for the course. I spent most of my time researching other sources for information because the lectures, and the supplemental information given on a different site, by the instructor (which indicate knowledge that the lectures are insufficient) give trivial examples when the programming assignments are anything but. This course needs some serious adjustments, either with the prerequisites needed for success in this course, or with the material within the assignments themselves.",1
93839,"Great class, plenty of resources to find help. The resources are great especially since the class is only 4 weeks long. It really helped me to stay caught up.",5
93840,An excellent tuturial invaluable for every analytical scientist!,5

93842,Great Learning,5
93843,"I really enjoyed learning R and stepping up the skills for using R. I really appreciate this great opportunity to learn exquisite classes for free at home. I do think this is as amazing as the Industrial Revolution. It is the Educational Revolution!BUT it seems errors occur (in some assignments), and I feel the level of classes is getting higher/tougher suddenly. I feel overwhelmed and challenged from assignments in week 3.&YOU GUYS TALK TOO FAST. (well, it surprisingly didn't affect to my understanding though). PLEASE! like myself, there are many many ESL students taking this course. I really don't think my English is poor (trust me, my undergraduate major is English lit and i wrote my final thesis for master's degree in ENGLISH as an ESL) but sometimes doing assignments and understanding lectures were challenging...Maybe that's because it takes time to get used to all the technical terms that has nothing to do with my major or career so far. But I think, not just JHU, but all the good universities providing courses need to consider ESL students who wanna learn more and pursue their dreams.Also it will be really great there are more ways to earn some degrees and more support for using the knowledge and skills I learned here for my career. (with reasonable price!)Thank you for the wonderful course, JHU! Hope I can go to JHU in US someday.",4
93844,"Great course really helpful. But only 4 stars, because I wasn't really prepared for the 2nd Assignment (Lexical Scoping), based on the lectures, and the cache assignment operator wasn't well explained.",4
93845,"I am very frustrated by the disconnect between the lectures and programming assignment in this course. The lectures are very basic, but that makes sense for an intro-type course. The programming assignments, however, have very little connection to the lectures. I have some experience using software with command-based interface (including R) for statistical analysis, and I am relatively good at searching and finding information independently, but this course was way too hard even for me. I might revisit programming assignments again once I have more time and more experience with the application, just for the sake of completing the course, but I kind of find it silly that I need experience with R to pass the course intended for people with little to no experience with R.",2
93846,Really important and well delivered course.,5
93847,"Very useful course for getting started in R Programming. I would advise to take this course for everyone, who is interested in working with data. I had a pleasure to complete the tasks and to get knowledge about new things! Thank you!",5
93848,Excelent introduction to the R programming language,4
93849,"Wonderful course! I had never programmed in R before and this gave me all of the foundational tools I needed. It gives you just the right amount of hand-holding while also requiring you to think critically about what you've learned and what you need to use to accomplish the assignments. I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in learning R. Also, the ""Swirl"" library that was used for basic R exercises was fantastic.",5
93850,"Good course to start learning R,but still missing some explanations in the lectures regarding programming assessments.",4
93851,Really good structure and introduction to R. It stands as a solid foundation for the rest of the specialisation.,5
93852,Extremely useful. Enjoyable to learn. Course program is developed smart.,5
93853,"Excellent course. I learn a ton. I'm already a programmer in a different language, yet I still found the class appropriately challenging. The lessons and exercises gave me enough information to know what I was trying to accomplish and where to find the answers, without spoon feeding me solutions. That suits me well, because I learn more from figuring things out than I do from regurgitating information.",5
93854,Great stuff!,5
93855,One of the best courses for the beginners,5
93856,This course was really nice and it taught me fundamentals pf programming in R,5
93857,Great !,5
93858,"Super satisfied with this course! Lecture videos are top quality, the PDF is available which makes studying and going back to the material more easy. The swirl programming lectures are very well done. I learnt more than I expected, quicker than I thought I would! Thumbs up!",5
93859,There is a wide gap between the lectures and the practice. Its clear that the video material is completely inadequate and insufficient for the course. A poor introduction to programming.,1
93860,"Difficult to follow if you are new to any type of programming. This is not a beginner's course. Best to take this course after trying Swirl, Data Camp, or Code School.",2
93861,Really hand overview of R and common development practices in R. SWIRL is definitely the one that must be attended in order to get best understanding on the subject if no prior experience in R.,4
93862,"Very interesting, sometimes there's things that you have to figure out by yourself to go on.",4
93863,The gap between the lecture materials and programming assignment is enormous. So much of lecture seem to be on the history and theoretical of R programming that it completely fails to cover the material needed to actually completed the programming assignments. Incredibly disappointing!,1
93864,"This course is VERY abstract and I find myself rushing through the videos to get to the practice/quiz so that I can trial and error my way through the project..... hoping for the best. Neither am I excited about starting the lesson each week because there is no real world problem/or data set I'm continuously practicing from. The lessons are essentially a reference guide and not a useful approach for teaching. If I wanted a reference guide, I'd just pick up one of the various handbooks/books on the markets that list R codes and their functions. A better way to teach/present this course is by infusing actual, real world examples or cases throughout the lessons instead of just listing a function and talking through its corresponding activity/response. Ideally, the real world example would be introduced in the first lesson in Week 1 and that data set would be used throughout the course(s) to apply and practice newly introduced functions. Teaching from this perspective would likely make the concepts much easier to grasp and importantly, RETAIN. The lessons, as they are currently presented, encourage rote memorization and rob the students of actually applying the concepts/code taught.Also, I love the idea of this specialization. However, I think the professors need to work more closely with online instructional designers to make the entire series more palatable for online learning. It very much feels as if they have adapted a traditional course on their own without the help of professionals who are skilled at designing online courses. If the aforementioned is the case, the professor(s) should be commended for their efforts, but there is definitely more work to be done to make this an engaging course I'd recommend.PS - I am taking notes and I have some experience with STATA so this type of coding/anaylsis is not unfamiliar to me. I can only imagine how novices may take to the lessons.",2
93865,Hard but gives satisfactory knowledge.,5
93866,Excellent teaching and good course,5
93867,The course videos are hard to follow. The Swirl package is good,3
93868,I am really thankful. This course provides a very thorough set of skills for practically using R.,5
93869,"They don't give enough inputs and instructions to complete the assignments, unless they could offer addicional material.",1
93870,very useful,5
93871,Very good introduction to programming with R. Surprisingly large amount of content for short period of time,5
93872,It is great and very comprehensive.,5
93873,good. this lecture inspire me to work hard. study hard and think hard.,4
93874,Good course. Would have been great to see a few more examples to explain concepts but otherwise great flow and good support through swirl coding practices.,4
93875,I am loving it! Love the swirl lessons in Rstudio!,5
93876,Very-well structured and useful course!,5
93877,Great course!,5
93878,Some problems with quiz,4
93879,good course,5
93880,"Awesome Course, Good documented, effective videos and great new platform. Thanks Coursera for offering such a nice courses.",5
93881,"I was really hoping to complete the data science specialization, but I have found the first couple of courses to be not very cohesive. This course in particular was ok, but lectures and application (projects and assignments) had such a wide gap between them I found that I was mostly teaching myself...",2
93882,Amazing course to learn R programming,5
93883,"I rate this course as the beta-testing (not that I had completed this course prior the beta started).1) the course is still very good with a lot of explanations and examples2) I liked the part about debugging because we don't see often this topic when learning a new language.3) I liked (but it's only a cosmetic thing) that all the slides have the same template/organization ; it's easier later when we looked back at the lessons to find what we search.4) one (very) minor comment : I watched the videos with subtitles (english) and sometimes it also writes when the instructor thinks ""loud"", or repeat a word several times",5
93884,"I think making this course self-paced is a great idea. This is a well put together course. My only concern is for those who have not done programming before. Maybe a prerequisite course could be recommended? I recall doing an excellent Python for beginners course recently. Personally I'm not a big fan of peer correcting, I know this is a big part of making Coursera work, but for classes like this one, I think something like SWIRL would work best. Anyway, that was my two cents. KEEP OF THE GREAT WORK, YOU GUYS ROCK! :)",5
93885,Excellent. Very good. I loved the way it was developed. I will recommend it to my friends. It sure is among the best courses I did in Coursera.,5
93886,I Loved this class.,5
93887,"A truly absorbing and enlightening course on Roman art and architecture. Thanks to Dr Soren, I learnt a lot of things about the Romans that I did not know before.",5
93888,"A great course that provides very important and valuable insights into Ancient Roman art and archaeology. While this course moves through 1,000 years of history relatively quickly, it provides a very firm and clear understanding of the hows and whys of Roman history through archaeology and Roman art.",5
93889,Very superficial and inconclusive.The course professor focuses more on himself than on the material.,1
93890,"David is the kind of professor that could make you change your major just to be in his classes. This course is INCREDIBLY well written, intuitive, and amazing.",5
93891,~ THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR FABULOUS COURSE.YOU ARE INDEED A MOST MULTI-TALENTED PROFESSOR ~,5
93892,Really enjoyed the course! I wish there was some funding mechanisms to make this lovely person from a developing country to pursue a Masters or PhD.,5
93893,"Fantastic course, both interesting and informative. Writing weekly essays was interesting, and peer grading was challenging. Overall, I greatly enjoyed this course!",5
93894,"What's best in this course: the assignments. Requiring a short few paragraph essay answers to a few questions at the end of each week is so much better than just relying on multiple choice questionnaires. This encourages participants to do a little bit more, at least glimpse through a few relevant Wikipedia articles.Of course there is plenty of multiple choice questionnaires and videos as well. Some of the videos are a bit dated, but that makes them even more interesting as an archaeological evidence. Besides, the subject matter isn't moving forward very fast, though new research reveals new things at a slow yet constant pace.",4
93895,Very thorough and engaging. I would take other courses offered by this University and this Instructor. Thank you.,5
93896,Great Course! Some handouts would have helped by Dr. Soren's knowledge and explanations were always clear.,5
93897,Great class and I learned so much new information from the lectures,5
93898,Thoroughly enjoyed learning more about ancient Rome. The lectures are a great overview of the history of Rome with great insight from the archaeology. I'm an architect and I really appreciated the connection between architecture and the culture of Rome. I didn't realize how much of a Archaeology rockstar Dr. Soren was until I watched the BBC documentary! Thanks to the leaders of the course and Lana.,4
93899,"Excellent job on content selection, visual materials, reenacting clips, guest lectures and presentation! Truly appreciated Dr. Soren's engaging and pleasant lecturing style - his passion for the subject is truly contagious and inspiring. Thank you for putting together such an informative course that gave a good picture of evolution and demise of the Roman Empire, but did not overwhelm with too many dates or characters - not an easy thing to do given the complexity of the history and the time span covered.",5
93900,Very well prepared course. Like to learn.,5
93901,Very good and helpful. I am now a mentor for it.,5
93902,"Pretty good class.Dude, lose the dog, it's not cute, it's creepy.",4

93906,Interesting content. Engaging instructor.,4
93907,"One of the best courses on Coursera. Informative, clear, interesting, entertaining.",5
93908,"Fantastic course! Dr. Soren was engaging and informative. He's also actually worked on a lot of the archaeological sites discussed in this course, which gives a nice perspective. Look him up, he's made some impressive discoveries in his own right. particularly about the factors that led to the fall of the Roman Empire. And the cameo appearances by his dog, Lana, were always appreciated.",5
93909,"Great course, an absolute must for anyone who loves Roman history.",5
93910,Great course. Interesting material and mesmerising tutor.,5
93911,"A really interesting course, very informative and a very engaging tutor. I say this as a Classics teacher who has learned lots from these lectures. Thank you, Dr. Soren!",5
93912,Interesting and well presented. I enjoyed it very much!,4
93913,"I enjoyed the course. Lots of Roman history included. Lots of interesting videos from other experts in a particular area of study. But, I will never again take an on-line course with essay questions graded by other students. Out of frustration, I experimented by looking at the answers before taking the test so I knew I should have gotten a perfect score & still didn't get passing marks from my fellow students. I started just skipping them. Remove the essay questions & I would give this course 5 stars.",4
93914,"Excellent lectures, films and insights from Dr. David Soren, a world renowned archaeologist credited with three important discoveries of the ancient world. Learned a great deal and enjoyed it; recommend to anyone with an interest in ancient Rome.",5
93915,"To me, it is the best structured course so far. Quiz after every lesson and written assignment after every week. Also, prof. Soren is reproducing it steadily and in comprehending fashion.",5
93916,"This is my 2nd week, I´m so excited learning about Etruscan!",5
93917,"Dr. Soren explains very well all the subjects, making them very easy to be followed and understood. There is a very mix of technics during the course, using videos, maps, 3D representations, etc. Dr. Soren is really good and very, very nice person.The only thing I miss, is more weeks of course to enjoy even more this subject. It could be great to have a second part of the course, to have the chance of study Rome deeper and deeper :-)Greatings from Spain!",5
93918,"Excellent course, sorry that it is finishing.",5
93919,I didn't find the speaker very engaging. And his habit of bringing the dog into the classes was supremely bizarre.,3
93920,Really interesting and excellent course! Very educational. I will miss Dr. Soren and Lana when I enroll a new course after I finish this one.,5

93925,I loved this class but the only reason I have to give it four stars is the over amount of peer review assignments that are extensive. Otherwise it's great but be prepared to work :),4
93926,I thought the course was excellent.,5
93927,Just started today and have already learned a lot!!! Looking forward to next weeks lesson!!!,4
93928,Wonderful and interesting course! I enjoyed it tremendously.,5
93929,"This course is amazing. It doesn't just provide an excellent introduction Roman art, archaeology, history, and material culture; it also offers insight into several of the innovative sciences being utilized within Archaeology today. There are several guest speakers; tours of actual sites/tombs/museums/campus labs and architecture; 3D mapping; and even a few videos that introduce various craft making processes. Dr. Soren & The University of Arizona really went out of their way to make this a great course :)",5
93930,GREAT COURSE,5
93931,"The courses of the first three weeks were more interesting to me because of their technical orientations. I was less convinced by the case studies presented in weeks 4 and 5. The Indonesia case study was very general, for instance, and the gender planning only one of many dimensions to be considered (what about cost recovery, maintenance organization, private sector participation..?). My view is that eawag should keep concentrating on the design and management of technologies, where it is excellent, and let the planning of development projects to other institutions. The planning of urban sanitation infrastructure and services, as well as any other urban infrastructure and services in developing countries, is a very complex task covering politics and policy, institutional, organizational, technical, financial and social aspects. Summarizing the success or failure of sanitation project planning to community participation and inclusivity is quite reductive. The very low level of success in urban sanitation development compared to other services in developing countries (such as telecom and transportation) is a sad indicator that ready made solutions and fashionable acronyms (CLUES, SFD, ...) are still very far from offering successful solutions for urban sanitation improvements.",4
93932,useful to learn about the most common sanitation technologies,4
93933,Poor. Very boring and dull presentation. Hardly anything is explained very clearly. It would be far more profitable to simply study an appropriate textbook or online course notes.,1

93989,"Intro audio for each video is incredibly poor.Early course videos have too much animation; it’s distracting.Video 1.3.1- At 4.57 says “Certain jobs and tasks that are not value added are more easily outsourced. But critical functions that are part of the company's value chain or the critical functions that give the product or service value to the customer, should really be outsourced.” I assume that was supposed to say NOT be outsourced, otherwise it doesn’t make sense.Lesson 1.3: the link to the IRS page isn’t hyperlinked. You have to copy and paste.Module 1 Final Quiz: questions aren’t worded well.Mid-lecture question pop up in the middle of sentences and sometimes even words.Quote from video 2.2.2: “Did you know that over 90% of candidates are now using mobile technology to look for jobs?” Then the practice quiz question “What percentage of job seekers use their mobile device to search for a job once a week or more?” and the correct answer is listed at “68%”. There is no mention of 68% anywhere.Videos often go silent for several seconds for no apparent reason. These could easily be edited out.Week 2 quiz: Q. 6 “improve employmentoutcomes” - somebody forgot a space.Practice quiz 3.3, Q 1: “""Tell me about a time when you made a mistake"" is what type of interview question?” - Answered Behavioral, but system marked wrong (but under the answer Behavioral note says “behavioral- tell me about a time”, so obviously it actually is the right answer.",2

93998,"Very good. some lessons are not completed though, you should review the course",4
93999,"There were some real technical problems in this course. The video sound wouldn't match up in places, and the brief questions inserted into the video would come prior to us learning the content to answer the question. In addition the quiz answers would not match up to what was learned in the video. For example, one quiz asked what type of question would ""tell me about a time"" be, and in the video it literally said it was a behavioral question, but that was marked wrong in the quiz. There were also several instances where the percentages taught to us were marked wrong in the quiz. This was not as high of a quality learning experience as the first course in the specialization, so I was quite disappointed. I do hope someone will go through this course and fix the inconsistencies and technical errors. Thank you.",2

94015,Very good course and insightful.,5
94016,"Excellent course, i Loved it. thankyou :D",5
94017,Very well put together. Excellent videos and presentation of materials!,5
94018,very good course but the last part ( on bording ) need to be better,4
94019,Amy was very engaging & interesting as an instructor. The material was laid out well & easy to understand.,5
94020,Really enjoyed the material. Learned a lot.,5
94021,Great course. The instructors are very welcoming and clear. The course content covers all the Recruiting and Hiring basics for those who are non HR professional but also adds very important concepts for those who already works with it,5
94022,WoW awful presentation but great instructor. I expected much more than this but :(Leveraging employer brand is not compelete :\,1
94023,It is very helpful!!!!!,5
94024,On later parts the videos are poorly edited and less interactive. In one place practice quiz has wrong answer marked as right. (Whether it's a situational question or behavioral).,3
94025,Thumbs Up!,5
94026,Very Effective.,5
94027,"I found this course to be very helpful. It covered all the main points, was easy to understand, fun, and organized. The professors and guest speakers did a wonderful job.",5
94028,"This course seems patched together. The volume isn't consistent, even within videos. Some videos / slides are great and full of information, while others are just long periods of talking with one word or phrase on the screen and none of the information put in written form.Some of the questions occur in multiple practice quizzes. Also, there are misspellings in the quizzes. Finally, one quiz marked a question wrong and then, in the comments, noted the answer was right.Further, some of the videos seem to stretch out information to fill time.",2
94029,Very informative mod,5
94030,Good insights on Hiring and Onboarding Employees and the key to this course is the best practices followed and how differently we think when onboarding a new hire,4
94031,"Amy your are great, thanks!",5
94032,A great way to learn about recruitment and selection. Full of interesting resources,5
94033,"I think the course needs to be restructured in order to be more practical and in order to go more deeply into theoretical material. Most of the course is a little superficial. Most classes could be summarized. For exemple, in talking about selection procedures, the only tool discussed more deeply is interview. The was no discussion about personality, psychological test or other tools. Most contents of Amy`s classes are abstract. Stacy class, however is more practical. It is a nice course, but it can go more deeply into theory and most classes could be summarized.",3
94034,Amazing and very educational!,4
94035,Great course for people managers. Does not walk away thinking this is for HR only.Onboarding part is particularly awesome.,4
94036,"The subject is interesting and the instructors both seemed very competent.Still I wish the course had been better prepared as there were lots of sounds defects: you had to adjust the volume during each video which is tiresome. In the same idea, the questions during the course would pop up in mid-sentence, sometimes with too much anticipation with the subject at hand. Last, the questions in the assignments were sometimes not so much to check your understanding but your memory about a small detail like a % in a study that is already obsolete by the time we learn it...All in all a great course, with great instructors but still room for improvement as a mooc.",3
94037,"I really liked the first three weeks of this course from Amy. The content was excellent. Amy has a very detailed, thorough teaching style. Very easy to listen to.",5
94038,"This course was a bit mediocre. The videos were often choppy, awkward, and cut off in the middle of sentences. The quiz questions were unclear and generally poorly written, and didn't make me think enough. I did enjoy the onboarding special topic section, and the quality was higher there. But the first 3 weeks need quite a bit of revision and fine-tuning.",3
94039,"i really very like the onboarding couse teacher, very nice with the teaching.",5
94040,Very detailed elaboration!,5
94041,"Really intresting! I learnt a lot and now I have the opportunity to understand more things about recruiting, hiring and onboarding ! Thank you very much",4
94042,Perfect course you should have to take it,5
94043,This course is really useful for Hiring and On boarding purpose,4
94044,"the materials and videos are valuable,",4
94045,"Great course and highly recommended not just for HR professionals, but anyone that would be involved in the process. The instructors are dynamic and the materials are excellently prepared.",5
94046,good i love this course and the materialalso thank you coursera for providing us this course,5
94047,Detailed Basics even for the experienced recruiter to review for tweeks of improvement!,5
94048,Good but the part of AB testing is really neither motivating nor exciting forn IMCA,4
94049,It's amazing! I think is one of my favorites in this whole specialization! the videos are super insightful !,5
94050,"All courses within the Social Media Marketing Specialization have been brilliant. Easy to follow, with step-by-step progression and if you're completely new to Social Media Marketing, you'll find the concepts are taught in a clear and concise way. I totally recommend it.",5
94051,Horrible experience as a student. No moderator or the faculty replies to your queries. The instructor has just left the course to take its own accord. It is frustrating to get such a response when you have paid a hefty much for the course.,1
94052,Not very substantive. Seems to be a marketing ploy for those on-screen more than to be anything of use to its audience.,2
94053,"Is an awesome course, you can access great and up to date information that allowed you to succeed in your career.",5
94054,This Course is excellent and especially Prof Randy had put in a lot of effort to give this amazing series of Mooc on Social marketing. I highly recommend these Moocs,5
94055,very good content,5
94056,Excellent course. Contains a really useful information.,5
94057,"Good material, but wish it had more assignments to hold you accountable.",3
94058,My favorite in the specialization thus far,5
94059,I enjoyed the course.,4
94060,"The course is insightful and teaches real-world application of some social media strategies. However, it is not enough by itself; the specialization as a whole will be useful.",4
94061,Awesome course,5
94062,Join the winning team were all is happening. Great Course.,5
94063,"amazing course, i recommend it to anyone who want to know more about social marketing!",5
94064,Excelente Course. It needs more languages in the subtitles,5
94065,"This is nice! Cool interviewers, nice pace. Some of the terms are unnecessarily redundant, but in overall they make sense and paint a clear picture.",4
94066,The assignment is difficult,3
94067,"I loved this course because it gives you perspective on using the most effective approaches for the different products depending on the level of commitment you need from the customer. I learned that I was doing way too much work for some clients and the wrong kind of work for others. Incredible. Plus, it gets you primed and ready for the next MOOC. A/B Testing is for Winners",5
94068,Very beneficial information in this MOOC!,5
94069,"The content of this course is excellent, and I've learned a tremendous amount. It would be a 5-star course if that were the only criterion.I've become discouraged about the lack of rigor in the quizzes. A standard practice for students in online courses, if a quiz can be taken more than once, is to take the quiz before studying the material. (This is a research-supported study technique; it focuses attention on key points in listening/reading.) I'm finding that the questions virtually give away the answers. On my trial-run attempt, before the videos, I score close to or above the passing level. Because the multiple-response answers are immediately visible, a student could boost into the generous passing range on a second attempt just by seeing which boxes should have been checked or left unchecked. I can usually achieve a score of 100% on three attempts before seeing any of the material.Questions could be more difficult by requiring more discerning application of the principles, or by requiring true recall (typing in rather than choosing the information in a multiple choice format). There are dozens of ways to make questions a more rigorous and authentic assessment of student knowledge; I'm sure you know and practice many of them in your face-to-face classes.The option to repeat the quiz fails as an assessment because the questions are repeated identically even after the incorrect answers have been indicated -- and in the multiple response questions, this means that the correct answers have also been shown. A person with no knowledge of the subject matter should be able to score 100% in a maximum of 4 attempts at the quiz, just by trying each answer on each question. Thus the quiz is not any kind of assessment of actual knowledge.The assignments do require a demonstration of some ability, but the grading scheme is sufficiently generous that a person who follows the instructions minimally will earn enough points so that, in conjunction with quiz scores, they pass and receive the certificate for the course.This certificate program has high visibility in social media right now; it would be a shame for the certificate to devalue rapidly when it becomes clear to employers and students that the certificate does not, in fact, indicate that a person has passed any minimal threshold of knowledge or skill.It may be that the Capstone project is graded quite rigorously, so that any slackers from the previous classes will not earn the certificate -- but that's a bit devious too.",3
94070,Excellent source of information,5
94071,Good detailing and examples shared help to understand concepts better.,5
94072,Practical methodical approach to deciphering the social IMC and complete hands on tutorial. Randy Hlavac amazing tutor.,5
94073,"Currently I am acquiring a postgraduate degree in Strategic Marketing Management in one of the UK’s top business schools. I have started this online course because I would like to gain some experience on Content Marketing because I need it for my internship. I have finished the week 3 and I can say that I really like the content and the process of the module!Personally, I suggest this module to all the students and professionals that they want to obtain useful and practical knowledge regarding Content Marketing and Social IMC.A big thanks to Northwestern University and to all experts that worked in order to create this module!",5
94074,I had a great time learning new strategies from this MOOC! I can't wait to see what comes next.,5
94075,"More like a 3.5 to 4? Close to 4. The main problem for me with this course was the assignment. I found it a bit unclear. The instructions are clear, but the way to go about completing the assignment was not. The last assignment we had in Course 3 was very specific and even had a video specifically on how to complete the assignment and why each step was important. We were given an example as to how to perfectly complete the assignment to extract the maximum knowledge from the course. In this course, that aspect was a bit lacking",3
94076,practical and insightful!,5
94077,This is great course. It has a lot of high quality content. This is really cool for anyone who wants to be succed with social marketing in the digital world.,5
94078,"One of the best courses I've taken on Coursera. The lectures are tailored for online learning as opposed to videos of live lectures. They are short and and full of relevant, useful information. This was a huge plus for me because I don't have a lot of extra time to sit through hours and hours of lectures. There were guest lecturers who were experts in the field of social media marketing who provided great insight on the topic. I've utilized many of the strategies learned through this course and the other courses in this Specialization in my own business and have increased my social media following as well as began developing and advertising my blog.",5
94079,"Great Content, PLEASE FIX MY credit for course.",4
94080,Great content...congrats Randy!,5
94081,"Ok, course is too good for me, I had some challanges with this one because of my fear factors and trying to apply the information in a relevant way. The content and instruction is more wonderful it's me that is not at this level yet.",5
94082,"This is my favorite course of the series so far. Information dense, the hands-on class project for this unit will help unpack the mystery of A/B split testing using free online tools. Recommended!",5
94083,Topics were not taken in depth and enough clarity. I tried hard to learn in the course but lost track by the end of week 3 and the peer assignment.,2
94084,"Amazing Information, it is helping me turn around my business!! =D Thank you!!",5
94085,"very good practical assignments that help you learn smth new, interesting interviews",5
94086,It is a great course for the basic understanding of FB advertising and what a social IMC is and its importance in social marketing.,4
94087,"This is a great course. Randy explains in easy-to-understand steps how to initiate an integrated marketing communications program and how to track and test your efforts. He also does a nice job of explaining why certain steps are important and provides several valuable case studies. To top it all off, several guests appear in his lectures, providing additional insight and real-world examples.",5
94088,Thanks Professor!,5
94089,I am very excited about this particular assignment - great instructors means great instructions !!,4
94090,Fantastic course well integrated in the overall specialization. Week 3 could eventually be split in two weeks as it is more demanding in terms of peer assessment and lecture.,5
94091,This course has been an educational adventure in the social media tools being used to expand your presence,5
94092,Extremely well explained and great teachers.,5
94093,Very useful and informative.,5
94094,A very informative course,5
94095,"Really enjoyed learning the Blog.. I really wanted to start having my own and probably it was difficult for me to learn to do the same just by reading. The way it was show here was awesome and simply loved the way Maslows , Blog Promotion and A/B Split testing were covered.",5
94096,Great. Easy to understand and very practical.,4
94097,Great course with excellent examples and materials.,5
94098,Great coverage on content creating and Social IMC strategies,5
94099,Nice course. Thanks to all the professors.,5
94100,Actionable takeaways you can implement in your class.,5
94101,"There should be an instructor available to address specific grading concerns. Peer-grading is too subjective and students use their opinions as opposed to rubrics for grading, and often do not read all the material prior to assigning a score.",1
94102,Great way of instructing.,5
94103,good but videos are too long,3
94104,I am so glad I took this course! I have learnt what I consider very important aspects of virtual teaching such as identifying at-rist students or building a community with the students that engages them in the learnig. I have also had to learn how to produce a video for the students which I will use for my online course and I have also become aware of the importance of the QFT for deepening the learning of my students. Thank you so much Chris!,5
94105,It is a great course.,5
94106,It was a fast and easy course. I thought it could use more insight from other instructors. The links to other videos were useful on the text documents that were available to read.,3
94107,A really excellent course to refocus on what really matters in a virtual classroom.,5
94108,An outstanding course. Thoughtful with unique insights into some of the challenges of the virtual classroom with realistic suggestions on how to approach them.,5
94109,excellent course in terms of content and pace. nicely designed course that gives you a complete understanding of the subject.,4
94110,The BEST course in this series by far! This is a real model of what I hope to achieve with my own online courses. Finally!,5
94111,"No option of completing the course without paying. So why do you call your site FREE online courses? And why do we have to go into the trouble of attending the class and watching the videos, and reading the material without being capable of at least watching our results in assignments?I am a member of your site for many years and I have also recommended your site in many people.",1
94112,Very cute and nice professor!,5
94113,LOVED the course. it was so diverse and made me do each assignment which was really good,5
94114,"Of course there are several contents in few lectures, but I think it is a good course that help you to get started with the sale process. The speaker, Craig Wortmann, is pretty passionated about the topic.",4
94115,real guide to make your sales in the right way,5
94116,I genuinely enjoyed this course. It is very practical and helped building understanding and confidence in sales.,5
94117,Have just audited this course and found the content very useful and versatile. Excellent presenter. Will be paying for this course as homage for the value it has already added to my existing skill set.,5
94118,"Amazing course, it will help you be successful anywhere and in life itsefl",5
94119,good class - with valuable lessons learned. wish the class could have been a bit longer and maybe more focused in some areas.,5
94120,Excellent course and really well put together. I definitely learned a lot from Professor Wortmann.,5
94121,"Excellent, thank you... now changed the sales process in my business!",5

94123,This is a must have course for any sales person - entrepreneurial or corporate!,5
94124,Great course for everybody who want to do a business.,5
94125,very helpful but i finished it and there are no results to see!,4
94126,its a great course to learn sales but its doesn't include the process of generating leads and there is not much support from mentors on the discussion forums.,4
94127,very useful module for those planning to pursue serious sales career.,4
94128,Good course to learn new techniques!,5
94129,"This course saved me. I started my business but nobody knew I existed. For entrepreneurs, it doesn't matter how good you are in your field. You need to be able to sell your services or product to customers. New clients will not come to you. You have to go to them. And that's how this course saved me. It guides you through the selling process right from defining your market through to closing the sale. Before the course, I had no concept of this process. Now I feel confident executing the sales process and getting my first clients through a SALE rather than word-of-mouth. A highly recommended time investment for entrepreneurs. Thank you Mr. Craig Wortmann.",5
94130,Brilliant course - very practical in its approach,5
94131,Perfect for entrepreneurs! Start with nothing and finish with a must have selling toolkit.,5
94132,"Great course, I learned alot and this has helped me greatly.",5
94133,Great course. Very interactive and with good material to learn in a practice way.,5
94134,Great course!,5
94135,"Great course, gives clarity on the approach that a sales person should take. Most importantly at each step I now know when to go ahead and when to step back.",5
94136,"Very good , well distilled and concise.",4
94137,Great Course!,5
94138,Excellent course which is immediately applicable.,5

94142,Very useful. Prepares you for every real life situations.,5
94143,pretty resourceful and useful in our life,5
94144,"Craig is great, he is a natural teacher, passionate and clear in his delivery. This course has given me skills and knowledge that will empower me in my entrepreneurial journey. Thank you Coursera and Chicago Booth Business School. Great work!",5
94145,"Thanks both Prof. Craig Wortmann and Chicago Booth School of Business to share this valuable program with us. I have never thought I could attend a program that may change my career this much.And honestly, I wish there were more starts I could give to this course for its valuable professor, all the lessons, and being categorized into meaningful parts wisely.Thank you Coursera for this opportunity, I may attend more programs in the future. However, I wish you were listed my beautiful country, Iran, to the list of your approved countries. Right now, we can not pay for any classes as our country is not listed.Regards,Sadegh",5
94146,"The course is really helpful for those, who is planning to start own business or succeed in sail. It gives very realistic tools for the sales person or entrepreneur, that would definitely help to increase volumes and list of potential clients.",5
94147,"Thanks Craig,You made this very useful and immediately applicable by the way you taught and of course the content. Great work. Appreciated.",4
94148,"This course help me to write more proficiency and insign about sales. At first,I think that sales is just telling people about things and then try to sell it.But when you have learnt this course your sales must be think in systemetic ways by sales engine(tools to use for selling).",5
94149,"Sharp, immediately-actionable and very well presented. Five thumbs up.",5
94150,This course changed my whole perspective of business for a good ! Great course!,5
94151,"Good frameworks that make a foundation. This course makes me realize selling is a critical skill. And Craig has done a great job at demystifying it. However, a lot of it is writing your own tool kits, assuming you already have successful sales experience. But that's what I realize I lack and that motivates me to take the course from the first place. If I had the right sales approach, then I would have been super successful already. Therefore, I would like to see more real examples that delve into the complexities of real-world selling situations. Also, Craig has an awesome personality: super high energy, very eager to engage; this makes me wonder the extent to which one's personality determines the effectiveness of the selling process. I, for one, am more of an introvert; so this begs the question if the introverts will need to do something differently to be as effective as the extroverts such as Craig. So, I encourage showcasing different approaches from already experienced salespeople from a wide range of personalities. In sum, I encourage the faculty to take this course to the next level by incorporating situational cases and how sales people of a wide range of personalities have handled difficult sales situations successfully, and/or how someone else have handled them unsuccessfully.",3
94152,Been really helpful.,4
94153,Great Framework for sales process and techniques.,5
94154,Good One.,5
94155,Great course for broadening knowledge for starting or experienced salespeople and entrepreneurs,5
94156,The course really helps me build up many essential skills and I would like to say thank you to Crag for all the time you accompany with me,5
94157,"This course is an excellent survey of introductory sales techniques and thinking. In addition, it allows you to access Craig Wortmann's ""Sales Toolkit"", which I think is highly valuable and able to be carried over into other personal/professional situations. However, the rigor of feedback from classmates was sometimes lacking, and the problem sets/videos took hardly any time. More time could be spent on them, but without more intense feedback from seasoned sales professionals, it might not be worth the investment. Overall, I am satisfied with having paid for this course in order to get that feedback and the certificate.",4
94158,It's an amazing course.,5
94159,The course teaches you how to sell in real life which very few books/courses cover. The assignments in the course are really engaging and make you think through. The assignments make the retention of the course easier.,5
94160,"One of the best MOOCS I have ever taken, across the different platforms. The enthusiasm that Professor Wortmann exudes in the recorded videos is contagious, can't even imagine what it must be to attend the course in person. Actionable steps which can be emulated in real life and close that much eluded deal. Simply fantastic. Grateful to the Coursera team for providing this course for thousands like me,who, otherwise would never get the chance to be part of this great course..",5
94161,This was the first Coursera course that I have completed and it was excellent from start to finish. The quality of the content was high and the workload was what I would have expected for a course like this. I would strongly recommend this course to anyone looking to enhance their existing sales knowledge or to develop this weakness in their skill set.,4
94162,Great course a,5
94163,"Great tools, great videos. Valuable, but hard assignments.",5
94164,Unable to start the course. The page re-loads again and again in an endless loop!,1
94165,"I love the energy and expertise that Craig displays, the examples of the different approaches also really helped.",5
94166,"Great insights from Craig. I loved this. Already being in Sales, it was wonderful to take his help enhance my skills.",5
94167,I enjoyed every bit of the course and the Instructor Craig Workman is an astute teacher and a Super Salesman. His teaching style is dynamic with practical insights to bring his classes into real life outcomes. I recommend this course for any Salesman who wants to refresh and learn new skills about closing and retaining more sales deals!,5
94168,"Awesome Course, thanks to the instructor!Requesting to launch some more advance courses on Sales Strategies, Account Management, etc.",5
94169,Craig is such a professional sales-teaching that I learnt a lot from him. Now I'm confident to start pitching potential leads that might fit my business. Thank you!,4
94170,"This is the best Sales course I have ever done! I have learned so much I can use in my every day work and private life. I highly recommend this course to anyone, who wants to take their sales activity up a notch. Classes ae well structured and easy to follow.",5
94171,The course is very well done and taught and 100% useful in the real world. The Sales Toolkit that comes with it is very effective and helps you to focus on the real key elements needed to be effective in the different phases of the sales process in the real world. A must do course for every sales person (and not only).,5
94172,THANK YOU!,5
94173,Thank you so much,5

94176,Very nice course with very good materials!,5
94177,"The most interesting course I have taken regarding Sales so far. Prof. Wortmann is very engaging and the lessons are very interesting to follow. I would recommend this course to anyone looking to start their own business, Getting into full time sales or even people looking for a career change.",5
94178,Proudly say I am one of the graduates of this course .. a wonderful and very practical and useful,5
94179,Simple & brilliantly spaced to learn & practice selling techniques & the strategies that they emanate from,5
94180,"very informative course, great tools for understanding & implementing success in sales, well worth the time, highly recommend",5
94181,Useful and practical skills that can be applied to many aspects of work and life,5
94182,"Excellent info, very well done one of my favorite. I was skeptical at first thinking i would hear the same vanilla sales talk but this course is so much more glad I did it.",5
94183,Great course. I just finished the first week and it is engaging and professional. I already know I will learn a great deal and apply in my entrepreneurial ambitions and professional career. The Sales Toolkit is really a great tool.,5

94185,Great course with practical lessons and advices that can improve your sales skills.,4
94186,"Subtitles are not in sync, high quality and neat teaching",4
94187,"Excellent course material and assessments. If you want to be good at selling, better take this course.",5
94188,This is one of the best classes I have ever had in my 8+ years of academic studies and 3+ years of MOOC experience.,5
94189,Very useful course. Great tutors.,5
94190,"First I want to thank very much the instructor in the online forum. He helped me a lot at the end of the course and his tutorials for gh-pages are excellent. He was also very fast in responding. Thank you.The course did ultimately not really gave me what I was looking for. Maybe too may different facts and not enough depth. I am not sure that I can confidently say that I can build a ML model now. Technically I can, but the deeper understanding is missing. For example: When would I use which method (for example rf versus naive base), the last exercise about cross validation was not fully clear. Using the caret package is too high level for a learner. It would be better to see some more step by step examples. It was not clear to me what the expected error calculation in the last exercise was really looking at. Maybe what is missing a swirl exercises, not using caret. and then explaining how caret can simplify it. We also learned how to create a predictive model, but did not go into how the model gets updated and gets retrained, an important aspect of ML. i also do not see unsupervised learning to be covered.",3
94191,good course,4
94192,Best course of the programme. Simple and explained well.,5
94193,"This is such a cornerstone topic to the Data Science Specialization that I think it deserves a better designed and more polished curriculum. The subject is so extensive that it might be worthy to split the contents in two courses. Finally, I would like to suggest the authors of the course modeling the curriculum following the amazing treatment of the subject found in ""Introduction to Statistical Learning"" by Hastie, Tibshiriani et. al.",3
94194,Really hands-on compact introduction!,5
94195,Jeff Leek is a great professor .The delivery of the course material is very clear and covers a lot of predictive methods by using mainly R's caret package. Recommended for sure.,5
94196,"This course was a big let-down compared to other courses in the specialization. It doesn't seem like a lot of effort went into course planning and creation. Much of the content is unclear and there is little depth. course textbook, and some swirl exercises would have helped.",1
94197,Very good summary of strengths/weaknesses of various machine learning algorithms. This lecturer's style and production quality is much higher than in the previous two courses in the specialization series.,4
94198,"Yet again an excellent course by Jeff, Roger and Brian. Thank you very much for a well layout course and some good excersizes.",5
94199,"Good course on the whole, learned a lot and enjoyed it, but it would need to be updated and corrected (certain bits of code don't work as they did when the course was produced, which can be pretty confusing). Would be nice also to add some more content at the end of the course : the lecture about unsupervised prediction felt rushed, and a proper conclusion opening up to the rest of the field would be useful. Anyway thanks again for this wonderful learning opportunity, keep it up ! Cheers",4
94200,This course is a good introduction to machine learning algorithms with R,5
94201,"very good, but if it has swirl practice like th other courses it would be perfect.",4
94202,"So why four stars vs five stars, of all the Data Science Certification courses that I have taken: i) some of the examples and quiz challenges don't work as they should, ii) Machine Learning is rapidly changing area - should be updated to reflect this and perhaps a high level taste of Deep Learning, iii) posting the Final Project is overly complicated relative to methods of the other courses - this should be cleaned up - still not clear how point to a github repo link and also have a rendered html page working from that same link - requires two links to present materials and must use default names like index vs. a project name.",4
94203,"Very shallow content - broad, but not deep. Not many assignments instead of the last one. We hear what we heard before. For the same price, Analytics Edge at EdX is far better choice for practical machine learning.",2
94204,Very useful course to develop level knowledge in machine learning.,4
94205,Very good course. The content can be enriched with some more technical details behind the various techniques. There needs to be 1 more course on Practical Machine Learning in the specialization as 1 course is far too less for such a vast topic.,4
94206,"Nice, clear and concise.",5
94207,Instructor rushes the course and does not explain much in the same level of details as respective quiz requires,3
94208,"Issues of every stage of the construction of learning machine model, as well as issues with several different machine learning methods are well and in fine yet very understandable detail explained.",5
94209,"While the overview of the content seemed very reasonable both in scope and pacing, the lack of swirl exercises meant that the final project for the course was a bit jostling. Overall, I think this course still needs some development in the way of exercises to familiarize the student with the practical exercises associated with machine learning.",3
94210,"mentorship was great, but the video lectures were almost useless.",3
94211,Great course! The hands-on approach make it very useful for one to start doing some very interesting analysis in real life! Thanks a lot! You guys could only make some efforts in updating some classes and packages used in quizzes. But the rest was great!,4
94212,I like initial courses like Exploratory Data Analysis but later on it got harder to follow the lectures. A lot of topics were just rushed through and little effort was made to make them engaging or interesting.,3
94213,"Really enlightening! It has short videos that fully explicate and explain the concepts and also give you code you can use! The code actually works! I would prefer that the instructor get a proper microphone so his voice sounds not so harsh, but this can be forgiven, because the content really is awesome!You can also download all the lectures (and there are transcripts, too), which is great for later reference.Try it - you will like it!",5
94214,"In my opinion, the best course of the entire Data Science Specialization",5
94215,Great course,5
94216,"The videos are really tutorials on R functions for machine learning and data wrangling. A good substitute for ""Machine Learning"" by Andrew Ng in terms of managing data sets and exploratory analysis.",3
94217,PML is a deep subject and this course is an excellent foundation for further studies. Prof Leek has taught brilliantly on the basic concepts of PML given the short time of 4 weeks. You need college level statistics to fully appreciate the theories of the PML's lectures.,5
94218,"One of the best courses in the Data Science Specialization,",5
94219,"Superfluous but the existence of the package ""caret"" covers the gap of other libraries like ""skilearn"" of python",3
94220,"By using the caret package, this course took a very pragmatic approach towards machine learning. It demonstrated how to perform all the essential tasks in making the machine (algorithm) learn from data.In my case, this course required a dedicated time commitment for successful completion. In addition to course lectures, i used the 'Machine Learning with R' book to fill my knowledge gaps. Overall i feels that this course helped me in my journey of gaining a better understanding of this subject.",4
94221,First 3 weeks are manageable and the final project is great! I had a lot of fun :),4
94222,very clear explanation,5
94223,"This course is rather bad, not well rehearsed and hastily delivered. Especially in comparison with other, in-depth course of this Specialization. The course is more of a 'caret' package review then actual Machine Learning. I learned how to use the",2
94224,Top 3 course of this specialization.,5
94225,not what I expected for a machine learning course,2
94226,"excellent course. Be prepared to learn a lot if you work hard and don't give up if you think it is hard, just continue thinking, and interact with other students and tutors + Google and Stackoverflow!",5
94227,Very good overview and straightforward explanations of the different methodologies of ML. Nice tips on how to do ML with R.,5
94228,It was like opening up a door to a whole new world. I have discovered new tools that I will thoroughly enjoy to use for the exploration of data and for predictions. Thanks Team Coursera !,5
94229,"Excellent and useful course.Some of the materials covered in Week 4 should be distributed to earlier week(s). The current Week 4 video coverage, quizzes, and the course project on accelerometer data is too much for the week, esp. if the student has lookup and review some key concepts from the resource links in the video slides. Video lectures are informative and easy to follow, although somewhat rushed in Week 4.",5
94230,"Excellent course, very practical !I am very curious about the maths so I will add some specialized certifications",5
94231,briefly summarised the machine learning algorithms. Good place to start!,4
94232,"Enlightening! Bring together all previous courses, feel now i am ready to try solving some real life Data Science problems. Great course. Thank you JHU team",5
94233,The best,5
94234,Materials in class are not suficient to understand the subject. There is missing swirl excercises and other hands on practical work. In Data Science specialization this one is the one with most space for improvement. Keep the good work. BR,3
94235,Too different for beginners but not deep enough for ones already know R.,3
94236,Excellent course. I feel like i know so much already even though we scratched the tip of the iceberg. Will definitely enroll in more advanced courses.,5
94237,The quiz should be constructed in a way that depends less on the version of the libraries used. The rest of course was excellent.,4
94238,"Awesome course. Jeff Leek does a truly amazing job at explaining very complicated concepts thoroughly and quickly. I'm surprised we went through as much material as we did. Out of the 9, this is one my favorites.",5
94239,"As the title states, very practical way to show you how this is done in R.Most of them are lines of codes and some explanation. There are tons of details behind that and remains un-explained.As other courses in the specialization, students need to do a lot of self-study to further understand machine learning.But at least, learned a lot.",4
94240,My name is Jose Antonio. I am looking for a new Data Scientist career ( https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseantonio11)I did this course to get new knowledge about Data Science and better understand the technology and your practical applications.The course was excellent and the classes well taught by the Teachers.Congratulations to Coursera team and Teachers.,5
94241,"The topic is too big, for one course from my point of view.",3
94242,"good course, but one who is serious about data science should view this course as a starting point since machine learning is a semester long course so I'd recommend follow up with machine learning course taught from Andrew Ng out of Stanford",5
94243,"The best course of the specialization along with the statistical inference one - the final assignment is very fun to do, pretty much like a Kaggle competition.",5
94244,Beautiful insight into ML,5
94245,"Great intro to machine learning. Several algorithms with some ideas on sampling and pre-processing techniques are covered. Adding a textbook as done with some of the other data science classes would help, but other resources are referenced.",4
94246,Great course. Only missing piece is the working information / maths behind the models. But as the name suggests it teaches practical approach towards machine learning.,4
94247,"It very well done, good pace, and gives you real and concrete elements and examples to build a fully functional machine learning algorithm! i recommend this course",5
94248,"Although again very interesting, I found the lack of additional materials such as practical exercises, swirls and a book reduced the depth of the course knowledge for me. Maybe we have been spoiled by the previous courses :-)",3
94249,"Lectures were not very detailed.Quizzes were good and challenging, but too many times the results didn't match the answers even when the random seed was set rightFinal project should have been more challenging with more models to build and compare",4
94250,Good content as an introduction to Machine learning!,5
94251,"Nice introduction to machine learning in R. It is rather basic level, so it not for people that already know some basics related to regression and classification.",5
94252,"Gosh I hated hated hated this course. Nothing to learn here. You will just be given lots of names with no explanation whatsoever.I often felt really angry at the teacher because of the way he would introduce entire prediction models without explaining anything about them. Also, I really didn't like the fact that the course is centered on caret, a ""shortcut"" package to do stuff fast. Before doing things fast I need to know what I am doing! Finally, the quizzes and assignments are completely disconnected from the courses.The worst course I have ever taken on coursera.",1
94253,It's a great course but I hope you add a few things. The course about the machine learning algorithm is so basic. Please get deep into the machine learning algorithm. Then it would become the perfect course.,4
94254,Good enough to open up mind of researcher,3
94255,"This is a part of the data specialization; from afar, I would not be interested in Machine Learning because of this course. I will seek other methods to learn.",2
94256,"Exercises could be more complete, and some are outdated for latest R, giving slightly different results.",3
94257,Fair but assignments are not very well explained,3
94258,Nice Course for every New candidate,4
94259,One of my favorites in the series! What I have been waiting for building up the prerequisite knowledge. Enjoy the instructor!,5
94260,Excellent course for beginner.,5
94261,"Was pretty good, but quite short and some assignments did not align as well with the lecture material as they could have.",4
94262,Lectures are too complicated. I understand that material is not easy and one should do a lot of research and reading to understand the essence of the taught algorithms but the lecturer is also not very helpful and assignments are everywhere on the internet which nobody needs to get tired of thinking a little to do the homework as their product.,3
94263,Unexpectedly challenging and insightful.,5
94264,Quizzes are useful exercises but need to do a lot of self studying.,3
94265,"Rather basic, nevertheless a good introduction to the topic of machine learning with R. Mostly concentrated on applications of the R caret package.",4
94266,"Fun course, also practical and useful",5
94267,"great!!! In this lecture, I learn how to write R code to analyze data with Machine learning methods.",5
94268,"Nice course, Gives a god insight on what can me done with R and Predictions",4
94269,Excellent introductory course to Machine Learning. Very informative materials. Prof. Leek is a great teacher.,5
94270,The machine learning course every Data Scientist should do.,5
94271,"Great course, very demanding, but it could use more reading material, ebooks instead of links on video.",4
94272,"Unlike the rest of the modules in this specialisation, this one was well taught, a good blend of theory and practice and well paced.There were still a few issues with wording in quizzes (and some where there seemed to be two identical answers to one question, where one would be considered right and the other wrong - purely chance). In addition, the lack of consistency in how to submit assignments across the specialisation is frustrating, I'm not sure if it's supposed to be a way to show how to use github or something like that, but it shouldn't be the case.",4
94273,needs more case studies and examples,2
94274,"It's very cookbook driven - it's not a deep dive into the topics. This can be dangerous: a little knowledge and all that. However references for more are provided. If you can imitate the coding examples, you should be OK for the assignments. Fair warning: the quizzes are hard to replicate unless you set up your environment to mirror exactly the version of the packages used in the course.",4
94275,"Very enjoyable and generally quite understandable introduction to machine learnings with hands-on approach through the course project. It was a bit too fast-paced and generic for my liking, but many options were offered and highlighted for finding additional learning documents and courses to be able to deepen the knowledge acquired in this course.",4
94276,Great topic with a great instructor. Only wish the program was a little longer to spend some more time on some of the models.,5
94277,A good introduction to machine learning.,5
94278,"I learned a lot in this class. There are slight gaps from the depth of material covered in the lectures to the quizzes and assignment. If you're good at researching online, you'll be fine.",4
94279,"It's hard as hell, and very good.",5
94280,Just the right level of detail,4
94281,"Good course for learning the basics of the caret package. However, it is not a good course for learning machine learning.",3
94282,"too general no depth, not recommended for science or engineering degree holders",1
94283,Awesome course giving a practical experience of a Data Scientist.Perfect place to get your hands dirty! :),5
94284,Great primer for machine learning with ample additional resources for those who are interested. I feel this course gave me a solid basis to delve deeper into the topic.,5
94285,To be honest I don't think this is worth the money.,1
94286,Great and Excellent thoughts and course material.,5
94287,"Very good content for beginner, lot of learning in machine learning special caret package in R.",5
94288,great course,5
94289,Extremely useful class! Jeff also has many excellent suggestions for resources that will teach you even more about machine learning.,5
94290,introduces lot of machine learning techniques which are used by practitioners !,4
94291,This course allows you to implement practical solutions using machine learning algorithms without having to know the mechanisms behind the calculations in detail. Unfortunately questions in the discussion forum were quite rare and many questions were not resolved during this course.,4
94292,A very good course.,5
94293,"Great course, very high paced with a lot of information. would have been great to add two more weeks and another project to use more machine learning",4
94294,Fantastic class!,5
94295,In my opinion this course is highly technical and demanding in nature compared with the others. The learning experience is good and coursera.org has given a opportunity for customization ! thank you Coursera,4
94296,Great course. I really enjoyed working on the prediction project at the end.,5
94297,"Good material, presented in an organized fashion. I was able to apply what I learned immediately in a work setting.",5
94298,Title says everything. Practically and basically no theory explained. Good course though.,4
94299,"The course is really great, however it should last a little longer, 4 weeks is hard to accomplish",4
94300,Nice learning course,5
94301,Awesome Course !!,5
94302,Very informative course.,4
94303,too easy,3
94304,One of the most valuable courses in the specialization!,5
94305,good and useful!,5
94306,"As as standalone course on machine learning, it's probably best to take Andrew Ng's class on Coursera. This course mostly teaches the basic usage of the caret package. It is too short to cover more fundamental topics in machine learning, like how to choose an algorithm based on the problem and the data.I took this class just because I was engaged in the Data Science specialization. I wanted to clear the Capstone project and get the Data Science specialization certificate.",3
94307,"I saw two main issues with this course: 1) dated lecture videos, oftentimes with R code that can't be replicated using up-to-date packages, and 2) lack of thoughtful design: example after example after example after example doesn't really teach you anything.",2
94308,Felt difficult in understanding the overall course in short duration . 1 month is not enough for this course. I request the authors to make the course much more simpler,2
94309,"I enjoyed a lot this module, I'll use at my daily work some of the features I learned",5
94310,Excellent introduction to machine learning. I feel that I have a good basic foundation to start building upon.,5
94311,johns hopkins' courses very helped me,5
94312,In my view the course was useful but not as good as the previus ones I followed in the specializacion (such as regression models and stat. inference).The subject was too broad and there was no space to cover in detail all the algorithms. Also I think it's a bit out of date because there is no references to xgbboost which is now dominating many Kaggle contests,3
94313,Very little depth. I don't recommend this if you don't already have background in statistics or R. I really didn't learn anything. I mostly just gamed the quizzes and projects.,1
94314,This is a very useful course in Machine Learning that teaches us how to use the R based packages such as CARET for applying machine learning techniques. The course project helps understand how these techniques are applied in real world applications and develop useful insights.,5
94315,Course content feels upside down. You'll learn about machine algorithm specifics and caveats before anyone explains what the said algorithm actually hopes to achieve.,2
94316,"The course feels rushed. I understand teaching Machine Learning in 4 weeks is impossible, but then maybe the course needs to have a narrower yet deeper scope rather than throw at you many concepts without details. e.g. trees, random forests, bagging and boosting all in 10 minutes each? Impossible...So, as opposed to creating machine learning intuition I feel the course became an R package code book.",3
94317,"The lectures were great and engaging. I felt like they went too fast. Jeff says at the beginning that this is just an overview and points to some other resources. As an overview, this class works well. You can expect to learn a bit about what machine learning is and how to to do it using the caret package in R.",4
94318,"Of all the JHU Data Science specialization courses I've had, this was by far the most enjoyable. I really liked how the class was more in the style of 'here's some techniques, now do whatever you want on the project.' Prior courses are, and understandably so, more constrained in the assignments. It's not until here that the student really has the tools to be able to flex their analytical muscles, and it pays off.Also, of the three instructors, I am most favorable to Jeff Leek, who teaches this class. He communicates much clearer than Roger Peng or Brian Caffo. I find I learn more from his content than the others.Lastly, I will say that this class doesn't hold a torch to University of Washington's Machine Learning specialization. That's expected since this is one class and that's a whole series of classes. If you're hungry for more after this one, I highly recommend UWash's Machine Learning specialization.",4
94319,I really enjoyed this course. The material was concise and allows me to get up and running with ML.,5
94320,Good overview of available techniques and the Caret package. Will get you started in machine learning.,4
94321,"The quizes do not match a 100% with the lecture videos. There are some weird questions. My algorithms' outputs deviate from answers some times, which is due to different software versions. Quizes are not very educating this time. Courses by Brian Caffo were much better.",3
94322,"Hands-on training, practical introduction to machine learning using R!",5
94323,I like the organisation of the course. The first video is so informative yet so simple. Great resources have been listed in it and so subtly. Also I saw the organization of folders and lecture notes and everything in Github repo for this course. It s awesome. I keep stuff like that.. well numbered and everything. I really appreciate it as it makes life of a student lot easier. Thanks.,5
94324,"Material is very high level. No ppt's are given, so all links presented in the video's cannot be viewed.Quizzes are based upon old packages, so incorrect answers are provided.No replies at discussion board from TA""s or instructors.",1
94325,Principle and practices. Good coverage on topics to get you started!,5
94326,"Nice, other courses will go more in depth though.",4
94327,"With this course, you can develop an important skill for the final steps of a data science project.",5
94328,"Great Course, will be nice to have more projects to see how it goes with different data",4
94329,"I liked the course and found it informative, but wish there were more stuff on unsupervised learning neural network algorithms (SOMs). Learning about most used algos are great, but would also like to know other machine learning algos that are used concurrently.",4
94330,"Useful course that is very practical in teaching tools in R that enable Machine learning. This course is, however, not suitable for people who want to learn theoretical machine learning. For that, learners will find Machine Learning by Andrew Ng a better alternative. However, if you're interested in machine learning packages in R and how to implement them, this course achieves that purpose for you.",5
94331,Very practical and goal-oriented,5
94332,"I want to learn ML in R so I go straight to this course without taking any other course in this specialization, and it doesn't disappoint me. Thanks for a great course!",5
94333,Really Well Structured Course!!,4
94334,Very informative,5
94335,"Good introduction to machine learning, might suffer a bit from trying to cover too much ground in such a short time.",4
94336,The mathematics in this course are at a high level (similar to Statistical Inference) - and are presented at a pace that is challenging without significant background in the field. There is little guidance presented on the methods required. It is recommended that students source out plenty of support material (intro to statistical inference and similar).,2
94337,High level and brief overview but found it informative introduction into machine learning with R. The final project is fun and interesting.,5
94338,"Cannot take the exam, I have to pay... wtf... I will probably pay at the end, but I want to take the class first. Without certificate I cannot prove I took the course.",1
94339,Love it.,5
94340,"Absolutely useless random un-explained list of facts and advices that is thrown to a learner without any attempt to give a systematic approach. Pure waste of time and effort. Can only be suitable to those, who already know the subject well and can use some additional facts that are randomly presented in this ""course"".",2
94341,Very practical tools and also very encouraging!!,5
94342,The instructions for the final project were very unclear and even though I submitted all assignments well before their respective deadlines and reviewed the required number of projects my work was not processed for a grade thereby delaying my specialization completion.,2
94343,Compared to previous two courses in specialization this one is far worse - it is more of excursion into used methods than actual learning using any of mentioned methods in enough detail to be able to do meaningful analyses.,3
94344,"Some of the terms used here vary from the terms used in the industry. For example recall, precision etc. Overall this is a very good course with provides basics of machine learning.",5
94345,"Pretty good overview of how to build some types of machine learning models through the caret library in R, but not much in terms of the theoretical underpinnings or why one method is better than the other or where it is most suitable.",4
94346,"This was a very good introduction to machine learning and how to use machine learning packages in R. It would have been better if the class had been longer than four weeks, but I learned a lot for the length of the course.",5
94347,Fast paced and little focused on the algorithms but quite useful overall.,4
94348,Excellent course with great didactic. Congratulations!,5
94349,Great introduction with a broad set of tools and plenty of resources for more in depth study.,5
94350,"If you have taken Andrew Ng's machine learning class, it's not necessary to take this one.",3
94351,Great introduction to the subject with good classification examples using R.,5
94352,Thank you son much!!!!I really like the course.It help me in my job =),5
94353,Really good class. I think there were some small issues with the class project. Like all real world problems it was not entirely well specified and the data was a bit odd to use for a prediction exercise because it was time series data.,5
94354,A good course where you can learn how ML algorithms work practically.,4
94355,"Made many things clear. Perhaps, the best class in the series.",5
94356,"A great Course, my favorite into the Data Science Specialization",5
94357,Enjoyed without reservation,5
94358,This is by far the most enlightening class in the whole specialization. I really got a good handle about how to build a predictive model and apply it to real datasets.,5
94359,Very good course. I am very knew to this topic but am sure will find a lot of application in my speciality - geophysics,4
94360,"Project description versus requirements were terrible, not sure if the new Coursera format played a role in the issues or not. Quite a few of the homework items require guessing as the answers don't align to the results of the latest tools they have you use. If the first class or three in the series was like this I wouldn't have taken the courses.",1
94361,This is too high level for a machine learning course. You don't exactly learn a lot about the techniques just how to use them and name them out if you're having a conversation with a person. My least favorite course in the series,2
94362,"The course gives a clear explanation of why machine learning, with a goal of prediction, is different from regression. The use of the caret package in R is emphasized. Caret provides a uniform interface to many different machine learning algorithms, leaving no excuse for practitioners not to test a variety of approaches to confirm the robustness of their conclusions.",5
94363,"Had big expectations for this one... really one of the ones to look forward to after working through the beginning of the specialization, but for some reason, it seemed any prof or even TA interaction was absent this time around like in none of the other specialization coursed to date. Bugs in the new interface and quizzes weren't really addressed. Couldn't even get an official response about the apparent removal of Distinction-level now (which I'd been working to get in all specialization courses and now seems no longer an option). Still interesting content. As a ""free"" course, it's still really valuable. As one of the people that paid for this and all others in this specialization, this is the one I felt didn't return as much value to justify the payment with no ""official"" course staff seeming to be involved this round.",2
94364,incomplete and not clear. extremely disappointed.,2
94365,the lack of assisted practices made it harder to digest the contents and methodologies.strongly suggest to develop some practice problems with explanations.,3
94366,"Poor compared with some of the others on this specialisation. The lectures are too fast and high level, with no allowance given for people who are unfamiliar with this area and attempting to learn it.",1
94367,"Wish to have more systematic structure, detail information and hands-on exercises.",4
94368,"I'm somewhat disappointed. I attend almost all other courses in this specialization (except of ""data product"") and this one is, on my opinion, the weakest one. A lot of links to useful information though. This is more reference guide rather than a real training course.I can say even more, initially I start other courses of this specialization just because they were marked as strong prerequisite to this one. For now, I think all other courses of the specialization were much more valuable for me than this one.I've also took Andrew Ng course on Machine Learning in the past, and my learning experience was much better. In lectures on some concepts (like regularization) I'm pretty sure I would not understand anything if I had not been familiar with the subject before..",3
94369,"Class materials and videos are confusing and do not go into enough detail. Assignments require a lot of search of extra information outside course materials. Also, the length that is needed to complete the assignments vary widely week to week.",3
94370,"Great practical whirlwind tour. Light on theory, however, but it's a good entry point to the field. Thumbs up!",5
94371,"Too much surface, not enough depth.",1
94372,"First and foremost I'm so thankful for the exposure to so much material in such a condensed schedule. Very good class. Even though I had to muscle my way through it.I think the class could be improved with one additional discussion thread for the project.A guide similar to the ones created for Inferential Statistics and Regression would also have been very helpful.I benefited immensely from reading parts of the book ""An Introduction to Statistical Learning"" while taking this course.",4
94373,"Does not give much intuition around the subject. I found the lectures a bit uninspiring. Lots of powerpoint (just text, no images or visuals really) and the lecturer just underlined the words he was talking about as he read the powerpoint out. I found the Udacity Intro to Machine Learning course gave a much better intuition and understanding of this subject. We also had slides on how to split data into a training and testing set on pretty much EVERY lecture - what a waste of time!",2
94374,Great course. Really educational and informative. Well taught too!,5
94375,more needs to be taught in class. what is taught is not sufficient for quizzes.,3
94376,"lecture can be really unclear sometimes because lecturer breezes through the actual implementation of training/predicting: ""use x, y, and z [underlines some stuff on screen]"" and you're doneAlso lots of mistakes/typos in lecture and quizzes",2
94377,"I believe this course is critical and much needed given where the Industry is heading. Prof Leek, has tried his best to explain the concepts in a lucid manner, however the complexity of the content, may challenge most students.A few more examples with R code would have been helpful as translating problem statement to R code may not be intuitive.I would highly recommend that students should plan to study some advance statistics before attempting this course. Having said that, i think this is a wonderful starter course to get a glimpse of what Machine Learning is all about.",3
94378,Really good overview of machine learning techniques and model evaluation.,4
94379,"Thank you for inviting me to be a beta tester for Practical Machine Learning. I completed this course at the beginning of October of this year. When I was asked to be a ""beta tester"" I thought that I would be presented with new materials. However, the only thing that has changed is the look and layout of the Coursera web pages. The video lectures, quizzes, and assignment are the same as they have been for quite some time. Here are some specific comments:1. The video lectures: To me, these are clear and easy to follow. However, like those in the other courses in the Data Science Specialization, this course covers a wide range of subjects but tends not to have much depth. When I compare this and other courses in the specialization to other moocs that I have taken including Machine Learning with Andrew Ng and the Stanford Online EdX Course Statistical Learning with Trevor Hastie and Rob Tibshirani, the somewhat cursory treatment of the topics in the Data Science Specialization becomes more noticeable. Perhaps in the interest of ""truth in advertising"" this course should be called ""A Brief Introduction to Practical Machine Learning."" In the interest of full disclosure, I should note that I have an undergraduate degree in economics and an MS and PhD in psychology with a quantitative bent. I have had lots of statistics courses, especially those related to ANOVA, MANOVA, nonparametric statistics, correlation and regression methods, and structural equation modeling. The latter is important in psychology because researchers in this field like to measure latent variables. I had been an analyst using SPSS for several decades and the courses in this specialization helped me to migrate to R. Also, there have been may new developments that have become more accessible through R packages (like the fancier tree methods) that were not available when I completed my PhD. Thus these courses (and others such as the ones by Ng and Hastie and Tibshirani) have helped me to keep abreast of these developments. So they are good for me, but I wonder to what degree do the courses in the Data Science Specialization actually make a person a ""data scientist?""2. The quizzes: I think these items are good practice and are at a reasonable level of difficulty. However, these items are the same ones that you have been giving for quite some time, with perhaps a few new ones added. A little googling will lead you to the answers to these quizzes posted online. I recommend that you put a little time and effort into writing all new items.3. The final project: Again, this project is good practice and seems to be at a reasonable level of difficulty. And again, this is the same project that appears to have been given at the end of numerous iterations of this course. And again, numerous write-ups for this project can be found online. And again, I would recommend that you put a little time and effort into finding a new data set for people to analyze. This would help minimize some of the rampant cheating that I found in this and in other classes in the specialization.On the subject of cheating, when I was doing the peer grading for the courses in the Specialization, I would enter the code of the students that I was grading into the Google search box and all too often I found links to submissions for the project by students who had taken earlier sessions of the class. That is, students were copying these earlier submissions by other students and submitting them as their own. And I don't mean that they were similar: students were copying other people's work line by line, character by character. I found that to be quite irritating and I always reported it to Coursera. Of course, if the instructors would change their assignments once I a while, then this sort of copying would be impossible. As it is, it appears that the good professors put a lot of time and effort into creating what are indeed a worthwhile set of classes. However, after they created the classes, they seem to have pushed the ""autopilot"" button and gone off to do their day jobs. I would suggest that re-engaging with these courses and reading some of the comments that other students have made would be helpful.Overall, I appreciate the courses in the Data Science Specialization and specifically this course. I know that these class materials took considerable time and efforts to create. I wish the instructors continued success with these classes.",4
94380,A good introductory course for people who has an interest in knowing the principles of machine learning and want to make a step forward. Sufficient details covered throughout the course and additional resources were provided which are very useful. Quizzes were well designed with minor improvements in the accidental mismatch of the answers due to package version issues. Overall the study experience was enjoyable and would definitely recommend to someone who wants to start knowing data science.,4
94381,"Feels like everything is solved using a caret package, while the back-end theory is only slightly touched. By using a single line command solver, student may lack the foundation for harder problems in the real world.",3
94382,I think this is the best course I have ever came across in the coursera. Everything is discussed in the most simple manner with great depth.,5
94383,Massive Improvement on delivery compared to course 6. I would suggest to take the t,4
94384,Some lab work (swirl()) did not match the material presentation order. Essential coursework delivered at a blistering pace. Good Stuff.,4
94385,good course,4
94386,Very Good Course !,5
94387,"With the first few videos, I was concerned I would be re-living the nightmare that was the Statistical Inference course. (I gave a long review of that one. To summarize Statistical Inference: I hated it. But I learned things. Those things stuck. I used them in real life. That's good.)But wow, after getting through this course, I loved it. Very practical and useful stuff. It had me thirsting for more information and I found myself reading unassigned material. I became particularly interested in Anova and continuing to read up on it even though I am done the course.I would take this course again. I would recommend it to those wanting to learn more about data science. It's got some quirks and room for improvement, but overall it's a good course.",5
94388,"Great course, although feeling as always a bit rushed on the last lectures. At least it makes you want to investigate more about the subject.I find frustrating however not to have a proper instructor example of the final assignment, it is hard to review other participants work and realize what they / you have done wrong without actually knowing how best the assignment should have been fulfilled.And as all courses in this specialization, there is not much interaction between participants, and not much effort by mentors to animate it",4
94389,"Slightly better than the Statistical Inference course, but many of the same technical and delivery defects persist. With an otherwise high quality program, I recommend re-producing the inference and regression lectures to increase the overall value of the curriculum.",2
94390,2 thumbs up,4
94391,Quite a lot of material to cover in such a short time!,3
94392,"Good course on the theories behind regression, followed by significant applications and how to use them in R. Lectures are very dry, but the information within them is very useful.",5
94393,Great introduction to regression models. Pretty clear,4
94394,"The concepts are well explained and precise. I think it depends on the individual to dive deeper into the topic by independent learning. Good data examples. Also following the suggested book of the author helps with some extra excercises. However , I feel extra practice questions would help .",4
94395,"Good foundation in the Data Science Certification for Practical Machine Learning. There are 3 areas that I would like to dig deeper so far: Statistical Inference, Regression Models and Practical Machine Learning (perhaps + Deep Learning).",5
94396,Lots of material needs additional study (from different sources) as it's only summarily explained. Much math without the link to the praxis :-(,3
94397,Very Challenging CourseVery well presentedGreat material/source of information for studyLoved It !,5
94398,"In-depth and detailed, this one month course will provide aspirants with the knowledge and skills required to conduct efficient regressions.",5
94399,"Once again an excellent course, thank you!",5
94400,"A very intense course, where a lot of concepts are introduced. In order for all the new information to be metabolized, it took me much more than four weeks.",5
94401,"This course has been the most difficult in the Dara Science track so far, but you get a more in depth knowledge in data analysis and interpretation based on statistical models.",5
94402,"This course was an improvement in teaching modality from the statistical inference course, with more polished content, but the link between the lectures and the actual exercises was still a bit strained. Overall, it felt like there was a bit of a disconnect between the swirl exercises and the lectures, and this led to a lot of self-teaching.",4
94403,Many things are not clear enough in multivariable regression part.,3
94404,"Amazing course, I learnt a lot.",5
94405,Very good material but often too fragmentend/messy. The notes would need re-writing.,4
94406,"This course is great, if you want to get into it. This was the first time I have been exposed to linear and generalized linear regression. I was overwhelmed by so much information and knowledge that I needed extra time to understand and to bring the pieces from week 1 to week 4 together.The peer reviews weren't (in my case) not very helpful. I missed concrete feedback on my approach and the result. I would have appreciated some kind of assurance that the achieved results are of quality and on the level of data scientist.",5
94407,"Important material, poorly taught.",1
94408,Great Course,5
94409,Content regarding variable selection is kind of rough.,4
94410,"Excellent course, but you have to use other materials from different courses as well.",5
94411,Very good course.,5
94412,I really enjoyed this course. I think the toughest for a newbie like me was the second course R programming. But the following courses including this one flow very well and are easy to follow with real life examples. It does get easier after the second course,5
94413,A little monotonous sometimes. Otherwise good.,4
94414,"This course is great, instructor is good, however, the material of this course is not well organized, even the swirl practice is not put in the correct week, not in the same pace as the lectures. The quiz and project are far much easier than lecture content.",3
94415,To fast pace and missing lot of content to make this lesson enjoyable!!!,2
94416,great courses!!! very practical but no a lot of mathemetics,5
94417,This is a great course. The content clearly explains the regression model.,4
94418,Very Nice!,5
94419,"This was better than the statistical inference course, but Brian still puts too much emphasis on the precision of his language (as if he's teaching to other mathematicians) which makes it difficult to understand. I would like to see a bit more dumbed down explanation of the mathematics in the examples (similar to Sal at Khan Academy). If that happened, this would definitely be a 5 star course.",4
94420,"Very interesting course, yet course content could be spread more evenly (week 4 is really a lot)",3
94421,Was tough but thoroughly had fun completing it. Its a cleverly designed course.,5
94422,"This course is much improved, when compared with Statistical Inference. The instructor have put much effort in making the lectures interesting and casual, at the same time not loosing the value of contents. I especially liked some subtle jokes - just a finishing human touch.Some lectures from 4th week were not very well rehearser and shot hastily. Some quiz question were disproportionately difficult, but most of material is covered in course or course materials. Otherwise the course is very educational.",4
94423,Hard but rewarding work that I think is perfect for Data Science.,5
94424,"I was hoping to learn about PROBIT models. I know they are very similar to LOGIT ones, but still... the pace is a little bit too fast and I think it requires more time than what it says.",4
94425,A well defined learning path to understand the fundation of machine learning techniques.,5
94426,"Great ressources. Usefull presentations, maybe too rich for a newbie.It was too fast for me. Could be done in 2x more time :/",5
94427,good review of the fundamentals,5
94428,Learned a lot,5
94429,Great course.,5
94430,Excellent - thanks!,5
94431,Excellent course. Might be difficult to get full value of information without prior exposure/background.,5
94432,Very practical/hands-on intro to regression models. You will definitely be able to apply those methods after this course whenever you need them.,5
94433,"Regression models was almost just as difficult as statistical inference. Again, the swirls and exercises were of great help. The pace, as always, was quite fast, but in the end all the pieces fitted together. Congratulations on a job well done!",4
94434,"Like the way the Prof uses media. This is a very light touch on a very deep subject so it has to balance analytical work with the light ""trust me and just do it"" approach. The balance was mostly there although on a couple items I don't know that I had a good enough grip to know what I don't know.",4
94435,Good course! Prof Caffo is very clear in his explanations!,5
94436,Something was missing from this course. I cam away with an increased understanding of regression but I still feel like I struggle with many concepts and had to put in much more time than the recommended.Still when I found the answer it was all still contained and maybe the material itself is just advanced.my 2c,4
94437,"Requires much more than a month to digest the material and complete the assignments. A default/initial one-week offering is too tight unless you are only taking the course (not working). I know one can complete the course in more than a single round and I did that but I still don't think the expectations should be set for a single month.Instruction (video content) can be much better, at least compared to a lot of other courses on Coursera.",3
94438,Not worth it for the bucks.Instructor has tried his best to make no sense of the subject.I would be happy for a refund.,1
94439,My name is Jose Antonio from Brazil. I am looking for a new Data Scientist career (https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseantonio11)I did this course to get new knowledge about Data Science and better understand the technology and your practical applications.The course was excellent and the classes well taught by teachers.Congratulations to Coursera team and Instructors,5
94440,Very good course,5
94441,Love the whole course approach on the importance of linear models and how one should interpret them to get a better grasp of the data one possesses - one should definitely take the statistical inference course before attempting this course beforehand.,5
94442,Very helpful!,5
94443,great introduction to regression models,5
94444,This course failed greatly to balance the workload by week. The third week which I think was the most important one have too many information to learn and assimilate whereas the first two weeks could be rearranged to start multivariate regression earlier. Another proof of week 3 issue: the related swirl exercises start in week2 (2 of them) and finish in week4 (2 more exercises) !!!!!I think one of the most important expertise and knowledge that a data scientist must know and master was unfairly squeezed in one week leaving no time for the learner/student to do more search/exercises on the subject.,2
94445,"Great course. The content might be improved to be more clear. I feel that sometimes the instructor assumes we are familiar with some concepts we have not seen in previous courses. Also, some times he does a very good job explaining the WHY before the HOW, and some other times he does not. Very knowledgeable instructor.",4
94446,"I am no used to this educational system so I find difficult to follow without any proof or demonstration of the mathematical tools. I find proofs necessary for a good understanding of concepts. Another benefit of proof will be to have a more rigorous framework for variable names in the explanations. Even though this is more a practical course, it will benefit from being a bit more rigorous ; so at least people can make proofs on they own.Other than that, it is a great course. Very practical and to the point.",3
94447,nice and practical class! I think if provide some recommend reading may create more deeper insight in regression,5
94448,prerequisites are very mandatory to do this course,4
94449,"Great course to learn various regression models and ""R"" tools to implement them efficiently, butwas little hard to keep with the deadline.",4
94450,"Sometimes videos were hard to understand, especially in week 3.",4
94451,"I enjoyed the earlier courses more. I did not like the way the materials were provided. There were a lot of very complex ideas were presented, in a very concise and brief manner. Also, there should be more exercises to practice. May be its me, but, I guess, I might need more time to fully comprehend the materials.",3
94452,"To me, this is by far the best course in the series. It deals with the scientific foundation of how to do data science: regression models, residuals, measures of the quality of the prediction, etc. The teacher is clearly a mathematician and has an academic style of presenting. He is very clear and chooses the subject in a clever way. One always understands what he or she is doing.Highly recommended. It doesn't get five stars only because it covers only the basics; I would have really liked it to last twice as much!",4
94453,Very well thought-out!,5
94454,Everything you need to know to have a clear understanding of regression models and learn how to use their basic functions in R.,5
94455,Excellent overview of a very broad and complex topic with plenty of useful applications within R. The course project does an outstanding job at teaching the pitfalls of omitted variable bias.,5
94456,"I again found many of the lectures to be difficult to follow along, there seems to be lots of different styles of videos in the way that the person was superimposed on the slides. In fact it was often impossible to read the text in the slide due to the size of the presenters head which obscured the text. Honestly this data science course is getting worse as the months progress, you really should think of updating the content of the course if you want to continue to charge money for it. 2 stars as I did actually learn something despite the quality of the material and its delivery.",2
94457,It is a good course for learning regression model implementation in R. You may need to have a basic understanding of popular regression models like linear & logistic as the course doesn't cover mathematical aspects in detail,4
94458,I really learned some useful knowledge and codes from this course!,5
94459,the lecture notes is a bit confusing,3
94460,"Extremely useful and exciting. Everything from previous modules fall in places and you may see some practical implementations from the course. By the way R is awesome!Many thanks to faculty, you do a great job.",5
94461,Great - learned a bunch,5
94462,"I was really disappointed with this course. I took the other courses from Brian Caffo and truly enjoyed them. For the previous courses, I've always used the books and they helped me tremendously to be able to comprehend the material. There is a book for Regression Models but but it's a real mess. It feels like a draft that no one cared to take a second look. There is a bunch of wrong code and typos. The explanation doesn't go as far as it should. I had to resort to many different sources just to be able to get by the course. I hope the instructors review this course soon because it does not have the same quality as others. If they don't review it, don't bother paying for it. Try learning Regression Models elsewhere.",1
94463,"With all respect, Professor, if you are reading all our comments, I think you are a really smart person and you should take all the negative feedback from your students here, positively and constructively. As having good knowledge will never be equals to able to produce good students. Personally, I feel that you should lower down yourself and speak to the level of your students/audience. Use more simple examples, draw a big picture in our minds on what is this course all about, what are we going to achieve, in each of the topics, what are we going to look at and what methods available.For foundation class like this, I think few simple examples and introducing one or two useful methods in each topic would be more than sufficient to us. The objective should be providing us with the basic knowledge, get us interested in this subject, and able to apply those well taught basic knowledge. As when we are interested, for sure we will go and do more research, and some might even would like to move on to intermediate or advance levels.The key point here is ""speak to the level of your audience"". Even if you are able to talk everything above the sky and up to the moon. If no one able to understand you, it is useless.",2
94464,"Given the importance of this subject, this course should have been split in two or more or have a longer duration to properly address subjects as GLM or model selection techniques.",3
94465,Good course. My only negative remark is that I really missed the swirl exercises that were available for the other courses of this specialization.,4
94466,The course is essentially just a review of formulas with very little intuition explained to the beginner. It was necessary to use a collection of outside material from other courses and readings to learn the concepts. This course needs to be completely redone with a focus on developing a student's intuition for the material and then support this intuition with basic examples that build as the course progresses. A fundamental demonstration of how to use R to work through regression models (starting from square one) should be added so that this becomes a self-contained course. As it currently stands it is a collection of poorly integrated slides and concepts that serve to confuse the student more than educate. Other classes teach this material infinitely better.,1
94467,"The level of this course is a lot higher than the other courses. The course contains a lot of material and exercises which makes it hard to finish the course within the time period of one month. Nevertheless did I like Brian's way of teaching. He's a perfectionist and takes his time to explain everything in detail. I really liked the challenge, 5 stars.",5
94468,Outstanding material with different levels of difficulty and depth on the subject. Great source material.,5
94469,very concise and well taught,5
94470,"Difficult, fast peaced and not well explained. Requires a lot of work.",2
94471,"It's a great course and tought very well. It required effort, you apply many of previously teach concept and requires a lot of excercise",5
94472,Great course about the undelying statistical mechanisms of regression models.,5
94473,Interesting and important course!I don't think this course is suitable for beginners. You need to know this stuff before you take the course. Works well as a refresher.,5
94474,Very informative and detailed explanation of how regression model works!,5
94475,The video lectures are really boring and useless,2
94476,Great course!,5
94477,very usful,5
94478,"Very concise and good structured course. The new videos are much better than the old ones! Thank you Brian Caffo! However in the discussion forum you find less posts than in the previous format, which is a pitty.",5
94479,Fantastic course with great visualizations,5
94480,I had a lot of fun in this course. The exercises in the text and quizzes help me understand the concepts,5
94481,To be honest I don't think this is worth the money.,1
94482,Advance topic in regression model.,4
94483,recommend to others too,5
94484,Great and Excellent thoughts and course material.,5
94485,"This course gives a very thorough and rigorous treatment to the topic of regression models.It teaches you how to derive from the ground, how regression models are made and how to interpret every information available through regression models.Although the lectures are very lengthy and dry, the course offers a very rich well of information that is not readily available else where.Thanks to Brian Caffo for the wealth of information about regression models taught through this course!",5
94486,I learnt regression models from this course.,5
94487,Great course.,4
94488,"Content and quizz are not aligned.Mentors answer to 0% of the forum posts.Poor student community.Do not pay for this course, just follow the swirl and/or get some tuto about regressions.",1
94489,Should cover a lot of dfificuties when the model assumptions are violated and should be for a longer time or having a second course about this theme.,2
94490,"The professor doesn't explain clearly as part of the videos is his correcting himself or saying the same thing two or three times. And why must the videos show the teacher? It distracts from the slides and seeing him move doesn't help understand anything betterConcepts like VIF or hat values are not very well explained by the teacher, at least the SWIRL lesson explains it correctly. ANOVA and ANCOVA are mentioned in the description but they aren't explained anywhere. ANOVA is used without any explanation of what it is.I found myself searching online for other sources to understand the concepts.",2
94491,Great!,5
94492,"This course will give you a good basic foundation in regression models. However, do be prepared to do a good amount of work besides just viewing the videos. I would recommend at the very least to go through the exercises in the 'recommended textbook' to gain a better understanding.",4
94493,"The course is good. Unlike the previous courses I took in this track, there was almost no interaction in the forums and also no-one to give feedback. I wonder if there were any TA's present in this run.",3
94494,"Some topics that are important, are obviated",2
94495,"I like this course a lot because it solidified my understanding of regression. I have often read about regression when reading scientific articles however, i never took the time to really investigate the mechanics on how it is done. Thanks to this course i can now appreciate better the journals that i read. Furthermore, the course project for this course was quite interesting, not too hard, and was bit challenging. There was plenty of time to finish the project and some extra time to make it even better than a simple submission that meets the basic requirements of the course. Thanks to the my classmates and the nice people in Coursera and R, i had a great time learning during this course.",5
94496,"This course is better than Statistical Inference, and I think it is as useful. Non credit excersise are still very good at helping with understanding in practice what is going on.",3
94497,Very intuitive course,4
94498,Coursera keeps changing my rating. Not cool.,2
94499,"Videos were very difficult to follow along with. Overall, I learned a good amount though.",4
94500,Very little depth. I don't recommend this if you don't already have background in statistics or R. I really didn't learn anything. I mostly just gamed the quizzes and projects.,1
94501,"concise, practical and straight forward",5
94502,"I found the videos tough to watch. I was hoping for something that would be more practical for non-statisticians, but the lectures mainly devolved into mathematical proofs. That said, I did learn some from this class. Just not as much as I'd hoped.",3
94503,"This is a decent class, covering linear regression and a few of its variants in good detail. It's a challenging subject, but presented acceptably here.",3
94504,The instructor is at time incomprehensible. It would be helpful to speak more slowly and pause more often. Otherwise he sounds like repeating something that he's so well memorized after many years of teaching.,3
94505,easy to understand and full of new idea about using R.especially 'manipulate' package is very useful,5
94506,"This course is the first one in the Data Science series to lapse in terms of the clarity of the lectures, and the sense of cohesiveness of the material. Brian Caffo's lectures in Statistical Inference were good; in this course they seem to veer left and right rather than get straight to the essence of whatever subject he is lecturing about.A more structured final project would have been helpful. The instructions on this project weren't quite so blunt as to say ""Take this data set, do some regression-y stuff and come back with something about these two variables,"" but that's basically as far as our instructions went. It could have been a great learning experience to have a more detailed guide through the construction of a regression analysis, but instead an assignment which was 40% of our grade was put together as an afterthought. It was the assignment equivalent of stopping in the 7-11 a block away from a birthday party to buy a card.Also, in terms of delivering the content: Mr. Caffo needs to structure his slide/video arrangements so that he is not standing in front of the text. Think of it from the point of view of somebody wanting to listen and read at the same time.",2
94507,The instructor is not good and doesn't explain things clearly.,2
94508,"The material presented was of course useful, but I never really felt like I understood how it all tied together, or what the big picture was. I think that some case studies that show how all of the concepts relate to one another, or how they are used in the bigger picture would be helpful.Also, as a suggestion, I feel that if something is important enough to be included in the quiz, it merits more than the briefest of mentions in the lecture.",3
94509,I loved studying Regression Models taught by Prof. Brian Caffo. I think these are very important techniques that I will be able to use for my research and analysis.I found the teaching to be very in depth in explaining various aspects of regression model development.,5
94510,"Not the easiest course, but very rewarding if you hang in there. The material is very well explained with ample examples.",5
94511,A very well organized course with nice simple explanations and introductions into the world of regression models,5
94512,Very difficult. Needs homework problems guided by videos like Statistical Inference coarse to make easier.,2
94513,I think this course needs more emphasis on practical applications and less mathematical background.,3
94514,"Overall okay course but the lectures are too focused on theory with some applications to the real world. I think this course needs to be reconfigured and taught from an applied focus instead of 30% applied 70% theory.Also the new format is horrible and TAs are nonexistent as are discussions in general on the forums now. The TAs were a critical learning component before especially considering that unlike on EdX where course staff actually participates in the forums, on Coursera I do not think I have ever observed course staff actively participating in the forums.",2
94515,Good course. Prof. Caffo is a great teacher! Hope to see an advanced version of RegMods soon!,4
94516,"The course content was very brief and well structured, Regression being a rather vast topic demands a lot more time. 4 weeks seemed a bit less! Overall satisfied by what the course offered.",5
94517,"Good introduction to the usefulness and traps of linear models. By the way, having the teacher filmed for the lectures does provide a more engaging experience.",5
94518,Very comprehensive course for developing the basics of regression models,5
94519,"This class, along with ""Statistical Inference"" and ""Machine Language"" , are the meat and potato's for data science. I had taken most, if not all of these classes as an undergrad many years ago . The tools for stats have changed significantly and these classes being taught with the open source R language, really put you at the forefront of this new field.",5
94520,Excellent course with great didactic. Congratulations!,5
94521,Great introduction and plenty of resources for more in depth study.,5
94522,"Poorly designed, executed and instructed. Too much is left off the materials.",1
94523,"The flows of courses instructed by Caffo(Statistical Inference and Regression Models) are too long to concentrate it and the quiz is not quite related in lecture.However, Contents of the book is really good, as well as homework in the book.",3
94524,way to much emphasis on non-data science. This one course covers more information that the rest of the courses combined..,2
94525,It is a great introductory course into Regression analysis. I highly recommend it!,4
94526,This was a tough class covering a lot of material. The last week on logistic regression completely lost me. If you're new to stats like me you might want to take it more than once.,4
94527,"First 3 weeks give very reasonable overview of the subject - topics of linear / polynomial / multivariate regression are covered quite well.Week 4 is a bit sloppy and ad-hoc, comparing to first 3 weeks - GLMs are given poorly.",4
94528,"Data, our “raw” material, becomes plentiful. Let’s learn form it.Thanks to constant progress in information technologies, this increasing production of data is an outstanding opportunity to improve our knowledge of subject matters we care about, e.g. environment, health, markets…Properly analyzing these data in the scope of addressing specific questions is not trivial. But it can be learn. And if there were one place where one could acquire these skills and become anxious to grow in that field, this would be the Coursera Regression Models course. Data analysts, like any professionals, need her/his set of tools. Good tools make good patricians. The Coursera Data Science Specialization that includes this Regression Models class is where one can learn how to use the right tools and reduce them into practice. Passionate instructors who obviously take great care in communicating effectively the knowledge they master teach these courses admirably. Highly recommended course and specialization,There are so many unanswered questions, so many new relationships to uncover. Learn how.",5
94529,I just realized that you have to upgrade(pay $49) in order to submit the quiz and receive the feedback. That's depressing since my purpose is to watch the video and check out what I learned so far without getting any certificate. The policy here bring huge inconvenience for people like me.,2
94530,I expected more in Binomial Regression and Poisson regression,4
94531,Great Course,5
94532,A decent overview of regression,4
94533,Appears more like a revision for those who already know the content than geared towards those new to the subject.,2
94534,There's just something about the course content that is difficult to attain. It's presented at way too high of a level without enough tangible examples of getting down into the weeds of how to actually perform and interpret the models and functions.,3
94535,"good quick overview, could have more actual R examples in lectures",3
94536,"Loved the course and the content. Only critique is that I would have liked to have a lecture about transformations, and interpretation of transformed data coefficients.",5
94537,"As for the Statistical Inference course, this course is amazing but is presented in a more complex way than it should be. Once again the concepts are simple and the math not so hard, yet I had to do a lot of research outside the course to be able to understand these simple concepts and derive the not so hard mathematics.Brian Caffo is clearly brilliant and, I would say, seem to be a good lad too, but something is missing. Too often the details are thrown at us without being properly framed in the context or without having the proper concept being introduced progressively.I have a theory about teaching since I was 15, and so far it has proven to be true. Imagine that learning is about climbing a mountain in which tall steps have been carved. Each step is taller than the student. The teacher is somewhere higher than the students (not necessarily at the top, if there is such a thing).The job of the teacher is to throw boxes (concepts) and balls (details) of different size, shape and colors. The job of the student is to catch these boxes and balls and to put the right balls in the right boxes in order to make a staircase out of it to climb (at least) one of the giant stair up.A good teacher makes sure to throw the concepts first than the details and to clearly specify which balls go into which box, as well as which boxes go inside/over which other boxes.But most teacher simply throw the balls and boxes in an not so well structured manner, so the poor students try to catch as many as he can, but also miss a lot of them. His hands can hold a limited amount of balls. If he doesn't have the right box to put them, he would either miss the next balls, or put the one he hold in his hand in the wrong box.Bottom line, the best teachers are those who focus on the concepts (and context) and make sure that the concepts are well understood before introducing details to stuck in these concepts. From my experience our brain (or at least mine) better learn this way. It is as if our brain need first to establish a category-pattern (the concept/context) to which it will associate detail-patterns. But without a proper category-pattern, our brain is having a hard time to properly remember the detail-patterns or miss-associate them to the wrong category-pattern (which create even more confusion).Hope it was helpful somehow...",3
94538,Course teaches basics of regression in R,5
94539,"This course goes on a very fast pace and simply does not have the charm of all the other courses in the specialization. I understand that a lot of content is covered within a month, but there should be supplementary course material available. Moreover, TAs should be more active on the forums. I have seen most of the questions just being discussed among the students. A little disappointed. Will probably have to watch all the material again to have confidence with it.",3
94540,Great course with a thorough introduction to regression and linear model.,5
94541,"One of the most valuable course in series. Also one of the hardest, expecially if you are newbie to regression models.",5
94542,"Better than Stat Inference, and gave some reasonable intuition, but could be improved I think by focussing on more understanding and less maths and formulas. Some of it did seem to be - here' s a formula, plug the numbers in to get the quiz question right, whereas in reality (in the world of work) that question is completely unrealistic - you have raw data and you need to do the regression and understand what it means.",3
94543,Excellent introductory course!,5
94544,This course is packed with great lessons and Prof. Caffo puts it all together very cogently.,5
94545,I find it very tough to understand everything. Buying the course book helps to overcome this. You have to dedicate a lot of time.,3
94546,"This is the best course of the bunch so far. These courses are really promising -- I've learned a lot from them and they probably have everything they could have at the price - but I'm leaving just one star off because I feel very strongly that some effort could really go a long way to making a better language map of these courses. A person leaves this course, and even more so the inference course, not being very clear one where their new capabilities lie in the spectrum, and without the strongest sense of how to experiment with linear models.One case in point of the the huge strengths and a slight weakness of this course -- Professor Caffo mentions the wonderfully tantalizing fact that the application of linear models can get you most of the way to the top of a Kaggle competition. That feels true, I trust him, and it's really cool. But it would be SO. MUCH. COOLER. with an article showing a linear model attacking that kind of problem.",4
94547,"A few glitches, but excellent like all the other",5
94548,I have learned a lot from this course!,5
94549,This course is not organised so well concerning grading process.....there is a lot of mistakes in the criteria of grading ....also the material is not so good ....I learn nothing new ...... the worst course i took in coursera Actually so no stars goes to this course,1
94550,Great course. VEry helpful for my proper teaching.Inspiring teacher.,5
94551,Teaching behaviourism in 2017 is scandalous.,1
94552,"Excellent course, I really learned a lot and recommend it to everyone who studies film or for those who love cinema.",5
94553,Amaizing course,5
94554,How better to spend your christmas holidays when you have the dreaded MANFLU?This is the best Coursera course I have ever enrolled in never mind completed!,5
94555,"I enjoyed this course very much. Had value. I watch Scandinavian TV and films from the U.S. via Netflix, Amazon and MhZ Choice via livestreaming. In the future I would like more emphasis on recent or current Scandinavian film including actors, actresses, cinematography techniques, etc. Also, the video lengths were fine but the presenters need to be trained and give more engaging, lively presentations --- a bit too classroom ""lecturish"". Thank you!",3
94556,"I enjoyed the lectures and content. I would have liked to see more use of clips. The quiz format (select 2, select 3) is not one I find effective and often leads to the creation of ""trick"" question through wording that don't really assess conceptual understanding. The same is true of history class questions of the old school - recall a name, date or place.",4
94557,"Enlightening and thought provoking. Thank you for the background on the various Scandinavian cultures, media business models, and film/TV marks and accomplishments - also for presenting the material in a well-organized and efficient manner. Really enjoyed the course, and look forward to viewing more Scandinavian film and television.",5
94558,"Good learning!, I love learning about the Scandinavian culture.",5
94559,"I like the course so much .Taking part in it made me experience a different way of films and television,especially made in Scandinavian.I did not know anything about European movies before until I participate in it. It is a memorable experience for me,it led me to a different world about movies and television.Thank you for the course.",5
94560,"Though a little dry at times, this course is extremely informative and provides examples of every main topic it covers. I also appreciate that each lecture is broken into 3 segments, for when I have limited time or attention span.",4
94561,This is a very good module with concise style.,5
94562,Wonderfull course. I could learn hardly about the many particularities of the nordic televison and cinema.,5
94563,The cource was very informative and easy to follow.,4
94564,A brilliant course :) I loved it.,5
94565,Awesome course and completely useful to understand better the history of Scandinavian Film and Television but also the circumstances that had made possible the big contents we are seeing coming from that region today.,5
94566,A great course about Nordic film and TV media. I learn a lot and decide to watch some works mentioned in the course!!!,5
94567,I found the lectures very interesting; but was surprised at how the quizzes / assignments focused so much on facts and figures - surely these aren't nearly as important as understanding the content?,3
94568,"It was an eye opener and enjoyed every second of the course. A well laid out course covering all ages of Scandinavian cinema and television, from silent days to VOD. An essential course for all cinema and television enthusiast.",5
94569,"The information was perfectly curated for this course. It's all very interesting, and they cover a large spam of time with the key aspects of each time or movement without it being tiring, too technical or repetitive.",5
94570,"It is actually very interesting to listen to lectures and take quizzes. Thanks, Coursera)",5
94571,"Although the form of lecturing is quite limited in this course, I still found it attractive. Just if you are interested in the topic. Information quantity is just enough, and well organized. Tiny quizzes are there for you to recall the things that you just listened to. I like it and hope there're more courses about Nordic culture and social system.",4
94572,Great learning! Very inspirational course.,5
94573,"Very interesting course, helps understanding of a number of Scandinavian television crime dramas that have made it to the UK.",4
94574,This course was excellent. Great source material and the lectures were very informative. Thanks!,5
94575,great intro,5
94576,when is the update?,5
94577,"Although I have passion with film, the quizzes seems to have lots of technical problems. I dropped out right on the first module",1
94578,"Thank you to the instructors and the university! A very interesting course that not only focuses on the content and quality of Scandinavian TV and movie productions but also on the broader (institutional and cultural) framework in which they are produced. I would have rated it 4.5 starts if possible, but as halves are not possible I give it 4. Possible improvements:-the delivery of the course can be a bit livier, smoother; some instructors seem a bit at unease with this format-while an interest in Scandinavian movies and TV series is an implicit prerequisite for a course like this, sometimes simply mentioning 'lists' of directors, movies, series you might never have heard of can make it a bit overwhelming, hard to relate to-students' engagement could be enhanced with more interactive assignments",4
94579,"Very descriptive, educational and fun as a filmmaking course. It teaches the various prospects of film in denmark, sweden and norway among scandinavia.",4
94580,I loved this course!,5
94581,"This is a lousy course.The subject and material could be interesting; however, the lectures are inanimate and the quizzes are a Rubic's cubes of sudden death with no value to assess whether you've understood the key points of the lectures!While this course was a timed release (implying someone at the U of Copenhagen is involved with it week to week, it feels as if it is an archived course with no live administration; the only interaction you seem to have is with other students.This has got to be the worst Coursera course I have taken and I have taken quite a few.",1
94582,"Very good course as a starting point. Although it still shall be better if there could be more detailed, academic study contents involved. And in addition, it might be both more inspiring and more attracting if the lecturer giving the information with more spoken presentation which approaching to a real class rather than a fixed script text.",3
94583,It's a great introduction to Scandinavian visual culture. The course is well prepared by all the professors and it is easy to understand even for the people who doesn't have background education in cinema. I hope there will be more specific courses in Scandinavian cinema for the future.,5
94584,Teaching style of teachers is very dry and boring.,2
94585,Short overview of history without much of a value.,1
94586,"I'm three weeks into and really enjoying this course. It's light – about 2-3 hours a week so far, plus maybe one film, feels sufficient. The student is free to choose her degree of intensity. At the same time it opens a richness of vistas on the study of film in general as well as the course content.I think it's a good model for the massive online course: both highly customisable and sufficiently demanding (deadlines are essential) to maintain engagement.",5
94587,"If you want to memorize what year countries started their public broadcast systems, this is the course for you.It only briefly discusses critical paradigm shifts and shows. The course lacks a critical analysis element and the video lectures are unstructured. It would be almost impossible to pick three key points they want you to learn from each video.",1
94588,It is an informative and well-prepared course and you can see how much time the professors have spent.,5
94589,"Very Interesting so far, great profesors",5
94590,"I enjoy every lecture of professor Maslov. I've listened to all records and interviews with him available on youtube, and I DO recommend everyone!His English is perfect, I understand every word though I am Russian. Would appreciate to see more courses with him in the future no matter in English or Russian.",5
94591,"Great course! Goes over proper statistical inference and its interpretation from multiple perspectives. The hands-on R exercises are invaluable. Don't be scared off by them - you don't really need to know R to do them. If you interpret literature from the psychological or medical fields, this is a great resource.",5
94592,Great course! Everybody doing human/social science should do it!,5
94593,Very good!!! I like this course and the hair style of the professor. ^_^,5
94594,Exactly what i needed. But now it,5
94595,"This course was very helpful indeed. My insight into these areas of statistics is now better than it was before, and it wasn't even a terribly painful experience! It was refreshing to have statistical concepts explained so clearly and - dare I say - sensibly. I have already recommended this course to several colleagues and will keep doing so. Thank you very much for putting together such a high-quality course!",5
94596,Wonderful course! It was really well-conceived and I learned a lot. Would definitely recommend it to everyone interested in statistics!,5
94597,Excellent course. The lecturer has written code snippets that let the students visualize the meaning and interrelationship of p-values confidence-intervals power effect-size bayesian-inference.,5
94598,"Wonderful course: very interesting, and very well explained. Also, the teacher is a very kind and helpful person (at least in Twitter ;-P). Thanks Daniël.",5
94599,Great high level overview of intermediate applied statistics. The instructors presentation skills and pace are very good as well.,5
94600,Probably the best stats course I've ever taken (and also the most fun and enlightening)!,5
94601,One of the best Coursera courses! Daniel Lakens for the win!,5
94602,"This was a really well presented course, giving a fantastic overview of inferential statistics and always presented with a sense of humour! A number of really useful tools where introduced which I will be using again and again.",5
94603,It is good indeed. Such course is needed more on Coursera.,5
94604,fun and very informative course - thank you very much!,5
94605,"Easy to follow, light workload, and most importantly: very useful material of supreme importance.",5
94606,"This course is totally awesome! Statistical inference is critical in any science. Why collect data if we do not know what to infer from the data? Unfortunately, many disciplines use outdated or incorrect practices. This course provides an excellent review of state of the art approaches and provides students with many thought-proving opportunities to practice their inferential skills. As a professor of Psychology, I am not embarrassed to say that I learned lots from this course. The lectures, demos, and R scripts are useful tools that I will integrate in my teaching and my own research. Although the course topic is challenging, the course is organized well and does not drown students in technical terms. However, if you take this course, you better be serious and dedicated. The course is challenging, but the knowledge and skills gained are a rewarding experience.",5
94607,Amazing learning experience,5
94608,Great course. Daniel explains everything clearly and with examples in R code which makes all of the concepts easier to understand. A must-take for experimental psychologists.,5
94609,"I encourage all my friends in research to not do anything before doing this course! The pedagogical touch is different to any stats classes I've been on or stats MOOCs I've taken. After many lectures, I was just left staring at the screen, with the phrase ""I must tell everyone"" repeating in my head :)",5
94610,"Extremely useful cours, especially the first 5 weeks! Pleasant and enjoyable. Definitely recommended!",5
94611,highly recomended for all level. The explanation is very beginners friendly.,5
94612,"The video is ok, but it lacks a lot of details in calculation. The assignment is very confusing because some questions refer to some 'previous' statement while fail to clarify which is related.",3
94613,"I'm so glad I took this class! I learned how to better design experiments and interpret common statistical practices in the literature. The lectures are entertaining and informative, and the professor is charming and funny. Even though I'm an immunologist and the course is aimed at the social sciences, I feel like a better scientist now.",5
94614,"Great course, much appreciated. Thanks a lot",5
94615,Some courses are useful in the short run while others can challenge your way of thinking for the rest of your professional life. This course is the latter!,5
94616,"Very well designed course, from a didactic as well as from an entertainment point of view. I was able to close many gaps in my inferential statistics knowledge and now feel much more confident in my interpretations.",5
94617,"Fantastic, enjoyable, entertaining with a dash of humor. Highly recommended for non-statisticians interested in improving their grasp of the field.",5
94618,"Dear Daniel,Let me thank you for this marvel of yours. Your course helped me to revise and to (re)structure previously learned issues, it enriched me with new contexts that were presented in a truly enjoyable way, and last but not least, it gave me completely new insights including the role of simulations in teaching.Many thanks for your work!",5
94619,"This course was great. I have worked with statistics for a while but always grappled with some concepts. Having completed this course, I feel much more confident in interpreting findings and designing studies. This is especially the case for Bayesian statistics and likelihoods that were not even part of the curriculum when I went to university.",5
94620,"Excellent, may I say indispensable course for every social scientist out there to improve their statistical skills. Very coherent and comprehensive!",5
94621,Great lectures and really helpful simulations. Very engaging and interesting. Full of useful resources.,5
94622,"This course really delivers on its core premise: it helped me understand the core principles behind frequentist statistics, gave me some basic understanding of Bayesian statistics, and will definitely prevent me from chasing my tail as far as potential future research is concerned.Although the course seems to be addressed to current and future researchers, I would recommend taking it to anyone interested in science as it will give you tools to read and understand research papers (esp. the basic reports in social science/experimental psychology).I would consider this course an excellent resource and introduction to the so-called ""new statistics"", and covers topics crucial to conducting reproducible research.The lectures are wonderfully taught and explain everything clearly. The hands-on assignments are challenging for the right reason: they test your knowledge and comprehension of the material at hand (some on-line courses did a number on me, and required extracurricular knowledge in order to succeed with completing the assignments).I think that even stats newbies might be able to take the course and learn a lot, as most of the material pretty much addresses the basic, core philosophy of statistics, and you don't need to know how to conduct specific tests in order to understand what Daniel is trying to share with you.This course is *the* course for anyone eager to understand what their stats 101 classes failed to even address.",5
94623,"To get this out of the way: The one star deduction is not related to the content of the course, only to the fact that there is occasional imprecise language and some parts of the material have typos and grammatical slip-ups that show that the course has room for some tightening up.That being said, the selection of topics that are covered is great. You get a small but full package of both knowledge and tools that'll help you to significantly (no pun intended) improve your research. Not only are statistical pitfalls covered and solutions offered, you also learn something about how to approach your research with the right mind-set in order to produce solid empirical knowledge that contributes to a cumulative science.I was particularly impressed by how the instructor manages to pack lots of important topics and concepts into his 10 or 15 minutes lectures without it becoming overwhelming. The key to this is his ability to maintain focus and his generally clear and concise language. The course material, too, reflects the ability to present just the right amount of information - not too little, not too much.Overall, the course feels very pragmatic and hands-on. It proves that good and fruitful science is doable and that you can start right now. It makes you *want* to start right now.",4
94624,"Clear explanations of the concepts of statistics, without too much emphasis on the formulas. With handy references to online tools, like power calculators.",5
94625,Really nice course! begins from basics but gives you a deeper understanding of concepts. Plus the quizzes are open for auditing (as one expects from an open science advocate)!,5
94626,"Very good instructor. Engaging, clear, concise explanations. No mumbling.",5
94627,Best educator ever. Thank him for this course!,5
94628,Thank you so much for the informative and helpful course!!,5
94629,"Dr. Brooks makes a great professional instruction by constantly citing the research which supports the statements she does in the learning materials, as mentioning when there is no research, or this has resulted confusing upon the statements she is doing. The course provides a detailed summary of key aspects of the science of training young athletes in a fair depth, tests often include feed-back which can clarify concepts whether you get the answers right or wrong, and all materials are organized in a logical way. In my opinion, the course may improve by adding readings, instead of pushing every insight in a lecture, which results challenging to remember or completely understand sometimes. As well including case studies instead of an essay as the only written assignment may result more pragmatic and interesting. Finally, elaborating on the feed-back received after tests, pointing to the learning materials containing the information, and doing more specific questions for the forums may encourage more effectively learners to participate! Thank you so much!",4
94630,I found this course very informative and useful. I am particularly interested in issues of fatigue and therefore will take the relevant information into account when training. Highly recommended.,5
94631,Follows on exactly where part 1 left off. Superbly relevant for any coach and some great information and knowledge to keep with you throughout your career.,5
94632,Great course adding critical knowledge to my coaching skills!,5
94633,Excellent short course on the management of protected areas in Africa. I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in developing an understanding in protected area management.,5
94634,"Very interesting and helpful by teaching me about the field I want to work in, thank you. Many documents to read. More people should pay attention to these important subjects.",5
94635,"I think it is the hardest course among all other courses in this specialization, but it was completely convenient .",5
94636,"Very uneven. There are some good insights and ideas in there, but no way will a beginner be able to make sense of this. It's more like a sort of refresher/inspiration course.",3
94637,"The course starts with a nice mathematical support. Midway it looses connection with mathematical details in a way that it becomes too vague and does not empower the student to really grasp the concepts. Some energy-based proofs and the few formulas presented are inserted a bit adhoc and not properly explained.Despite not being to my liking in terms of depth, It is a good course as a general understanding of what has been accomplished in robotic legged-locomotion, what the state of the art is and where to find literature.",3
94638,"Interesting class, but somewhat frustrating at times. I found the quizzes very conceptual, which was interesting, but trying to find the correct answer with no feedback as to how something was right or wrong made for a weaker learning experience. Had there been some feedback to understand why something is correct or not, I think that would enable more learning.I also think more emphasis on Forward Kinematics and Inverse Kinematics would help ground this class as a more general class for students interested in robotics. Introduction to Jacobians and how we can calculate end effector forces with respect to joint torques would really help interlace this class with some of the other classes in this Robotics specialization. It seems like it sticks out the most.Still. Interesting class and I learned some new stuff!",3
94639,Amazing course about legged robot,5
94640,it is interesting but diffucult for me.,5
94641,"Excellent class, though the content is a lit bit complicated that it seems not easy to clearly explain the details in a mooc.",5
94642,"Pretty good one, better than I expected.",5
94643,"The lectures are a very brief overview of topics, with nothing actually taught. The quizzes are entirely disconnected from the lectures and require basically just finding and reading the right wikipedia pages. This course is an absolute joke and an embarrassment to UPenn, Coursera, and everyone involved. It's clear that the instructors don't care about student's actually learning anything. Compare this to the ""Underactuated Robotics"" course on EdX.",1
94644,Awesome course,4
94645,"The course is not bad, but the information of the slides doesn't gives you much information to solve the questions. You have to go to other resources to solve the math questions.The simulations are OK, very practical and comprehensive but there is no math information about the movement or equations of motion on the slides, off course, if you have the matlab code you can do reverse engineering and aim the goal. If you expect to learn about robotics motion and mobility you have to go to other books of these themes.There are too much questions in my opinion and are tedious to solve or answer.",3
94646,Interesting course but the lectures are lacking in imformation. I would recommend as long as you don't mind a,4
94647,"Vague content, quiz and programming assignments not exactly related to video lecture content.",2
94648,"If you love to see a couple of entertaining movies about robots and some interesting concepts about them, grab some popcorn and take this course, because, hey, it’s about cool robots!!If you are crazy enough and actually want to learn something new or even consider to get the certificate, I would not recommend to participate in this course. The videos are quite ok and cover a good part of what I think this course should be about. But there are a bunch of quizzes, which are sometimes quite off the lecture material and you have to research a lot to get all of the questions right. I managed to solve all quizzes in the end, but it was some kind of a frustrating and discouraging process.",2
94649,Not the best course of the serie. It is a pity because I had great expectation in this course.,2
94650,This course is the worst one in this specialization. The notations are ambiguous and the quizzes are poorly designed.,1
94651,Course is interesting and provides basic knowledge of the subject. But often the tests require more information than provided in the questions or lectures. Also very less help is provided in the forums.,4
94652,many subjects are not clear enough.it is better to put links and pictures than send us to look in lectures for a specific time frame.and still it was very interesting and motivating course. thanks!,3
94653,I feel that the lecture material lacks proper explanation of the key concepts but the questions in quizzes are good although the lectures should have been more conceptual rather than theoretical,2
94654,"The Course material and method of testing the understanding of the student needs to be improved. Despite the low quality of the quizzes, the course is very inspiring. The examples showed are very good and the lectures concentrated on teaching the underlying concept rather the Mathematics involved, which was refreshing.",3
94655,"The course was very good, but I guess there were too many quizzes, and the instructions / questions in the quizzes and other assignments are not unambiguous. That could be improved. Other than that I liked the course and the specialization very much.",4
94656,"The material in the quizzes is not adequately described in the lectures or notes. Some of the quizzes require 100% to complete with some problems being quite difficult. Most importantly, I do not believe the course leaves behind an effective understanding of the material that would allow you to apply it. I thought the aerial course was much better.",2
94657,"This course, was really bad structured, was often the discrepancy between the information provided in the videos and the questions in the Quiz. Also a lot of time the system was very picky to take an answer like correct, just because the format used, for example e!=E in one equation, and because this was necessary a lot of guessing in order to find how the system take the answer by correct.But really the worst was the discrepancy between the video and the quiz, because my impression is that the videos were cut to fix in the time, but they were cut a lot, missing important information to be used in the quiz.",1
94658,"This is the worst course online I've done so far. I would not recommend it to anyone as it stands, regardless of the student's background, this course is just poor and lacking.The premise of this course is a promising one, the topic is still in its infancy and seems very interesting. Having said that, this is about everything positive that I can say about this course.For starters, the videos seem good at first, but later it becomes very superficial and monotone. The content is many times just rushed through and it's visible that the lecturers at several occasions have difficulty even to read their own slides!However, the worst part of the course are the quizzes. There are 24 graded quizzes in total, to pass the course you need to pass all 24 of them! To make matters worse, the minimum passing marks for each quiz is 80%, that wouldn't have been such an issue if most quizzes had 5 or more questions, which is not the case, most of the quizzes have 4 or less questions. This is such an unreasonable requirement, if you miss only one question in a quiz with 3 questions there's already no chance to pass the course!The content of each quiz is also very troublesome, we are essentially being graded for trivia, a considerable number of the questions are very superficially related to not related at all to the subject of each lecture. Instead of using the questions to delve deeper into the topic at hand, they only create confusion with futilities. A little example, the topic of a subject was about the mechanical properties of using multiple templates and a question in its quiz was about an electric circuit that is never shown in the question itself, only briefly shown in the lecture video for about 10s, minimal information is given without any explanation of what they mean and we are asked to enter a formula as the answer for which also almost no information is given about which notation we should use for the formula itself.There are other cases where there are multiple choice questions which have incorrect answers accepted by the grader. In one instance, two of the options available are contradictory to each other, however the accepted answer was the one involving both. In another instance, there was more than one solution available to an answer, however the grader accepted only one and there was no information in the question itself to narrow down the possible answers to the desired one.Finally, there is no active community by the TA and professors, I have never had a single answer form a TA or professor, only sporadical replies from a mentor, who has no authority to fix any issue by him or herself.All these issues just point to how poorly this course was designed. It had such high hopes, but they fell short flat. In doing this course, I found myself reverse engineering most of the questions just to try to find an accepted answer and try to understand what it meant. The imposed 8-hour period between attempts at the quizzes only hindered my progress. I was focused and engaged in studying for each quiz, however, after 3 failed attempts I had an imposed break period that makes little sense. In the end, this course only made me feel like the very object of my learning: a robot.I am really disappointed with this course.",1
94659,Loads of room for improvement,2
94660,"A tough course,yet agood one if you are persistent. The materials and some Quizzes seems out of touch,you will be searching all over the web for answers because the lectures simply wont have those answers,This is a fairly high level intro to mobility ,you must be persistent .to complete this .",5
94661,"This course covers very interesting topics, but there are some serious shortcomings in the lectures. Too much information is just omitted or taken for granted. Some of the lecturers are rather inexperienced. Reading or reciting mathematical expressions in a monotonous voice without actually pointing to the visual representation of the lecture material makes it very difficult to follow. Better care should also be taken with the quizzes - if one looks at the comments or questions posted by some learners, it is clear that we simply don't understand the question, or a question is answered correctly in essence , but the quizz expected more (or less) precision without stating so . Finally for some reason the support from Technical Advisors was also lacking in the specific session that I did, contributing to my frustration and rather negative experience of what could be a very good course",2
94662,"The course was very good overall. I just wish if there was a little more mathematics involved. For the rest of the part, it is pretty good for beginners and enthusiasts in Robotics. Hope to see the advanced version of it sometime too.",4
94663,This is one of the very first courses in Robotics in which in legged robots are talked about. And from this course I learnt some very significant factors to consider when working with legged structures and the mobility in them.,4
94664,Good course. Stands well in the specialization. It was a bit buggy throughout tho. And the assignments could have focussed more on the control part.,3
94665,There must be something wrong to spend time on google&wiki much more than the course content.,3
94666,I will never walk the same. This course has some of the coolest content in robotics and the instructor is great!,5
94667,Poorly designed course which tests people on things that are not taught.,1
94668,"Despite the arguments of this module are extremely interesting and very useful for Robotics, I think the way they are treated is very poor.In my opinion lectures are so superficial that it is almost a waste of time to follow them.Lectures are completely useless and most of the time quizzes are note related with them.In order to solve quizzes you have not only to recover prior knowledge, that it is obvious, but also to search for new arguments somwhere in the web, in some other courses where contents are better treated and explained. In that contest what are the quizzes, what should quizzes have to test if no content is given?Moreover it often happen that without a clear support from the lectures, questions are confused and ambiguous. It is quite difficult to follow the teaching path and to enrich my knowledge.I think it is a very bad way to make a course and often the pleasure to follow disappears leaving a sense of frustration and futility.I arrived at the end of the course just because I'm doing the specialization otherwise I would have left in the middle of the first week.I'm very disappointed.",1
94669,Good teachers but a lot of questions in the quizzes were very ambiguous and unrelated to the Course Content.,3
94670,"I think this was a poorly structured online course. Especially for someone who is attempting this course having experienced two excellent previous courses in the specialization. It was good only in few patches but the link was seriously missing. I realize this area is a bit more advanced but with all due respect to the knowledgeable instructors, they could have emphasised more on basic building blocks rather than cramming in so much information which my bandwith couldn't handle it. I did guesswork in almost all the quizzes after week 2 which further adds to my disappointment.I think the Robotics specialization is better off without this course because there is little or no value addition here. Expecting a lot better from the next course in the series.",2
94671,"The course provides good exposure to the problems in legged robotics.The course lists multiple references to the books and articles, reading which is necessary to make this course more useful. I wish some more time would be devoted to dynamic models, including kinetic and potential energy calculation of the SLIP and other models. But one can find this kind of information elsewhere, for example, at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhk9xLjrmi4 and http://ocw.mit.edu/2-003SCF11",4
94672,"Very interesting course, both tests and assignments aredemanding but fair.Biggest problem of this course is that not all required topics are coveredenough in lectures.",3
94673,Poorly structured.Bloated.Discontinuous content.,2
94674,"In some ways good, but deeply flawed. The assignments were weakly correlated with the lectures, and no explanation was given for correct answers or for incorrect answers.I believe the authors would have benefited greatly from getting outside feedback from an advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate student, rather than each other.",2
94675,"This course helped me identify my interest at the intersection of biomechanics and robotics. The lectures were very motivating which gave a birds eye view of the background and research in mobility of legged robots. While watching the lectures, I expected programming assignments involving simulation of dynamics and control of the templates and further perform compositions with them but didn't find them much. In a few assignments, the wording of the questions was ambiguous or the grader accepted only certain answers; hence, consumed a lot of time. However, the TAs were very helpful in clearing most of the doubts very quickly which also made solving the assignments easier. Further, it provided references to abundant resources to steer the student in the right direction to pursue specific interests. Overall, this four-week course provided a very good intuitive understanding of the dynamics and control of legged mobility in animals and robots.",4
94676,"Interesting to learn about how and why robots differ from animals. The material was relatively easy to digest because the lectures were well paced and at the end there was a summary of the content. The quizzes are intelligent, so the course is not a give away.",4
94677,"This course is a disappointment after the previous two courses in the specialisation. It tries to cover too many topics. As a result it provides a shallow introduction to many topics rather than deep coverage of any one topic. I do not feel I have learnt anything of substance.Many of the assignment questions are poorly written. To name one example, assignment 3.1.1 question 3 has at least three correct answers, but the grader accepts only one of them. I wasted hours trying to work out why it was marking my answer wrong.The lectures by the TAs are delivered in a ""robotic"" tone if you'll pardon the pun. They are reading off an autocue and it shows.",2
94678,The course served as a great introduction to legged robots and the templates that anchor them. The teaching staff was also very responsive to questions on the discussions forum which was immensely helpful.,4
94679,"The course has a lot of interesting material, but I believe that a few points may be improved:1) Exercises with Matlab are not programming ones (except for the PD controller). In my opinion, more detailed exercises (with a guide for solving them) would help to understand better the concepts behind the theory. For example, programming a rimless wheel or a SLIP template.2) The course has a strong emphasis in theory. Some of the lectures were boring an difficult to follow. As I said before, a more practical approach would be more rewarding.3) Quizzes were sometimes based on intuition, or topics outside of the course, rather than topics learned from the lessons.On the other side, the TAs were highly involved in the course. In addition, an extensive list of additional resources (books, papers) is a plus.I believe that the following sessions will be better than the first one!",2
94680,"Nice high level overview of the motion of robots. I would have liked to do more programming (modeling of robots, controllers, etc.) in the course and have the lectures tie in closer with the content of the quizzes. The TAs were very active in the forums and helped clarify/fix any problems that came up.",3
94681,very interesing lessons.Make me think more between automation and biology,5
94682,"It is not well done as the previous courses. The quizzes usually do not concern the topic of the lessons or better, the lessons do not help in anyway to solve the problems.",1
94683,The quiz do not relate to the lectures....a lot of thinks need to be explore in documents outside of the course and the knowledge of the student has to be higher. Not a course for not engineering background.,1
94684,"Unfortunately, this specific course lacks in-depth information and problems and exercises in order to get an individual to explore the wide subject, that is, statistics.",1
94685,I suggest to include more and clearer examples to solve problems.,1
94686,Excellent course. Greetings from Egypt. :),5
94687,"Great course!As usual, Dr Shane Dixon and Dr Jessica Cinco were at their usual best. I loved watching their videos and leant a lot.",5
94688,"Once again, great ideas to teach!",4
94689,it is a perfect course,5
94690,it was challenaging,5
94691,"I really enjoyed the lessons that related to various parts of the Wizard of Oz....made the class meaningful and ""sticky"". Well done!",5
94692,"This course is very satisfying to me, and I have a lot of gains",5
94693,"If you want to learn how to teach listening, speaking, and pronunciation in a classroom, this is ""the"" course.",5
94694,Excellent course for ESL Teachers,5
94695,"I've really enjoyed taking this course, not only I've found it to be valuable, but entertaining as well.",5
94696,"Whew ! Tough one, this is.",5
94697,It was helpful,5
94698,"Excellent course, it was fun, enjoyable, easy to understand and useful in the major ESL context classes.",5
94699,It's great course.It helped me a lot.Thanks everybody.,5
94700,"Amazing! The way these teachers present information is awesome!!! Ive learnt so much from these course and the best thing is that they actually SHOW you what it is like to be a teacher, not just theorize (like you do that, but we will teach you differently). Great course - totally worth it!",5
94701,great experience that was,5
94702,Great course! Love the videos,5
94703,"I like to thanks Jessica Cinco, Dr. Shane Dixon, Dr. Justin Shewell and everyone involved in teaching of this wonderful and interesting course. It really gives you the essential tools to teach in a way that is very reliable and precise.",5
94704,Very useful!,5

94712,A brilliant offering! Thanks!!,5
94713,It is organized very well and the materials in this course are very useful for teaching. the teachers are very passionate and lovely. I like this course very much!,5
94714,Very interesting class,5
94715,I found this course gave me great tools to improve my classes. Being a teacher is not something easy but with practice and great professor like the ones in this course we sure can give better things to our students.,4
94716,"Great course! It was really informative and interesting. I wasn't actually big on the game show videos, but the information provided was useful and I feel like I have a good understanding of how to execute a well planned lesson in listening, speaking, and pronunciation. Thanks to all of you for your hard work and effort!",5
94717,"It was a great course, just like all of the others.",5
94718,It is a really interesting course which you can learn easily. It provides different listening techniques to use in every day class with your students.,4
94719,A totally enlightening one of a kind experience!!!!,5
94720,Excellent. Learned so much. Thank you to our course instructors for amazing learning experience.,5
94721,Lessons and videos in this class have been very well crafted and created. The lessons are both entertaining and informative at the same time. Good job ASU Teach English Now! Team!,5
94722,This course was a lot of fun and I've learnt a lot. I recommend it to everyone.,5
94723,Lots of great ideas presented in a very logical and easy to understand approach !,5
94724,great course,5
94725,"I just love this course! Clear, useful, and fun.",5
94726,"Didn't like trying to hammer in recommended activities into my lessons, would be better to create new material and use that.",2
94727,nice course I really learnt a lot,4
94728,Very good course.,5
94729,"One of the best courses ever! Clearly and thoroughly explains what to do and what not to when teaching Listening, Speaking, and Pronunciation.Two thumbs up!",5
94730,"Love it, as usual. Great course, good set up and great way of teaching (texts, videos and fun)",5
94731,"Thank you so much, I loved this course. I am looking forward to participating in next course. Once again, Thank you so much.",5
94732,its amazing how densely constructed this course is. kudos to the educating team.,5
94733,"Wow! I really loved this part of the course. It has been a pleasure to take part in it. I have learned something new about Listening, Speaking, and Pronunciation that I have not thought about from this point of view. Thank you very much!",5
94734,Recommended for teachers new and experienced alike. I have been teaching overseas for a decade and still learned a tremendous amount from these courses. A+,5
94735,Excellent course! Thank you very much!,5
94736,It's recommendable if you'd like to get improve your English proficiency at teaching.,5
94737,"all steps are given so easy to understand with important details to applyit is so good, do not miss!",5
94738,a very informative course that gives you a good understanding of the complexities regarding an ever changing planet!! I enjoyed it.,5
94739,"Dear All,Initially the course material may look brief. Trust me and go through the course material twice and then let your imaginations fly.Fantastic course and fantastic course mentors!!!!!RegardsRajeev",5
94740,Loved It! looking to do a masters on same domain.,5
94741,"Brilliantly framed and paced, the course offers a wonderful exposure to the safety and security issues at play today. Loved the Explore, Understand, Do mechanism, will definitely use that if I face a case where it's use is warranted. Highly recommended for anyone looking to get a deeper understanding of the importance of privacy, different level of stakeholders involved and the risk everyone faces when an issue gets out of hand. Thank you for such a great course !",5
94742,"This was my first MOOC course, but I enjoyed the course. The lessons/videos were clear and precise and the course contains a lot of relevant information in the field of security and safety cases. The cases and interesting assignments were relevant and interesting.",5
94743,These course shows youhow to analyse a current security conflict by applying diferent perspective and knowledge from different fields of study. It is surely one of the most valuable courses to join if you are interested in Security and International Relations.,5
94744,"The objective of the MOOC ""Security&Safety Challenges in a Globalized World"" is to develop and disseminate knowledge in the field of security and safety through lenses of the interdisciplinary approach.",5
94745,IT IS A NICE COURSE WITH EXCELLENT MATERIAL AND EXCELLENT TEACHERS.,5
94746,"I have taken several MOOCs from several Universities and think that the Dutch ones (Universiteit Amsterdam & Universiteit Leiden) are amongst the best. I used to live in Leiden so I must confess as little personal bias, but what I really applaud is the way that the instructors actively encourage you to find out more than what's just required to obtain a pass mark. I think I'm now quite an expert on Volcanoes!",5
94747,Definitely a very light course designed for beginners and to promote the Leiden's 3 Years International Studies Program in Safety and Security! Somewhat very disappointing to me! Useful to note the not so realistic 3 peer-reviews awaited in that course... Two of 1000 words and one of 350-550 words! Totally unbalanced!,2
94748,Nice course. The information about pathogenesis of disease is interesting. Giving example with person image and following up step by step drawings and scribbled notes make it a movie like flow.,5
94749,"Another fantastic course that gives real insight into how the human body acquires and responds to infections. For all those who have been affected by one of the conditions here or who are simply in the biological and diagnostic processes involved in infections, I would highly recommend this course.",5
94750,This course was pretty emotional but also very interesting. I enjoyed this one a lot!,5
94751,"Wonderful and informative course. I always make sure to take the courses with this instructor; she has a wonderful way of explaining complex materials and her voice is a pleasure to listen to. The images along with the narrative are such a great teaching technique, I will definitely be rewatching the videos and recommending to others. Thanks for a great course and all your hard work!",5
94752,"Took this course for job purposes. It is great for everyone, although I believe that people with some background in comparative literature will benefit from it the most,",5
94753,Sensitive and erudite double-handed presentation by the two profs. Informative - it is of course meant to be educational.From separate perspectives of literature and history they maintain an engaging tension that avoids personalisation whilst being clear that personal it really is.I really could do with them supervising me as Phd student (an elderly on). I would sit happily at their feet.,5
94754,Fascinating insights!,5
94755,"Dark and disturbing though the course material is, this course is an absolute must for all who are interested in the Shoah and the depths of mans' inhumanity.",5
94756,I learned a lot in this class.,5
94757,second time I take this course!!!!!!,5
94758,Good historical overview. I especially liked the 'case studies' of the various European countries during the 40s. The literature part included some very good reading and interesting movies. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the topic o,4
94759,I love the classes!,5
94760,"One of the greatest experiences of my life in knowledge, is a course of self-improvement, faith, clinching my admiration for the Jews. If the intention of the perpetrators of the Holocaust is to deny the Shoah with terrifying acts that can not be talked, this course detracts the intention very high.",5
94761,"This course is extraordinary. The 2 professors who present the material are both experts in their respective areas: Holocaust history and Comparative Literature. They present the material not only from a profound academic understanding, they are both children of the Holocaust. And so they convey the material in a deeply personal and human way as well. Using the Holocaust as a momentous backdrop, the professors challenge the students to examine important philosophical questions throughout the course. The books and movies discussed are absolutely wonderful. Finally, the relationship between Murray and Peter, that of deep trust and respect, contrast so powerfully with the inhumanity of the topic they present. This is one of the best courses that I have ever taken in my life, including my time during college.",5
94762,"It was very interesting learning about the holocaust from two different perspectives. I also thought the selection of books, movies and other learning devices were very important in learning about the holocaust.",5
94763,An absolute must for every social human being.,5
94764,"This was very interesting, I had to keep listening, it made it so personal. (I had relatives who perished in Minsk) Excellent course and fascinating tutors.",5
94765,This is a very great course that the global community must have access too and study thepolitical and historic reasons that led to the horrors of the Holocaust.Please keep this course available for study permanently on Coursera.Thank you.,5
94766,I want to say how much I especially enjoyed Dr Kenez and his very clear and concise lectures on the historical aspects of the subject matter. Thank you very much. Richard Kilgore,5
94767,"The presentations raise vital questions , dis-aggregates historical experience and has generated interest in me to study the issues further . Many thanks to the Professors.",5
94768,"Even though I didn't write the papers for a certificate, this course was interesting and valuable. I have taken two other Holocaust courses, one historical and one film and literature; this course was the best of both and more.Thank you to Peter and Murray for all of their insight and knowledge.",5
94769,"The historical lectures were marvelous; the literature lectures only a little less so. But the most enjoyable was both extremely knowledgable professors.If you want to truly understand the myriad background, the Nazi psychology and insanity, the witness of those who suffered the most, and the in-depth story of the Holocaust, this is an outstanding academic experience.",5
94770,I found this course extremely informative. I would recommend it to anyone interested in a detailed history on the Holocaust.,5
94771,"I love the course, love the professors. Great course! Thank you!",5
94772,"Fascinating historical, sociological, cultural, and literary journey through the Holocaust and the years preceding and following.",4
94773,"Thank you! Wonderful course, marvellous teachers. Everybody should study european history has much as we did during these lectures. I'll miss it.",5
94774,Great course. I have learn a lot. Thank you a lot to Professors Kenez and Baumgarten and all the staff from Coursera,5
94775,i have took before courses about the holocaut but this was remarkably different and so very interesting!professors are both incredible and i loved how they expose the subject,5
94776,This was an excellent historical account of the Holocaust. Thank you for sharing your knowledge and personal accounts of this event.,5
94777,"Course lacks wider and real socio-political context of the XIX and XX century Central and Eastern Europe. Additionally, it is full of statements that are not supported by the historical facts.",1
94778,"Great course divided by two gentlemen professors who lived through the era with personal experience. I loved the division of literature sources and historical events which knitted together harmoniously, and I liked also the lectures tremendously. Thanks. Dr John Quincy, BS, MBA, MLA, DDS, (+104 Coursera Courses and counting).",5
94779,"So far this course is fantastic. I have taken classes on this subject before however, the personal touches and the passion of both professors is contagious !! I recommend that all high school and secondary students should take this course, lest we forget and repeat these atrocities. Thank you both for a fascinating look at a terrible time in history!!",5
94780,very usefull,5
94781,"I have read about Agile practices and well aware of the software process models beforehand but this course still managed to teach me a lot more. It was surprisingly to know about the Waterfall model being misunderstood as presented by the author in his paper. Also, I enjoyed the TedX video choices as the course content. It kept things interesting.One thing that stood out to me was how the delivery of content is ordered to show the differences between different process models and agile practices, in a crystal clear manner. I am taking a lot of good information and can confidently suggest or identify a certain agile practice as a solution. Thank you to all the people who made this course possible!",5
94782,This course is very objective and accomplish the basic objectives of anyone that need a better understanding/revision of concepts about software processes and good practices,5
94783,The course encompassed all the important aspects of Agile Practices. It was a fun and engaging learning experience!,5
94784,"Very good course. Clear and experienced teachers/facilitators, very good reference resource and explicit and efficient videos with a good method including task to fix the learned topics.Complete and organized course structure for incremental learning about software process models.",5
94785,"Very good course. A lot of information for beginners, but it will surely provide a good foundation on various software processes. To get the best not just follow the videos, try to read or at least check the resources provided in different modules. And don't worry, if you can't remember all the info, the goal is to digest the concepts, not the data.",5
94786,"Well done, easy to understand",5
94787,Well structured and presented course. I enjoyed the course. Thank you,4
94788,"knowledge-based, no skill-based work at all which is weird since the capstone is skills-based",3
94789,"Very informative and helpful, all the are well explained.",5
94790,Great introductory course!,5
94791,Very interesting and useful.,5
94792,Very clear explanations and right to the point.,4
94793,I feel as if this course did a great job of building on the intro course. The resources have been tremendous! I find that I,5
94794,"The content of the course was pretty good, probably lacks the practical usecases of it.",4
94795,Very helpful!,5
94796,Lots of material covered and very usable.,5
94797,Very useful course. I recommend it everybody,5
94798,A great continuation of the Specialization. Testing and peer review was thorough and appropriate.,5
94799,"The scope of the course is interesting, the objective is ambitious and the structure is fine, but the contents and quizzes are very often off-point. A specialist should go critically through the scripts and make a thorough review of the contents. Affirmations are most times not justified at all (""incremental prototyping will yield a feature-rich and robust software""). The quizzes some times ask about things which have nothing to do with what was explained before. The contents about SCRUM are presented eight times partially through the introduction and here. I know it takes a lot of time to prepare this material, but clearly that last effort for quality was not done.",2
94800,"The knowledge acquired with Software Process and Agile Practices will completely change the way you deal with your daily routine. Thanks to this course, now I have a better way to manage and deal with projects.",5
94801,Good learning tool and reemphasizes the basics that we forgets most of the time!,5
94802,"Great introductory course on popular software development practices. Some peer reviews could be added in this course to make it more interactive. The course has become heavy on theory side and lacking practical side. However, it is a great place to start learning basic software practices. I, personally, learnt a lot from this course and I would highly recommend this course to all the software developers out there.",4
94803,Course is awesome but the final 36 questions are really a headache.,3
94804,All courses of U of A are excellent and easy to understand. Thanks a lot.,5
94805,Lecture presentation is very very robotic. It's hard to follow the lecture without proper diagrams or examples.,1
94806,"Great class, very hands-on and practical. Applying it every day in my PM practice !",4
94807,"Very useful, both covering theory and practice. Entertaining and fun.",5
94808,"Good, basic overview. They pronounce Kanban wrong and it drives me a little crazy.",4
94809,This was a very well prepared course. The information is complete and well structured.,5
94810,"This a great course. I have studied Scrum, XP, Lean in passing. This course gave me a better understanding of these methodologies, and affirmed what I know.I have worked with small software development teams in the past. From this course, I can use a framework in which to understand how our team works, and how we can improve/modify our practices.",5
94811,Very informative and practical course.Thanks faculty and team.,4
94812,5/5 if there were more pictures and diagrams of the methods while they were talking to better visualize.,4
94813,Pretty good overview of Agile Process in detail.,5
94814,The lecture just reads books.,1
94815,"I did an audit only, but the lectures were excellent for the level of understanding I was aiming for. I thought the analogies were well understood, and the presentations were easy to follow and interesting. Both lecturers made it easy to focus on the material and there weren't many things to distract the learner (i.e. no distracting background or awkward speech). Very well done, I think.",5
94816,"A good overview of the how, what and why of processes. Will make you want to jump onto the next course",5
94817,Very interesting overall view on the different processes and methodologies of software development.,4
94818,Very helpful.,5
94819,Very well explained the teachers go through all the details.I am satisfied!Thank you!!,5
94820,Really HQ course!,5
94821,I like the clear explanation provided in the lectures by Morgan and Bradley.Morgan also answered my questions pretty promptly and gave great practical solutions.,5
94822,They summarize in a very convenient way the various Agile Software Processes and Practices,5
94823,It is a nice course.,5
94824,Nice course with plenty of useful materials.,5
94825,Very good course. Explain the agile practices and methodologies.,5
94826,Great!,5
94827,Really good course.,5
94828,Really helpful course.,5
94829,This was a great learning experience! The course covers the basic concepts of SDLC processes very well.,5
94830,i have just completed the first week of this course and i found it interesting and informative ...as a system analyst i would like to invite all S.A and BA to enroll this course especially if you are new in this fieldI am excited for next week class :),5
94831,"I really like the company narratives. For this very overview presentation, it would be helpful to see more of these.",4
94832,Brilliant survey of popular methodologies along with their comparative analysis,5
94833,Very good overview of different software management tools,5
94834,Good topics,4
94835,"This is a PHENOMENAL course. The very first week of lectures may seem like they will not go into enough detail to be useful, but this is only to set up a foundation. They absolutely elaborate into the perfect level of detail to be successful. would HIGHLY recommend this course/specialization.",5
94836,Good starting point.,5
94837,Great overview of Agile Software Development Processes. Good foundation for the entire course.,5
94838,good course,4
94839,Could have been more practice than theory.,2
94840,Excellent overview - particularly of the development methodologies!,5
94841,You learn a lot of things and new techniques.,5
94842,Examples would help distinguish the nuances between the processes for example the use of the Microsoft daily build. Great comprehensive course otherwise.,4
94843,it was nice,5
94844,Excellent introduction to the landscape of methodologies and development regarding Agile software development. An actual look into the future with LEAN is also very informative as these practices are popping up more and more in the workplace.,5
94845,Good material.,4
94846,Very good introduction to agile processes and practices.,5
94847,Very good course taught by very positive and skilful professors. Recommend,5
94848,It was good but so introductoryInstructors just reading the documents,3
94849,The course is good but the end of unit quiz are not accessible unless you pay.,4
94850,very well conducted. Nice overview of the theory and practices. Would have been good to have some examples and case studies (more like the Microsoft daily build.),4
94851,"That was really great course, thanks!",5
94852,"One of the best coursers I have seen on Coursera so far. The video production quality, course structure and content is extra ordinary compared to other courses that I've seen so far.",5
94853,Good sessions,5
94854,It was too bad to not permit the students to perform the quizzes! Only if we pay for them! I thought the payment was for the certificate!,1
94855,Very nice content and presented so nicely. Must read and highly recommended course for all managers and business analysts.,5
94856,"The course laid out the concepts pretty well but if one had access to the materials, the lectures were not really necessary to understand the concepts.This was because the lectures were pretty much a re-reading of the materials and more importance could be placed on creating scenarios where the processes would be applicable. This would be a far better use of the lecture time than trying to combine the two and not doing a good job of either.",3
94857,"It's a fantastic course !! Simple and complete, could be a ""must"" for every Software Product Manager. Thanks a lot.",5
94858,The explanations and examples are very good.Thanks.,5
94859,A great course,5
94860,Excelent presentation of the many practices used in sorfware development this days,5
94861,Great course!,5
94862,This is a very good lecture to introduce the Agile software development process. It's very clear and the length is good for me. I like it very much! Recommend to all.,5
94863,Definitely worth sitting in this course! I'm not in IT but I definitely came out with some wonderful tools and tricks to add to my PM bag.,5
94864,It was like someone is reading a book for you. there was no need to watch videos. It wasn't even helping your memory. Just 2 instructor standing still in front of camera and reading from a file in flat voice.,2
94865,"Good overview of agile practices.If you're doing the specialization, they say you can take courses 2 & 3 in any order. Technically that's true, but my recommendation is to do them in order.They refer to course 2 in course 3, and the difficulty of assignments decreases if you do them in opposite order like I did.",4
94866,I highly recommend this entire specialisation. It's clearly taught and requires your practical application throughout. I've learned a great deal and thoroughly enjoyed the process. Many many thanks Uni of Alberta.,5
94867,Perfect!!!,5
94868,Could be more in-depth (e.g.Kanban part...),3
94869,Awesome! I really enjoyed this course,5
94870,Excellent course !!! I highly recommend it !! ;),5
94871,Great course for becoming more process oriented and having a more detailed understanding of multiple product management processes.,5
94872,I really liked to do it,5
94873,Without reading the course notes it quite difficult to understand the lessons and pass the tests,4
94874,"This is so interesting. Even though I knew some of the concepts, I think the lecturers were able to organize an amazing course and I could learn some new concepts.",5
94875,"What other way to learn and understand Software Processes and Agile Practices than to register to Software Product Management at the University of Alberta, Canada.I rate the course 5 star.",5
94876,"Very concrete and useful information, very well explained.",5
94877,It has been very useful as an introduction to agile concepts,4
94878,"Simply listening to somebody talk about the fundamentals of Agile, with no practical work whatsoever, could be an extremely boring experience. Thumbs up to the two people delivering the contents, because they both managed to do that in a very engaging way. Thanks!",4
94879,Course is full of useful information and instructors are easy to follow.,5
94880,Topics discussed are well organized! It is perfect for reviewing SE concepts.,5
94881,"Thanks a lot for all the instructors and the team behind this course. The content quality reminds me of some agile principles.Simplicity of the words, the illustrations, the examplesFeedback from students through the discussionsTechnical excellence and good designWelcoming change (I've witnessed commitments of the team to improve some points in the content)I'm thrilled to go on and look at the next coursesI say Bravo !Smail",5
94882,Covers the most used processes and practices!,5
94883,nice course to refresh memories,5
94884,Good course to get the fundamental learning....,5
94885,"Good explained course with interesting information about processes and practices in agile. Not too detailed, but can give you an overall overview of what a process implies and what are the general practices used in software.",4
94886,"Interesting review of many of the theoretical aspects. It completely lacks practice though. No exercises, no real world scenarios...",3
94887,"The lectures were done well. The tests should have more ""Real world scenario"" questions, then just asking about specifics terms used in a given process",3
94888,"Excellent professor, very detailed explanation of different SDLC practices. Extremely helpful for IT professionals.",5
94889,Really good course.,5
94890,"Great production values and more ""meat"" to it than the intro course. I like the scenario based questions. It still seems a little light on content, but the content that is present is good.",4
94891,Nice overview of different practices and methods.,4
94892,Nice and useful,5
94893,I really enjoyed the course. Clear and concise. I recommend for the beginners as well for more experienced people as a great refresher.,5
94894,A very detailed course. Recommend it to all those interested in becoming practitioners of Software Product Management.,4
94895,"The course way OK, but it had some flaws.It was very general and could have gone into more detail, but that was intentional, I guess. No big deal. Then again, the difficulty was way too easy and the quiz questions should be tested for test wiseness. What I disliked the most: The way Scrum was introduced and mapped to the role of a ""product manager"" was very confusing.Still, not a bad course though.",3
94896,Great Course,4
94897,Good course. Information is concise and well structured. I have completed the assignments spending approximately 1.5 hours a week on it and found the course difficulty to be easy.,5
94898,This is a survey course of software development models and as that it is fine. Did expect more depth though.,4
94899,Very good course !,5
94900,Good definition for extreme programming and software process models.,5
94901,This course give me numerous knowledge about Agile and the related knowledge. Thanks for creating this course.,5
94902,"Very, very well written course. Thank you!",5
94903,Very insightful and professionaly prepared.,5
94904,"I really enjoy this specialization, it is srtuctured very well, lot's of useful information and it is explained very good.",5
94905,"Informative, well done. Absolutely helpful.",5
94906,Simple & encouraging to learn more.,5
94907,This is such a great course and I am sure that it will impact my career greatly. I am glad I decided to pursue it on Coursera.,5
94908,Awesome course.,5
94909,"The lean and scrum helps me a lot, I wish there could be more user cases, product manager could share more insights about the product. Anyway, it's really helpful.",5
94910,Nice and clear presentation of the topic. Good course for everyone who might want to work with software development.,5
94911,"great overview of modern development practices, thank you",5
94912,"I found this course interesting, yet I would propose to rename it to ""Introduction to Software Processes and Agile Practices"". Topics are covered well, but they don't dive deep.",4
94913,A wide range of approaches - didn't bog down - sharp and info,5
94914,"The course is a very good explanation of what processes are, as well as a nice introduction of the agile approach to manage software projects.",5
94915,"Very informative and cleared up a lot of questions I had about processes, agile, scrum, kanban and how they work together.",4
94916,Its a wonderful course for enlightening anyone on the basics of Software process and Agile. Very good lectures!!,4
94917,great review of How to ...form start to done ..must learn or relearn,5
94918,Very Good CourseThank you,5
94919,"Interesting, ""agile"" and complete. The quizzes are of a good level.",4
94920,very good course,5
94921,Great course!,5
94922,"Great course, taught you the in and out of Processes, Practices and Methodologies to ease you software development.",5
94923,"Well taught Software Processes and practices. I liked the way the course was conducted, the quiz and video lectures.",5
94924,It is a wonderful course for software process management.,5
94925,A very well organized and presented course with relevant content.,4
94926,"Great course, now i have a really clear idea about the many choices in processes to make a better software in a quality and timely manner. I´m enjoying so much this specialization, Thanks!",5
94927,"very bad, useless course. Just listing the names of the methods and practices.",1
94928,Great course. I have learn a lot. Thanks to University of Alberta and professors have teach this course,5
94929,Thank you very much,5
94930,"Excellent course!Very easy to follow, and the notes were really good! I believe that this course delivers critical knowledge to any Business Analyst, Product Manager and Product Development Manager.",5
94931,Very Good Course,5
94932,"Nice introduction to Agile and Lean methodology, should probably cover more about Lean",4
94933,Mapping of software product manager to scrum master is IMHO not correct. Some misunderstanding by introduction of scrum (e.g. customer is not a part of the scrum team).Preparing of a part of an university course by a bachelor of computer science....,2
94934,I think it would be better if more real-word case studies are provided.,4
94935,Pretty broad introduction to some different processes. Gave a pretty good intro to agile methodologies. I like that there was some depth in the explanation of Kanban. Looking forward to continuing in the specialization.,4
94936,"Good introduction to many core concepts. Overall video and presentation quality are quite good. The course is not particularly challenging, so if you are concerned with time requirements, I don't think you need to worry.",4
94937,"Want to know about different methodologies, practices and processes in software development? don't miss this one. Clearly explained, thought provoking quiz and memorable graphics. Absolutely topper.",5
94938,Amazing Course. So very enlightening and so very well taught. The quizzes help to reinforce the material learnt in the Lectures.The quiz question made it so that you had to constantly think critically to answer real world problem scenarios.Would recommend it to anyone to gain a good understanding of Software Processes and Agile Practices.,5
94939,"Good course! Excellent to reinforce my knowledge on scrum, xp and agile. In the end however I think that the content was somehow repetitive, but this not change the quality of the course.",4
94940,Very useful.,5
94941,"Quite educational, bravo team!(thumsup)",5
94942,Interesting and useful course!,5
94943,It is no surprise that a course that emphasises quality is of the utmost quality.An enjoyable and valuable learning experience.,5
94944,Simple and effective teaching. Learning a lot from this course already.,5
94945,It's really helpful & great,5
94946,good but abit brief,4
94947,"The teaching process is very elusive and subtle. The explanations in this course are very unclear and tricky, even some of them are omitted, which makes this course very hard to understand.This course seriously lacks of logic. It's more like a heap of formulas thrown together and what the teacher do in this course is just to read them.",1
94948,"A lot of the practical materials in the courses are taught by the TAs, most of whom tend to speak in a monotonous manner and failed to teach at a pace that matches the difficulties or complexity of the content. There is no slowing down or speeding up for hard-to-grasp or easy materials. Also, it seems to me that they are delivering the lectures by reading line by line from a piece of paper.",3
94949,"very excellent, providing other aspects for research.",5
94950,very good !excellent experience !,5
94951,"Interesting and well organized , like it ~ xiexie nong ~",5
94952,a little bit difficult for the beginners,5
94953,Interesting course and wonderful speech. Requires some mathematic and computational basis.,4
94954,Very good course!,5
94955,"Learned many things from it,Great!",4
94956,I enjoy going trough the process and understand the system of self improvement in todays markets.It helps me coach my clients through the process,5
94957,"This course was helpful in motivating me to do some serious introspection and providing tools to assess my soft skills; my core values; my career interests; and my competencies. I especially liked the first three weeks of the course, where the instruction and exercises were clear, coherent and inspiring. In weeks 4 and 5, the instruction became a little muddied, but I still found the exercises very helpful. Overall I would definitely recommend this course to anybody struggling in a job search or wanting to make a career change.",4
94958,THANK YOU!,5
94959,Very shallow,2
94960,This course was uninspiring,1
94961,"This course is fantastic in helping job seekers learn to view themselves and the jobs they are interested in, from the perspective of the hiring authority. Also, will provide skills to be successful on your career path.",5
94962,"Great course with very useful enlightening on career brand management and very useful tools and links to know yourself more, to better prepare for career development.",5
94963,Great... Thank you for building a quality course.,5
94964,"amazing course a must take one, changed my life",5
94965,"Lots of value in the course. If the tutors didn't read from their notes, but instead would speak freely into the camera, it would be even more engaging and personal.",4
94966,An excellent wake up call any time in your career.,5
94967,This is one of the very useful course.,4
94968,"Just started, but it gives a great insight to branding",5
94969,Very good course. It has transformed my approach to career development. Before I was not sure about how to manage my career and I was trying to learn a lot of skills without thinking about how to use them. This course has provided me with the tools and methodology that I need to be more strategic and focused in my career management.,5
94970,A must for anyone in the work force or about to enter!!!!,5
94971,"An absolutely great course that transformed my career development efforts from uncertain and uninformed to focused and well thought-out. The topic lectures were relevant and practical and CDLs were challenging yet inspired deep introspection and evaluation which assisted to internalize the concepts and convert them into actionable tasks. Many thanks to Amy and Drs. Forte, Valeri, Rutigliano and Beckem.",4
94972,"Great lectures, very insightful and very useful.",5
94973,This course was very practical and provided lots of useful templates and materials. I'm looking forward next courses on this Specialization. Thank you Professors.,5
94974,Visuals were not great. Content was a bit irrelevant,2
94975,"Good course with so many tools for career self management. I think this is an essential course for those who are entering the workplace environment, those who are entrepreneurial, and those who have experience but want to develop and advance their skills. Thanks!",5
94976,"Good general guidance, Richard Sellers was the most useful. Interesting how even established in a career can be considered a ""generalist"".",3
94977,This course along with the specialization is one of the best I've ever taken and it is greatfully helpful for anyone in any major with any career experience.Give yourselves a chance with this eye opener course.,5
94978,Interesting,5
94979,"The course offers insight on how to get prepared in the dynamic labor market and how to be in control of one's life. It's an eye-opening course, and therefore highly recommended for everyone wanting to be in control of his/her life in the turbulent labor market, and being in charge for career self -management",5
94980,"I am so eager to be part of the class, Thank you for this Coursera",5
94981,These professors took a brave approach to discussing topics that are avoided in the classroom but merit discussion. It was a well balanced course that doesn't shove you into a particular corner but instead offers multiple viewpoints and questions for you to consider about your own personal beliefs.,4
94982,"learned a lot, great course, do it again",5
94983,"Excellent course! As close as it comes to a course on the meaning of life. I've learned so much and loved every minute. This course has helped me to know myself a lot better, and to understand others, and the human condition in general. I feel as if it's also helped me to solve a couple of life's great mysteries, and at the same time introduced me to a lot more great unsolved mysteries. Everyone should do this course (all three modules)!",5
94984,"I really hate to see the course end. It has been an interesting journey. I wish to thank all of those connected - Corrsera, Ruthers, Professors Daniel Ogilvie and Leonard Hamilton, and all the guest speakers for this great course presentation.It was well introduced, assembled, staged and orchestrated. It's about time such subject matter that has such a profound effect on societies and peoples lives be analyzed.",5
94985,"Really enjoyed this part of the course. I am very grateful for the opportunity to learn online and I am impressed by the quality of this course.I like the format of the three units for Soul Beliefs as I think this works well with the amount of material. However, it can take some time to have assignments marked by peers. Patience.My heartfelt thanks to the Profs and everyone involved.",5
94986,"Thanks to the beautiful and long journey of reflection and beliefs about the soul, we do together with Prof. Daniel Ogilvie and Prof. Leonard Hamilton.I really congratulate you for your animus, interest and great provision.Sow concerns ...to reap virtues.Sincerely.",4
94987,"More awesome work by the Hamilton/Ogilvie team! I have learned so much during this course and I'm a 66 year old research program manager for a group exploring the interactions between the environment, health and",5
94988,"Fascinating. The combination of disciplines, Psychology, Anthropology, Archaeology, etc., made this an enlightening class, one which made me think. I also appreciated the dry humor, which always aids memory, at least for me. A truly enjoyable experience.",5
94989,"The ""Soul Beliefs"" course seems to try presenting things in an unbiased manner yet they cannot hide their bias. If the intention was to hold up various beliefs in the past then try to shoot them down, they partially succeeded. Most rational believers however could still hold onto their beliefs because the arguments were very weak.A better title for the course would be ""why there is no soul"". That way going in a student would realize that there actually was a hidden agenda.",1
94990,"Great, but with less new content than Units 1 and 2.",4
94991,This course worked better as a guide than it did as a course. I learned very little from the lectures and had to do most of my learning on my own. One of the assignment even explicitly told students they would have to go learn on their own.,4
94992,"Excellent introductory course for data analysis in Python, specifically using Pandas library.I learnt a lot in a short time. Assignments are not easy to solve, they make you think hard, explore more on internet and on user forums, thus making you grasp the topics in depth. This is the best starter course for anyone seeking a career in Data Science using Python.",5
94993,the course is really precise and explained well,5
94994,"I appreciate this specialization's patience to begin teaching data science with such a thorough introduction to handling data in python. The lectures are concise, with 80-90% of my time time spent on the assignments. The creators of the course have a clear understanding that most of a data scientist's job is spent cleaning data, and it's incredibly important to get the practice offered by this course.",5
94995,Good class challenging but fun!,5
94996,"The course doesn't feel complete, the information and techniques used for assignments can be found completely online through documentation and instead this is merely an exercise for doing basic analysis through documentation rather than an explanation of python through data science (which is what I anticipated)",3
94997,"frankly, it takes a lot of searching information on one's own, outside of this course.I raked my brains for the most of Saturday and Sunday and finished two last assigments although I still don't feel strong in pandas, neither there is much material left here for me to come back and review something step by step in a systematic way.",4
94998,Its a very good course to start learning for data analysis which can work as a foundation to learn more in data science and machine learning.,5
94999,Great course! Some of the homework questions seemed a little ambiguous but I was able to find clarification in the course discussion. All in all I learned a lot.,4
95000,"Very dense, well taught, examples and assignments help in the learning process, I've done many, many Coursera courses, this one in the Top5",5
95001,This course is excellent for newbies in learning data science. It gives a comprehensive description about data science .,5
95002,a decent introduction into the world of python dataframes via the pandas library,3
95003,"Tasks sometimes a bit tacit to understand what exactly should we return and in what format, but course is great!",4
95004,Great tutor and interactive build up from fundamentals to the very challenging concepts..,5
95005,Good course to get you thinking about python,4
95006,"Content was generally well covered. One improvement could have been slightly better examples of how there are multiple different ways to solve the same problems; the instructor would often allude to this but would just advise the student to read through the pandas docs, which could be non-intuitive at times.",4
95007,Very Good!,5
95008,"Very informative. Would be interested to see the correct way to complete many of the assignments, as I'm sure there are more elegant ways to complete them than I used",5
95009,"The explanation and content in teaching video is too brief for the assignment. It cannot not provide sufficient concept and knowledge for student to complete it, especially who not familiar with pandas.",3
95010,Nice course for beginners,5
95011,"Much harder than I thought. Very in-depth introductory learning of python.Preferably better if you allow scripting in .py because notebook is rather heavy and hard todebug while assignments..Hope you cover a bit more in detail with language structure, as well as give hints for solving assignments, since many parts were pretty above course level.I would say the assignments were hard even for an R practitioner learning python like myself.",5
95012,"just begun, but so far so good. I will update the stars as the weeks progress!!",1
95013,Good course the assignments were challenging,4
95014,Very good course with some challenging assignments that put to test many of my python capabilities,4
95015,"What I liked best about this course is the programming assignments. They encourage you to look out for more resources, since the video lectures themselves can only cover so much of ground.",5
95016,Much more difficult assignments than taught in lectures,3
95017,The teach and assignment are not in line in difficulty levels.,4
95018,This is a great course to learn about Data Science techniques. The profesors explains all the topics clearly,5
95019,"course material good, mentors very very helpful and active , as mentioned in one of the posts the expected output of an answer in pictorial form can help students a lot , and the assignments were a little on the tough side , even being from a programming background i had to put a lot of effort to figure out silly mistakes and complete this first course but a nice experience , keep it up coursera.",4
95020,Learning at its best through this course,5
95021,One of the most useful courses to start a career in the field of Data Science. The assignment were really challenging and interesting,5
95022,"Very difficult if you are unfamiliar with python, but achievable. Assignments can be frustrating to get just right for the autograder, but you learn important subtleties in the meantime. Cannot wait to complete the rest of the courses in this specialization!!",5
95023,Assignment 4 is difficult to understand.,5
95024,Very helpful for data analysis.,5
95025,Gave me a thorough understanding of Python and Data Science. Thanks to the team! :),4
95026,Nice course! Pushing you to practice and lert you act on your own to find accurate results.I thinks that this is the best way to learn if you want to start a career in Data Science,5
95027,This is an excellent course which should be taken when you want to practice Pandas!,5
95028,Good introduction to pyhton and data science,5
95029,"Great learning experience with a very good teacher. A little bit difficult but, hey this is science!",4
95030,I've never used python before so the first module was great for teaching me the basics but the learning curve ramped up really quickly and I was really struggling with some of the more advanced functions at the end.,5
95031,Lectures are too fast!,3
95032,Unorganized and not very useful. The main goal of the course is for you to use Stack Overflow.....SAVE YOURSELF $,1
95033,Nice introductory course for using python in datascience,5
95034,Very Good Course,5
95035,Great introduction to data scientist!,5
95036,"In my opinion, the assignments problems could be more clearily explained, I think it could be improved for next sessions.",4
95037,Recommend this course to people new to Python and want to learn basic data science techniques quickly. Very inspiring lectures given by professor and very helpful instructions given by mentors and teaching assistant.,5
95038,"Very poor course, badly taught and terrible value for money. The lessons are brief beyond any form of reasonableness, the teacher seems completely unconnected with his students. There is no detail at all and no logical progression. I took and passed this course with a view to doing the specialisation but I'm not going to waste any more money on University of Michigan courses. I've found similar courses on other platforms which cover the same material. The assignments were awful, in some cases they covered material to be presented the following week, in others the questions were wrongly stated and did not match the output from the machine grading. The machine grading itself gave you no clue as to where you went wrong. I'm not talking about the odd question here or there, I'm talking about consistently throughout every assignment. I don't normally, in fact ever, leave bad reviews, I usually just chalk it up to experience and move on but in this case, the course was so bad, I had to say something. I've done two other courses on Coursera with Rice University and the difference to this course is huge, while I would wholeheartedly recommend the Rice Intro to Python courses, Don't do this course, it is not coherently presented or graded. The mentors in the forum tried their best but even they had to admit the grading system was riddled with errors. Absolute rubbish, avoid and spend your money elsewhere.",1
95039,A worthy course to begin Python & Data Science with. I enjoyed learning Data Science in Python.,4
95040,Nice Course.... it makes me a little bit stressed cause same bug and other. But I'M REALLY ENJOY this course. Can't wait next course in this series. :),5
95041,"Definitely one of the best course I have taken so far.The course started with refreshing the python basics and then it's a deep dive in to the ocean of Data Cleaning tasks.Special Thanks to Dr Brooks for keeping the course straight forward and simple. All the concepts are made very clear during lecture and the assignments are a perfect application of these concepts.Even though assignments are challenging, will feel the sense of accomplishment on completing these.Thanks to the entire course team for the course.",5
95042,Lectures are very informative. Liked assignments because they were opened enough to seek for a new information by yourself - that's a thing everyone must improve.,5
95043,"I got the opportunity of learning Python Basics through Dr Chunk's Python for Every Body, Now through this course I got the hands on experience of working with Data in Python using NumPy and Pandas, ya Its awsome journey overall. Thanks Coursera and University of Michigan for bringing us such a great Learning opportunity.",5
95044,"Learned so much for this course. Very intensive and challenging, but also a lot of fun.",5
95045,very intersting course in which you can learn many thing about cleaning data etc,5
95046,This is the good course for learning data science,4
95047,"I highly recommend this course for data science beginners like me. python is such an easy language to learn and this course showed how easy it is for data cleaning , etc.",5
95048,"Very good course, forces to do a lot of self study.",5
95049,Pretty good,5
95050,"Sometimes need more words in tasks, so it can help understand it better.",4
95051,More programming details should be included.,3
95052,"Dreadful course. Instructors saw no value in presenting elements of course that would help learners complete the assignments; rather you are sent off to teach yourself about uncovered techniques needed to complete the assignments. From some of the posts from previous students on GitHub, they resorted to deriving the answer from another means (Excel?) and simply providing the answer as a constant value, in order to receive credit for particular questions. Not exactly sterling knowledge transfer, from instructor to student! This course should be presented as a challenge course to people that have already learned Python Pandas from some other venue. (BTW, Pandas documentation is also dreadful, as of this writing.) This is definitely not the way to learn Python for Data Science if you are a busy professional software engineer. (Wish I had a good recommendation as an alternative.)The only positive aspect of this course is the challenge to work with defined datasets, to complete specific tasks, during week 3. (This was as much time as I could afford to allocate to this course.)From a 40+ year software engineer, with doctorate in CS, a part-time instructor at a private university, with a very challenging technology job in a multi-national corporation.",2
95053,"The course is a great course in terms of the knowledge and experience of the instructor and the helpfulness of the staff. I gave it 2 stars for two reasons.1) The videos are deceptively short. In MOOC instructional design, you normally design short videos because the attention span of an online learner is tends to be much shorter than an in-person university student. However, in this course, even though the video is short, it is really 5-10 times longer because they speed over the equations and teaching so fast that you have to pause and replay and rewind and replay several times while trying it yourself. So the timings are not truly accurate. If you were actually teaching it in a classroom with actual students you would go much more slowly. In this case, I wish they were more honest with the times by actually typing the code in real time while teaching. I would have preferred a lecture to make it more digestible.2) The hardest thing for me about the course was the fact that instead of practicing computational thinking within data science (decomposition, algorithmic thinking, etc.), I was really just searching on stack overflow for how to put it into python. It's poor instructional design to only teach somethings and expect students to complete assignments without giving them all the tools they will use in the assignment. It would be ok if it were an accidental mistake, but this seems to be purposeful. This happened not just in course assignments but sometimes even in mid-roll video-overlaid quizzes where the answer was something not explained or taught or shown. This was really strange to me and caused a huge amount of time to be spent searching online or trying mid-lecture problems to no avail. It cause all the timings of the course to be off (#1 caused the video timings to be severely off and #2 meant that the course assignment estimates were HUGELY miscalculated). Good instructional design would mean that the professor should show all the tools one could use to faithfully complete and achieve the assignment. For some reason that was avoided again and again in this course.Great material though. I loved learning. I just wish it were better structured and supported and that I learned more about the work rather than just searching online for how to write something.",1
95054,This is a good course if you have had some experience with the Pandas module in Python prior to taking the course. Pandas is a very powerful module but it has a fairly significant learning curve. There are all sorts of free Pandas tutorials available on the web. I highly recommend familiarizing yourself with the basics of Pandas prior to taking this course or you will probably struggle.,4
95055,"This class was super useful. I had a minimal amount of base Python under my belt and some data analysis in R, but this course really got me off the ground using the pandas data analysis library for Python and Jupyter notebooks.",5
95056,"Solid explanations of the basics of python and pandas. Strong emphasis on self-learning in assignments, which may be difficult for those without background in programming.",5
95057,"Thanks for the course. A few things that can be improved:1- The video material was very short. I expected same amount of teaching like homework, but it's more like 30 minutes versus 7 hours every week. As a result it's mostly googling and copy-pasting code, which I'm very sceptical if solving issues this way will enter my long-term memory. Probably next time I will need to look it up again. I'd prefer if the videos were the source of knowledge instead of stack overflow and the forum.2 - As an experienced programmer but being new to Python I found it difficult to load the data. I was not aware that the files are available on the server and can just be loaded by read_csv(filename.csv). Instead I tried to load the files from my local drive, which worked, but not for the grader. Then I tried to submit it offline which also failed. I wasted half a day on this. I suggest to mention quickly how the online and offline assignments work, in particular in how to load data.3 - The feedback from the grader is usually not telling much. It was often unclear to me what was the expected outcome. I think a screenshot of the expected answer for the more advanced questions (first few rows+columns) would help a lot and save us a lot of suffering.",2
95058,great course for a start! at the end its all about how you practice from what you leanred,5
95059,"hard assignments, lecture was not enough to cover assignments.",4
95060,Wonderful course,5
95061,Everything is good from the teaching. The Only Problem I faced is with the Jupyter. Code works fine in my Computer but the Kernel dies in the Jupyter. I also had a problem in importing some functions in Jupyter.,5
95062,Amazing course. Really easy to follow along as long as you put the work in and study you'll be fine!,5
95063,"Unclear assignments, lectures are brief and sometimes unclear. Spent more time trying to understand what was being asked than actually learning.",1
95064,"Really disappointed with this course to the point I'm quiting -in spite of having paid for the grade-. It reminded me of my days at the university where I found being a great scientist/engineer didn't mean you were a great teacher. And this is the real problem, even things that should be easy to grasp are difficult to understand -just the opposite of prof. Bill Boyd who makes learning a joy-. Because of this I would only recommend this course if you already have an intermediate level in Python.",2
95065,Very good lecture.,5
95066,I really liked the course and how it introduces Python to beginners. Kudos to Coursera and University of Michigan!,5
95067,"Very informative introduction to Data Science using Python. Well presented and explained by the instructor. I will recommend this for python beginners and intermediate learners.I enjoyed it, hope you will too.",5
95068,"For me the course's biggest value-adding point is to simply ask us to Google everything on Stack Overflow to complete all the assignments, which has almost nothing to do with the course content. The assignments are also badly designed. In the discussion forum you can see lots of confused / frustrated posts. The TA's and mentors are clearly under-resourced to answer all our questions. The videos unfortunately don't teach us much either. The professor + TA's a simply reading off a teleprompter, and they're rushing through everything. I've done some amazing courses on Python also offered from Uni. of Chicago, but this course has been a big disappointment unfortunately...",3
95069,This course is a joke. Contents is very very poor. And you will have a lot of problems making the Assigments.,1
95070,"Hope that lecture videos could be longer. Anyway, it is a great course, I really learned a lot.",4
95071,It was a great learning experience.,5
95072,The video classes are informative and very clear. The exercises during the classes were thorough and allowed me to apprehend the concepts at a good pace. My only problem were the auto-graded exams. Sometimes the questions are not crystal clear and the auto-grader isn't intelligent enough to discern between a logical mistake and some detail about table formatting. Fortunately these problems are discussed in the forums and usually one can get clues on what they can be from the mentors.,4
95073,"A very challenging course. The assignments are the best part of the course and it takes up a lot of time and patience to complete them. The discussion forum is fairly engaging and the mentors are very responsive. Overall, this course is a big boost in the field of Data science",5
95074,"Excellent overview of the topic. Lectures are well delivered, if a bit terse. Assignments are well designed, and the mentors in the discussion forums are very helpful.",5
95075,The content is good,4
95076,Lecture content need much more coverage.,5
95077,"Great course and valuable information, but frustrating autograder.",4
95078,Please provide more lectures. We depend on self-learning more than lectures in order to pass.,3
95079,Good and necessary introduction to Python. But especially Assignement 3 regarding cleaning the data should be improved. It´s good to know how to clean the data but it´s confusing when Q1 is apparently correct but actually it´s not. Mabye it would be better that Q2 - Q13 based on a new dataframe which is correctly by all means.,3
95080,Very well designed course for Data Science beginners,5
95081,"The course content is great. However, basic knowledge of python programming language is required. Since I didn't know python coding rules, I really struggled for a while. Maybe, basics of python in additional resources will help a lot of learners.",4
95082,"I feel the videos could have been more instructive.However, the level of assignments is incredible! I learnt a lot more from programming assignments of this course than videos.",4
95083,I would like to have seen more detailed teaching on Hypothesis testing and how it applies to python before tackling the final project.,4
95084,Awesome course for those who want to kick start a data science career.,5
95085,Will be useful to take the Phyton Cpurse before this one. You only learn when you do the assignments.,4
95086,"The Assignments are really tough and need a lot of self study. However, If you are a person who learns by doing projects this course is the one.",5
95087,"I learned so much. However, the lack of support when I got stuck made it a frustrating experience. I would not have been able to pass without the discussion forum tips. Even then, it was a lot of mucking in the dark and assignments took longer to complete than they should have. I'm glad I took the course but it was not designed for someone at my skill level. If the discussion forum was organized in a better way, it would have helped -- I had to scroll through pages of text to find the right tips to identify my mistakes. Sometimes the question requirements were oddly or ambiguously phrased and I misunderstood the expectation for the function being tested.",3
95088,really interesting course and professors are great,5
95089,Nice course about pandas.,5
95090,"Instructor gives minimal examples and says ""go look on stack overflow"". Then he proceeds to assign problems that don't really cover what the slides, lectures, or examples were on. If I all I was trying to do was just read some docs and look on stack overflow I wouldn't need to take this course now would I?Poorly translated and cryptic instructions for assembling furniture are better than what you get here.",1
95091,"I really enjoyed this challenging introductory course, I cannot wait to continue the specialization",4
95092,Difficult. I cannot recommend this course to everyone but just technically minded people.,3
95093,This course relies almost exclusively on self learning of the details of pandas. It would be greatly improved by examples of how to use pandas to solve problems similar to the assignments.,3
95094,"Doesn't provide resources to complete assignments.Telling students to ""go to Stack Overflow"" is a serious red flag.Independent learning is an incredibly valuable process, but this course felt more like a series of challenge assignments to do once you've learned Pandas on your own from another source.",2
95095,Thoroughly enjoyed. It was set at a good level – enough was left in the assignments so they felt like an actual accomplishment.,5
95096,"Great introductory course to python. Decent novice-level videos but great assignment quality. Definitely takes up more time than expected, especially if you aren't well-versed with python syntax.",5
95097,"requires too much self-learning,could be overwhelming to those who lack concrete python basics",4
95098,"Good course, challenging as well.",5
95099,"Very well designed course , it compels students to go in-depth for assignment work.Very helpful Teaching staff as well",5
95100,"As a python newbie, I found this course challenging yet so much fun to learn. Dr. Brooks presented the lectures in a very organized way and made them easy to follow. If you have experience in R, you probably would pick up Pandas real quick. Students are expected to devote a lot of time into the assignments and try to find the answer on your own. But with all the great tips and clarifications from our diligent mentor Sophie Greene, it's definitely achievable.Will take the other courses in this specialization and definitely recommend it to anyone who's interested in data analysis.",5
95101,"Learning this course gave me confidence and more interest in exploring data science, I plan to explore further through the next couple of courses.",5
95102,I enjoyed the way the Professor presents the concepts with real and interesting examples. The exercises during the presentation was an extra motivation. And I appreciated that each assignment was well selected with real data. The mentors and staff in the discussion,5
95103,Awesome Course,5
95104,"Although, i had some basic knowledge of data science before and also i did some programming in python, yet i find this course comprehensive and practical.",5
95105,"Felt like this course was trying to pack a lot of information into only four weeks. I find Python to be a very frustrating language - at least that's how Pandas feels. Compared to R the syntax is dreadful. And I found myself digging through help files and FAQs to find ways to do what should be the simplest things - like accessing values in a data frame. The Pandas help documents are not written for beginners, but written in a mathematically precise manner that makes them inaccessible. (Their preference for 1-letter variable names is unhelpful.) Stack Overflow is much better but it's a crap shoot as to whether somebody has addressed the exact issue that is bothering me at any given point.One final issue: it would be nice to see model solutions. I understand the difficulty in having online solutions available for an online course, but I found myself writing what I considered to be inefficient code fairly often. Would love to see slicker ways to do these tasks.",4
95106,Very good course,5
95107,Need clearer examples and explanations. Slides summing up concepts or used functions will be great.,2
95108,"This course is difficult. It stresses a lot of core skills in pandas and python. I wish there was more instructor support for the times that code just doesn't seem to match up with the grader's expectations. There is still a question in the course that I am relatively positive I answered correctly yet did not receive credit. Overall, the format is incredibly well done and the use of Jupyter notebooks makes the tasks very approachable.",4
95109,"Great intro to data science and some of Python libraries for it.The exercises can be quite difficult, especially if you expect to have all the answers given to you during the lessons. In order to solve some of them you have to search the web to find the commands you need, which I think is a good thing because it teaches an approach useful in real scenarios.",5
95110,Thank you for the very elaborate and very beginner's course. The difficulty quickly ramps up and the questions within an assignment often differs substantially. This can be seen as both a pro and a con.,4
95111,it is a 5 star course but I am giving it a 4 star primarily because of the pace was very very fast for me...,4
95112,"Great material and presentation! Please work on question clarity, especially in the last project. With as picky as the grader is a little extra specificity would have saved me a few false starts.",5
95113,"Excellent pandas course. The exercises were extremely challenging, but helped me hone my pandas syntax a lot. Definitely worth the time if you're interested in becoming a business intelligence analyst or engineer.",5
95114,"Some topics are very difficult since many of the concepts are outside of what was thought in the lectures so one has to do a lot of research outside of the website. This takes up a lot of time and is way more than the estimated time for each part of the course. I did find excellent help available on the forum. Overall, a very challenging yet fun course.",4
95115,"This course is very challenging but worthwhile. Having experiences in data analysis with python, I still feel the assignments are really hard to complete. BUT it is really worthwhile, and I improved my skills in python A LOT! The auto-graded system is AWESOME! I sincerely recommend this course and really appreciate the work of the teaching staff!",5
95116,"Great Course,very practical. I would improve the examples and increase the number of exercise during the lectures instead of just fastly presenting the pandas functionalities.",4
95117,A very interesting and useful course for those who want to learn how to clean data in Python.I loved the opportunity to work directly on the notebook as I was listening to lectures.I think that more emphasis should have been put in the pros and cons why and how of using the pandas lib. functions in order to accomplish tasks.Assignments were very instructive and well explained by staff in the Discussion ForumMany thanks to the staff and to U. of Michigan for the course.,4
95118,The course lessons could have been more specific and provide more explanations on many topics that are later required in the assignments,3
95119,Fast-paced course requiring time to finish - but totally worth it!,5
95120,"The whole curse relies on the automated grading system, which is still a little sloppy. I think it would be useful to have one notebook or cheatsheet with all the important functions. And also, I personally like to have a reference assignment that was completed by the instructors. This could be provided before or after the course, but the way I really learn is by reading other peoples code and seeing ways to code problems. Thanks",3
95121,Fantastic course with challenging assignments. Wish there were more handouts to explain some of the key concepts and the grader was better informative of the errors.,5
95122,Great course!! I've enjoyed the assignments very much - from my part it required a a lot of individual investigation / reading through posts to find possible solutions but that's only fair since this is an intermediate course. It was a fantastic experience as the assignments felt like real projects. Thanks for everyone making this course possible! Daniel,5
95123,The course instructor could have been more elaborate with the examples. I felt there was a wide gap between the exercises and the course material.,3
95124,"the knowledge touch here is really good. however, the speed is a little bit quick. I paused and go back and forth usually.the last introduction of assignment 4 is not clear. I took quite a long time to figure what to use to calculate the price ratio and what to use to run ttest.",4
95125,I really enjoyed this course. For me it was'n easy at all but I still say that you find the right way to help the students without make the assignments pointless. Thank you so much for this great learning opportunity!,5
95126,A must do course for budding data scientists,5
95127,Great introduction to the world of data science. Instructor does a great job of explaining the content with easy to follow examples. I highly recommend taking the course,5
95128,I really enjoyed the experience. The videos are precise and give examples for the materials discussed. However it feels a bit sparse on the overall length. On the other hand the exercises test the knowledge acquired through the course and self learning.,5
95129,the content was more focused on just pandas librarycouldve included matplotlib and scipy also,4
95130,Excellent introduction to data science with python. Thank you,5
95131,"I overthought some of the homework (the forums will tell you to not do that) and wasted much time going a bit too far cleaning data, however my own hubris aside, it was a good course. I've been working in NNs for some time, but wanted to use more formal data science tools on top of that and add something to my CV. I wish these tools had been around when I was in grad school... le sigh.",5
95132,"Honestly, it was a good crash course into data science in python. My 3/5 star rating comes from the fact that I think their could be more content / examples shown in the videos. The videos were a good start into the assignments, but I had to spend hours reading on the internet to really understand enough to complete the course.I liked what I saw in the videos, just wish there was a little more substance.",3
95133,"This python is mostly an introduction to the Python Pandas API. It teaches everything by example, but at very fast pace, and the videos are really just preparations for the assignments, which can easily take more time than specified.",4
95134,right course.,4
95135,"The submission tasks are too time consuming. In the other hand,forces the student to search about answers by themselves and use the techniques taught on it's full extension.",4
95136,"A bit short, but good info. I wish you got access to an optimal code for each of the assignments once you submit yours and pass, so you could see how you can improve.",4
95137,"The course was a very efficient intro to using Python to get data from various simple sources and the different structures that can be used to hold and manipulate the data. The course starts with the intuitive methods to solve problems and then introduces more complex and process friendly alternatives to demonstrate how creativity and knowledge of Python can be used to generate elegant and efficient code. The auto-grading of assignments can be a little maddening as the correct answer needs to be formatted precisely as is expected or else it will be counted as incorrect. The good thing here is that it forces you to fully understand the data types and data, the bad is it can be frustrating not knowing if the answer is wrong or just the format of the answer. Admittedly, I feel this effort forced me to become a better Python programmer.",5
95138,"Great course, requires much self-initiative because not all useful methods for the assignments are covered in the videos. Sometimes Assignment Questions are not described very clearly.All in all I enjoyed the course very much :)",4
95139,Not for beginners.Level of difficulty increase very fast.You need to dig external reference sites and use discussion forums in order to figure out some assignments requirements.Overall quality is very good.Should have some better tips and validation scripts in order to help debugging assignments.,4
95140,"Very good introduction to Pandas Series and DataFrames for Data Science. Fast paced course with good supplementary materials. The homework is progressively challenging. Sophie the Teaching Assistant is particularly helpful in the forums. I don't recommend this course for those without programming or python scripting experience. Also, the homework exercises took me significantly longer than the estimates projected, but I budgeted about double the time and was able to complete the course on time.",5
95141,"Only 37 minutes of video, average per week. Really nice, pleasant video, but don't expect to learn how to solve the problems, because there is little connection from the problems to the videos.Teaching assistants are hard -working and knowledgable and each has a different way to do things.Very little in the way of effective educational design.But they do create useful questions to answer, if you are stubborn enough not to need actual instruction.The estimate of time required is woefully inadequate.The best thing you can do is lookup Brandon Rhodes on Youtube. He will actually explain Pandas. Expect to invest about four hours in his videos and still have questions. Use the course forum extensively — only there will you get a hint of how to do what they ask.Google and Stack Overflow: that's their extensive list of references.",3
95142,This course was really worth paying!!!Thank you for providing this course!,5
95143,"I found that the videos weren't entirely helpful when tackling the assignments. I had to outsource most, if not all, of my inquiries to external sources (read: stack overflow). Even simple things such as advanced indexing, such as multi-indexing, was unclear. I understand that not everything can be covered, but I feel that basic things should be. Other than that, I enjoyed using the Jupyter notebook, and thought this was integrated very nicely into the coursework.",4
95144,"The course was helpful in presenting typical problems in data science, but the lectures showed you examples in one area of pandas and the assignments asked questions in different areas of pandas. I found the assignments frustrating and spent much of my time trying to understand what they were asking rather than actually solving the problems.",3
95145,Excellent course. It really motivated me to work very hard to make all assignments on time,5
95146,"I enjoyed and found all of the lectures helpful, but lack of feedback after submitting assignments was a real problem, especially for the last assignment. A simple response of ""this was answered incorrectly, points not awarded"" isn't very constructive and was often frustrating. Bugs in being able to submit the assignment were also frustrating. I spent a good amount of time trying to fix my code, thinking it was incorrect, when in actuality the online submission was just not working.",3
95147,"The course content and assignments are pretty good at covering the fundamentals of how to manipulate data in python, I did learn a lot that I can see my self applying practically.Where it falls down though is the assignment auto-grader. It's immensely fussy (as I understand it has to be), but the assignment instructions are often very vague and don't sufficiently explicitly define whats expected. This means you spend more than 50% of your assignment time debugging and recasting objects and getting very frustrated whilst doing so.I would recommend this course, but I do hope that the course administrators pick up on this feedback and make the assignments clearer in the future.",3
95148,"An excellent course, though I think some of the assignments should be a little more guided",5
95149,"From my poitn of view more lessons are needed, achieving exercises require a deep search on stackoverflow and other courses. That shouldn´t be the goal of the course, I expected the lessons to give enough knowledge to fullfil the questions of the exams",3
95150,Is challenging and you learn about a bunch of different aspects of pandas. Never forget to take notes about what you are learning and review them later.,5
95151,It provides plenty resources and requires a lot more effort from the learners of point of view.,5
95152,"Great course in hands-on experience with Python on data analytics. Before the class, I took a intro class to Python in my school covering basic commands, and thought this Coursera course would be kind of easy. But it turned out to be a very intensive one. I take more than 6 hours to complete the homework.",5
95153,It's a great course! The assignment is amazing! It takes me several hours or even one or two days to finish it. I have to say the assignment is really valuable. Professor Brook is also great and the video is greatly filmed. It's worth taking if you have already learned some of python and want to know more about python in data analysis. I have already learned the book Learn Python the Hard Way and played with python for a while before I take this course.,5
95154,Very helpful for beginners who wants to learn Data Science with Python. Will recommend to go with this course. Thank you team for giving nice teaching. Very Grateful :),5
95155,Perfect to get hands on with python programming for data science purposes.,4
95156,"Challenging assignments, clear and concise explanations, learned a ton!",5
95157,"This is an amazing course. The teacher (Chris) is fantastic, extremely clear and a pleasure to listen his classes.",5
95158,Great course. You should really work hard to pass all the assignments. Tons of practical expirience in pandas. Looking forward for the next courses.,5
95159,Fantastic course. Quite challenging but it is really worth for people looking to learn python and some of the key concepts in data science. I definitely will continue with the following python courses part of the specialization,5
95160,Good intro to Pandas and assignments are well designed,5
95161,Good lecturers and interactive videos,5
95162,"While the course was great, the Jupyter notebooks and the background shells gave me several unnecessary errors. While this was a smaller issue, I think the practice Notebooks should be somewhat in line with the assignments. I struggles on Assignment #3.",4
95163,"It is an interesting course. After taking this course, I can make use of Pandas, numpy in python. In addition, I have learned some interesting knowledge about statistic. Thanks Prof. Christopher Brooks and TAs.",5
95164,"Very good class - but it does require quite a bit of outside study - reading up on stackoverflow. But after this class, the student will be able to have a very hand set of tools/skills to tackle datascience projects. BTW, python with the interactive notebook is very popular in actual datascience projects in the commercial sphere, so this class can be leveraged directly in the real world",4
95165,Great introduction to Pandas.,5
95166,This course was fast paced but the material was interesting and not to complex. I can only recommend this course to anyone interested in Data Science and who already has a basic knowledge of Python.,5
95167,"The course was structured well, there were a lot of assignments that really help with learning pandas. The lectures were ok, could've been a bit longer though.",4
95168,Best course to learn Pandas library and some basics of Python required for Data Sciences and Machine Learning.,5
95169,Awesome introduction.,5
95170,"I took sometime to get used to the auto grader, but after that it's fine. All the staffs are very helpful in clarifying the questions and provide code to debug my codes. It was awesome!",4
95171,"Really amazing course, I leaned a lot about pandas, how to manage and clean data and extract value out of that. I've learned a little about statistics, specially hypothesis testing.",5
95172,Very good and practical course. Challenging and enjoyable assessments. Thank you very much indeed.,5
95173,"The course is fast paced and the videos do not cover all of what is necessary to know to pass the assignments. However, this is not a problem as all the necessary references are given. The problem is the way the programming assignments are designed and the automatic grader, which should definitely be improved. Some times you spend hours to figure out what is wrong and you finally find out that you have a precision error because of using a library function instead of another (same purpose) or you spend our to manipulate a Pandas dataframe to respond to the specifications, except that all that time is wasted as the grader will accept the first version even if the index does not respond to the requirement (for instance). So, if you want to take it, prepare to fight with the grader. Positive point: Excellent help on the forums, you will not be left alone.",3
95174,"The course is very good and very demanding. But the assignments estimation time were, for me, really completely out. I used much more than 3 more times the suggested ones.",5
95175,The course's content is great but the fact that we have to search by our self's for the tests was the best for me.,5
95176,"Great Course! I learn a lot about Python, Pandas and other areas. Looking forward to taking the next courses.",5
95177,Nice course. I really liked how I could proceed at my own pace. The computer-graded assignments were very helpful and the Forums were good sources of info.,4
95178,"This course has greatly helped my understanding of not only some python, but pandas as well. My only suggestion to anyone that wants to take this course is to make sure to allocate as much time as possible to it. They give estimates as to how long it should take you to complete a week's worth of material, but this can vary highly from person to person. Overall, I enjoyed!",4
95179,"I do have background in OOP programming but not Python. But I do also programming in MATLAB. I chose this course to learn more about technical skills to do research in data mining, data science, and machine learning. The instructor is fine but the lecture note is not really helpful. Students need more clear written information than just lecturing in Video as referring to lecture notes as needed would be more efficient. Each week assigns one programming assignment consisting of multiple problems. I don't think the shown expected time to complete each assignment is totally unrealistic. It took tremendous time to complete and at least to pass it. One good thing is that as far as you complete it within the session, there is no penalty and you can get the passing scores. However, all the programming is graded by the autograder which has a lot of bugs. For example, the exactly same solutions that was passed by the autograder as correct previously are graded as incorrect in the next trial. The staff people try to help but I totally don't understand their approach in that 'this may help but I am not sure if the autograder can accept it'. I believe they try to fix the bugs and use the 'trustworthy' autograder so students can rely on the feedback provided the autograder. We are not learning how to make the autograder not generate errors. I believe many of students are taking this course to improve their career performance. In my case, I am working as a full-time while I am taking this course. Due to the lack of time and the inefficient/faulty autograder, I took a lot of my precious time. I got passed this course with 95 and will continue taking the rest of the courses in this specialization because I already paid the whole specialization package and supported by my company. But I believe the staff team should improve the technical aspects so students can save a lot of their time. Also many of the programming problems do not have the sufficient level of clarity. For each problem, there should be an example so students do not have to spend too much time to understand or guess the solution. I found many inconsistency in the solutions although I guessed it by spending a lot of time to pass this course.",3
95180,"Challenging, awesome. Working through the assignments will really teach you Pandas, which makes Python scripts much more efficient. I'm already using the things I have learned at work.",5
95181,"Course lectures were good, tho at times a little too rapid. The python text appears and disappears too fast to digest, I did a lot of pausing.The early exercises were good, but later ones were finicky. I would prefer more intermediate steps to confirm we're on the right track. In particular the last (huge) exercise was frustrating, just being told I've got it wrong with no feedback on why.",3
95182,"This course would be great if you are experienced in Python or any other programming language. The title ' Beginner Specialization. No prior experience required.' is very misleading and if you do not have any experience, you will struggle a lot especially to complete week 3 & 4 assignments.It makes you think and requires a lot of self-study, which is a good way to enhance our knowledge and skills, however assignments are way too challenging for those who are 'beginners' or have little real-world experience. I would not recommend if you do not have much confidence in your programming 'experience'.Having said that, teaching team is great - very knowledgeable and supportive.",3
95183,I would recommend the coursera online training session need more improvement. Please look at this youtube video. this will give you some fair idea what do i mean.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0AWyzVMf54During the session speaker need to be visible on top corner and they need to present with more examples during learning this will help and learn fast.I struggled a bit following your videos going back-and-forth with the given materials.I also struggled solving the assignment due to confusing questions. Not much clear what is required to solve the problem. it would be helpful to provide some hints for each assignment.,2
95184,"Assignment 3 was absolutely ridiculous in the sense that the implementation of pandas functions depended on data cleaning in the first step for which there was no help . No response from peers or moderators on my queries. Had high hopes when I joined the course. I feel cheated now. Because of some issues with the data cleaning step, all my following answers were incorrect and I couldn't pass the course in time.",1
95185,Fantastic overview and support,5
95186,"Overall this was a great class. The programming assignments were the most valuable part of the course for me and were good practice for wrangling data with pandas. I did find some of the assignments asked questions in a way that were confusing and it was difficult to debug the answer based on the automatic grader. However, I'm looking forward to when the rest of the specialization is available, as this looks like a good track!",4
95187,Very Useful and practical,5
95188,"The course is very good to introduce people with pandas usage, however, the autograder and little data issues on the assignments costs a lot of learning time.",4
95189,"In my humble opinion, the Python ramp-up in week 1 is not sufficient to effectively complete weeks 2-4. This course necessitates a bit more practice in Python. The lectures are cut-and-dry, and I recommend frequently referencing them when completing the assignments. I spent about 1.5x the listed time-to-complete on most assignments. On the flip side, I gained a lot of knowledge by putting forth full effort.",3
95190,Very good content. Challenging assignment that force you to learn more yourself rather than just apply what you've heard and forget it in 10 minutes.,5
95191,Please make longer tutorial videos. Sometimes it becomes too fast to cope up with.,4
95192,"The course is great and learned a lot from the assignment! I just feel some of the content is a little beyond me since it took a lot of time to finish.After finishing the assignment, I feel myself haven't done enough! So if possible, I hope more exercise can be posted here :)",4
95193,Nice course for understanding the basics,4
95194,"""Course"" is very self-directed. There are very few exercises, and there is minimal feedback on those exercises. No attempt is made to reinforce learned knowledge over time (e.g. spaced repetition) nor is there any definitive list for what knowledge should be gleaned from this course. Emphasis is placed on the student's teaching themselves and learning through experience with no attempt to actually understand the learning process or rest the course design on a scientific basis. Standard filler course for an empty education system.",2
95195,Overall a very nice introduction to Python. Sometimes the checks for the assignments were a little annoying. It would be way easier if all the checks would be published from the outset.,4
95196,"Congratulations, folks! This course is amazing! I learned *a lot* on it! =]",5
95197,Course is good. I learned a lot. But the pace of teaching is very fast.,4
95198,Assignment time estimations were way off in my opinion.,4
95199,Thank you once again Courser and Team for their generous contribution towards students across globe. The teachers and courses mentors specially Sophie who was awesome during the assignment for her nice clarification. This course was challenging but fun.,5
95200,"Overall, this course is tough for me. In my opinion, the course title is not suitable, which is ""introduction"". The word ""introduction"" generally means something basic and fundamental. However, the level programming assignments in this course is between slightly medium and very hard.Furthermore, the assignment instructions are not clear enough, i.e. what steps need to be followed to complete each question. So, it needs time for me to find the way or solution in the discussion forum. I know in each week forum, there is one discussion specifically for assignment (i.e. Assignment X Tips), which is good. But, I think the forum is not a good place, since we have to find it meticulously the information and what we want to find is spread out, not in an easy to follow order.Moreover, I do not think the lectures and the assignments are well synchronized as there are many things in assignments that are outside from the lectures. I mean, it is ""too many"" new things in the assignment. Although it is a great way for the students to search and enhance their skills by themselves, in general, the assignments should at least reflect the lectures.Lastly, in my humble opinion, this course is not appropriate for someone who is new to programming and has not been familiar or mastered any programming languages, though the title is ""introduction"".",2
95201,"Don't think this should be classified as ""Beginner Specialization. No prior experience required."" Need at least some coding experience.",4
95202,"Very well structured course. I would really appreciate if there are more video lectures. For someone like who is not from CS background, self-study topics can get really difficult.Apart from that loved it.",4
95203,Great course for beginner in data science,5
95204,"please provide the complete 5 unit details . I could see only this unit is open for past many months. I paid for all 5 unit money already and not in a position revert back and get the money. Could you please help me out to understand when this courses will be available if not in near future , why are they taken money before the course is not ready to us. Quite disappointing experience.",1
95205,Hard to do,5
95206,"Very rewarding course. As many others have mentioned, the learning curve in the assignments is steep and the time estimate of 4 hours/week is unrealistically short. It took me about three days of full-time work to finish the course. Great into to working with data structures in pandas, data cleaning and basic statistical tests in python.",5
95207,Was good but the support in the forums could be better.,4
95208,"Basically assignments were unclear (I had to do lots of resubmissions), but everything else was fine.",4
95209,Very interesting subject and data science skills are definitely currently in demand. The only thing that bugged me was that the grader didn't give much feedback on anything you did wrong. On the flip side the mentors did a GREAT job (kudos to you guys). The discussion forums were vital and they were really well moderated.,4
95210,"Nice course! there is only one suggestion I want to send you, the video is so short that we can not learn the pandas more in the course. So I hope you can provide more detailed videos thanks.",4
95211,"This is very helpful course, my skills horned after undergoing through this sessions. My expertise and style of using python for data analysis changed. Articles and group discussions about P-hacking made me to realize the pitfalls, I may enter once I get addicted to proving my hypothesis correct. I got an idea, what better I can understand; when data speaks.I am waiting for next module of this course. Please start it as possible.",5
95212,"This course taught ma Pandas and Hypothesis test, which are very useful in my study and future work. For example, I learned how to sort values, merge tables, and reset indexes. And most parts is like SQL.Lectures will give some basic knowledge of the contents for each week. And this course also provide enough related documents, including codes and slides in classes. And it also has subtitle, which helps me a lot for my understanding.When I was doing assignment, I still need to search more information from internet and learn by myself. I think this is a great way to help me know how to solve problems by myself. I think it is also a little bit challenging for a beginner, so I suggest beginner to learn some basic knowledge before taking this course.",5
95213,Perfect courses! With a lot of opportunities to practice and to learn from do questions by yourself. Mentors and staffs are also kindly to answer problems.,5
95214,"Good introduction of working with tabular data in Pandas dataframes. I've learnt how to access columns, rows, and specific values in a dataframe. How to transform the data. And how to merge dataframes together. The assignments are a lot of do-it-yourself by reading documentation and Q&A sites. So you're forced to read a lot, and learn more than actually necessary. Teacher and mentors gave hints on the discussion forum which helped. Could have been better if part of the solution is given. E.g. answer = 0.0073.........64 without actually giving the full answer. I also think the automatic grader should give an explanation or example of a correct answer when the assignment is answered correctly. It would have been better that way, because I could review the strengths and weaknesses of the methods I used to get to the answer.",3
95215,Really good introductory course to Pandas. Teaching stuff was a big help and forums are very active and informative. Very good work. Area of improvement: The estimated timings of completion are too optimistic :),5
95216,The duration of the course (4 weeks) was ideal. It was manageable as a part time course. The tests helped me a lot to practice and learn the concepts deeply. The forums were very helpful in clarifying the questions. The video quality was great.Many thanks for this great course which is made available online for free for all the world.,5
95217,This course will be a great start for people to know about data science with python and get familiar with few simple data.,4
95218,"I certainly learnt a lot through this course. The hands on oriented approach of this course works wonders for those who intend to dig deeper and improve their Python programming. The lectures are crisp and clear, but the main learning happens while doing the weekly assignments. Each assignment forces us to go search for content beyond what has been taught in the lectures and in this process we find new things. Also, the lecturer informed us about some good reference books for individual learning. I look forward to taking part two of this course.The mentors in the discussions forum are quite active and helpful. The forum was of big help to me for clearing the assignments. The only flaw I found was that the autograder does not clearly define our mistakes and that's where the mentors come in and explain in the discussion forum. This part could be better automated.Finally, I believe that a prior introduction to Python programming is an essential prerequisite to this course.",5
95219,The assignments were challenging and cool. Lot of self-study needed to crack them. The lecture videos could have been a bit more interesting.,4
95220,"I have struggled a lot during this course to complete the assignments. It is hard, it is well taught and you learn a lot!",5
95221,"The lecturer is excellent, the forums are active and useful and the exercises are a good mixture of challenging and enjoyable. A very good course overall.",5
95222,The course material is very short and precise. Previous knowledge of Python is helpful. This course serves its purpose as an introduction to Python libraries and how they are used in the field of Data Science.,5
95223,"Too much focus on databases and database operations, rather than data science.The assignments are too difficult for a 4 week course.",2
95224,This course was over all okay. My primary complaints are that I felt that the class moved too quickly and relied too heavily on students to teach themselves through the Pandas documentation. The Pandas documentation is really only so-so and it would have been nice to have more guidance through the course materials.,3
95225,"Very nice Course, You will Learn about how to effectively use Pandas Library for Python and how to treat DataFrames in that ambient, there are nice functions and methods for parsing. The Course is very fast pace, I only have time on the weekends (some of those), so I had to switch dates two times. Also, some materials are very fast, so If you are new in Python, got to be sure if you have mastered prior concepts of the course (Week 2 depends on week 1 and so on ...). A large part of the course involves your own research in Python Docs and StackOverFlow page. As I am an R user, some things are intuitive (and maybe more easier for me to do in R), several of the things in comparison I thought: ""Wow, but this is so much easier on R"", but at other times I saw the power of Python for parsing tasks or webdata that in the R require too much memory or are more complicated to obtain. R have the problem to treat everything like an object and guided by vectors, but at some parts that makes understand coding details more deeply, at least for me. I still think that the documentation of R the best there is for my purposes, so I will stick with that, but it's great to know how to develop some things in Python, mainly because of my goal of getting some applications to end users. Finally, not much related to the course, but maybe with the change in the platform of the Coursera, the forums seemed a little more confusing and a little more slower than former courses that I took, I think it might have to do with the same course running in parallel on different dates.",5
95226,"The course content is great - Prof Christopher seriously made justice to the content. He is great instructor. He has presented course in right manner, with right speed.Looking for more courses from Him.",4
95227,"I learnt a lot, and enjoyed the process! It was more engaging than I expected of an online course. Excited to go forward with the specialization.",5
95228,"All the ingredients are there, but it would be nice to have more hand-holding given the ramp-up in difficulty in only a few weeks.",4
95229,It was very hard but extremly learnful.,4
95230,One of the best Courses I have done online. Took me back to basics and gave the best possible introduction to python which was beyond my expectations,5
95231,"Excellent course and lot to learn, one of the best data analysis toolkit available.",5
95232,"The course lectures were subpar and didn't cover the material in the assignments. Googling for answers and checking stackoverflow for code is a great way to get tips, but it doesn't teach you the core material. I would have rather had links to supplemental readings that the materials were based on. I would not recommend this course as an introduction course unless you've had significant experience with Python data structures and know how to work with lists, dataframes, and iterate over those.",2
95233,Thanks a lot for your work. It's a great course for data sciense in python!,5
95234,"A lot of the harder questions were unclear or not covered by the course. Many were passed onto ""look this up yourself"", which is fine, but sometimes a different approach resulted in a slightly different answer marked as wrong. The group_by stuff was especially tricky, as it was unlike its SQL counterpart and could have used a better example, eg with a function to split into quarters or group columns. Other than that, very interesting overall and very neat datasets. I would encourage having students check out kaggle.com for extra credit.",4
95235,"Really good course with challenging assignments. However, the grader has some issues, for every assignment I had to spend more time trying to figure out how to make the grader accept my answers than actually solving the problems.",4
95236,The assignments were very well made and the discussion forums were also very well moderated. I will highly recommend this to any of my peers who are interested.,5
95237,The material seemed a bit hurried at times..but overall a great learning experience and the assignments were truly helpful,4
95238,Great Course!,5
95239,"Two stars because I have found poor explanations of assignments. I finished the course without being very clear what I was asked, and I lacked more feedback when one of the tasks is wrong. The teacher and the videos are very good.",2
95240,Excellent course in one word,5
95241,"Good course, if a bit fast paced, expect a great deal of searching through documentation and stackoverflow, but it is to be expected from an intermediate level course.",4
95242,I never thought this Data Science course was going to be that challenging and exciting at the same time. I have really enjoyed this first course and I am about to enroll for the coming courses. Well explained concepts and very comprehensive videos. Congrats!,5
95243,Looks like it's prealpha version of what it might be.,1
95244,"Advanced Python! It was hard, but I enjoyed it!",5
95245,Excellent to get started with data science with Python. Very good instructor and lots of hands on exercises. Kudos!,5
95246,"This course was great to get a start in Data Science. I thought the lectures and the course notes were very well presented and served as a good resource for the assignments. The use of Jupyter notebooks was especially helpful. I found the course forums also very helpful in debugging my code. I have some previous experience with Pythons so the level of the assignments was easy enough that I didn't feel overwhelmed, but challenging enough for me do a lot of independent study.A criticism I have is that the Jupyter notebooks kept logging me off so saving assignments regularly failed and I had to redo work often.I usually don't pay for courses on Coursera, but the quality of this was so good that I will definitely continue with the specialization.",4
95247,"Last assignment was *painful*: Poorly described instructions, outcomes/outpu; the grader was opaque and largely mute.",3
95248,"good when it's been around for a while, else frustrated with a lot of unclear instruction and no support.",4
95249,It needs some previous experience with Python and if possible with Pandas,5
95250,"It's great course, but the assignments are so hard to data science beginner.",4
95251,the homework is interesting,5
95252,Briskly paced course for those new to Python and/or Pandas. Good weekly exercises that ended with a real life data analysis exercise in week 4.,5
95253,Thanks for introducing Pandas and Anaconda!,5
95254,The course is well structured and clarity of teaching is impressive. The assignments have a good mix of easy and progressively tougher questions that build on the syllabus and challenge you to manipulate data in your own way. I can warmly recommend this course to anyone who wants to begin manipulating and analysing data using python.,5
95255,"I learned good materials for Python from this class. The assignments are good. Only one comment: the writing of the assignments can be very vague and at times it is hard to understand. Overall, I like the class.",5
95256,"Hard course, but good ROI.",5
95257,"While this was one of the better courses I've done on Coursera, the start date of the course was changed without any indication of when it would begin. We've also been waiting months for the next course in the specialisation to begin, again without any communication. This was a good course, but I would recommend people wait until all the rest of the courses are available before starting this course and beginning the specialisation.",1
95258,"This is a very well organized course with a great introduction to data science. In a short time of 4 weeks, it covers Python basics, Padans library, and some very basic introduction to statistics in data science. The assignments are well desgined, and the mentors are very helpful in the forums. I highly recommend this course.",5
95259,"It was challenging yet fun to learn this course.Last but not least, the http://stackoverflow.com is really helpful. I highly recommend it to anyone who want to learn Python.",4
95260,This course has helped me equip basics knowledge of Python Pandas.,5
95261,Good at setting up the framework for the assignments. Google/stackoverflow is your friend. The course materials presents the information but you will have to go and actively learn a good amount of material. I enjoyed this approach but some may be looking for a more contained course.,4
95262,"a little more help from the video lectures is expected. The assignments required a lot of self study which is great but at the beginning, every assignment looks daunting and discourages a little. Although the forums helped a lot in getting through this course, but the majority of the roadmap to take, and all other lessons should be included in the videos.",5
95263,First two weeks are great. The third week becomes a bit disporportionately difficult. The autograder is very inflexible.,4
95264,very practical and efficient - high useful skills gained per time spent ratio!,5
95265,"Useful and concise lectures, interesting exercises!",5
95266,"Although I learned a lot in this course, I found the lectures and assignments to be much too different from each other. I would like to see assignments where you must practice what is learned in the lecture. For myself, I feel I learned 1 set of concepts from the lectures and another set from the assignments by spending time on stack overflow and the pandas documentation. Both are good but the lectures and assignments did not ""flow"" together as I would have liked.",3
95267,The instructor was great . The assignments were good and helped me learn a lot.,5
95268,"It is a great, brief introduction to Pandas. I think it is ideal for someone who already knows Python but doesn't have much experience with Pandas. Lectures are well structured with quizzes interspersed. Homework assignments are also well structured and use real data.",5
95269,Very good course with lots of hands on experience. Jupyter Notebooks are very good learning tool.,5
95270,"This was overall an excellent course, I very much appreciate everyone who has made this happen. However, the very last question of the very last assignment I found to be substantially more difficult than everything else, by a very large degree. Because of that one question I ended up moving my session twice and nearly dropped the course. https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-analysis/discussions/weeks/4/threads/1Fkg-ryCEeaIRw7T1E5tHA/replies/vK-NSNNOEeaBeg5U4yHl7A is what finally got me over the hump. The instructions were not very clear to me but the price ratio calculation was the key to success. My guess is that missed it somewhere. Anyway, thanks! I will be moving on to the next course.",5
95271,"I can see a couple of problems in this course. How to access and change elements in a data frame (especially the use of loc and iloc) is not explained very well and I believe there is an error in the slides. The second thing is that I have found more powerful methods in pandas documentation, for example assign() or nlargest() and nsmallest(). This is not really a problem if one of the ""hidden"" purposes is to push students to actively search the docs for what they would like to do.Work load for the assignments is just fine in my opinion, not too little, not too much.Overall I am satisfied.",4
95272,"While the material is undoubtedly useful, te structure of the assessments is not very helpful. For example, in week 3 we are asked to create data frames from input files: these are presented in descending order of complexity for cleanup. Furthermore, the points for most of the questions are 6.66, despite what are very different demands fore each part. In the final week, the dictionary of state names is counterproductive in answering part one (some state names are region names) and one can either get 100% or one fails the course (as one question is worth 50% of the grade.)Some of the autograder feedback is so terse as to be downright infuriating. Add to that frequent issues with the notebook crashing and much of this coursework was an exercise in unnecessary frustration rather than increasing enlightenment.",2
95273,Great hands on course!,5
95274,I learned in this course that pandas is a way deeper rabbit hole than it appears on the surface. However rather than teaching me pandas this course mostly just helped me verify that I was learning pandas. The questions in this class need more scaffolding. I ended up skipping most of the in-video questions because I felt that the work I was investing in getting them correct was not teaching me much. More scaffolding could fix this.,4
95275,Tough course if you are new to Python and do not like to browse stackoverflow. Otherwise a great course with challenging assignments.,5
95276,It is not easy for me to complete this course but I learned A LOT! It is truly beneficial if you don't give up. Yes you need to search a lot of python skills online to complete the programming assignment.,5
95277,"I'm an experienced data analytics professional re-skilling after being laid off. I really enjoyed this course. Professor Brooks' lectures were engaging and clear. I found the assignments to be great practice, although they were challenging for my level of programming experience.I strongly recommend having some skill with python, particularly pandas, prior to taking this course.",5
95278,"Excellent class, well-designed programming exercises with autograding.",5
95279,Finding optimal solutions for the assignments would have helped more,4
95280,"Skills acquired when finishing this first course are very useful and applicable. However, lectures and assignments are almost unrelated. This course is nothing for people who are new to python.",3
95281,"The content and the instruction were great: just the right level for someone like me with experience in other programming languages a decent familiarity with stats.There were a few glitches with the auto-grader for the assignments, but nothing to onerous.",4
95282,"I found this course useful since I had no previous experience of Pandas or the statistical features of Python. I have programming experience and feel I would have found it quite a challenge otherwise, but not prohibitively so. Chris is great at explaining things in an accessible manner, and I'm very much looking forward to going into more detail in the rest of the specialisation. I would have enjoyed a little more focus on statistics etc and a little less on the mechanics of the library, but understand why it had to be approached this way.",3
95283,"This is the best ever of all courses I took on MOOC. It was well prepared, Clear, fast paced, informational, challenging, and with appropriate exercises. Sometime I had to pool my hair to get things done and spent a lot of time, but it was fun and worthwhile. I thank Christopher Brooks and the team.I",5
95284,very tough to catch up.,1
95285,Very nice introduction to pandas for those who already know how to program.,5
95286,"Excellent course. As someone that knows R and is trying to learn Python, I found it to be just what I was looking for.",5
95287,This would be the best course I have in this platform. Videos and readings are very brief but homework are fantastic!,5
95288,"This was a very helpful course in getting comfortable with using the pandas library and different concepts in numpy in data analysis. The fact that the instructors and course materials do not give you 100% of the tools to complete the assignments is a plus. Every data analyst and programmer inevitably will have to rely on self-guidance.This course by itself may not be immensely useful in the professional world, but lays a strong foundation for the student to focus more on plotting, analysis, and conceptual learning, rather than on code.",5
95289,Great course. Challenging homework.,5
95290,"I have learned an amazing amount about Pandas and how powerful it is for Data Science, Thanks Peter",5
95291,An excellent introduction to data science using python,5
95292,"I liked that the course was very assignment-oriented. It had a good structure and interesting additional readings. However, for people who are not familiar with pandas library it may be very challenging to pass assignments. This minimal guidance, I believe, results not in a better understanding, but in confused students writing bad code and spending hours not understanding online documentation. Overall, I really liked the idea and content of the course, but not how instructors approached the self-learning part.",3
95293,Great introduction to pandas and the basics of data cleaning and preparation. The video lectures are great and the optional readings are interesting. I had a blast working on the assignments and learned quite a bit. I would recommend this as a good starting point to anyone looking to learn how to use python for data analysis purposes!,5
95294,"Great for someone with intermediate experience in Python. A quick way to learn the pandas package, and apply it to interesting examples. A big thank you to the instructors!",5
95295,Very informative and helpful!,5
95296,Very nice course. Professor explains clearly. Materials are complete and not difficult to understand.,5
95297,"I felt like the test-candidate for a new course. While the course-work and the presentations itsself were excellent, the ""homework"" was a real pain as very often the Auto-grader didn't work and it took me hours to get a project which was correct, to be accepted as the right solution. Cannot recommend it to be honest unless they improve their systems. Also it was said that the other course specialization start soon but it seems they don't and I paid for the full package....",2
95298,The instructor should lower the speed,4
95299,"The course is challenging, and designed to encourage learners to be independent and make full use of the discussion forum. As long as learners do not lose sight of the fact that help is available, they will enjoy this course. But if they lose faith, this would be a disaster.",4
95300,"I really like Prof. Brooks's way of teaching. He developed a very good introductory level course. Apart from some talks about data science in a whole, he concentrated on the preparatory work in this field -- data cleaning. Instead of delving into theories, he paid most of his attention to how to make things work by using python. I actually have a background in C, and I was a bit reluctant to learn python at first since C is already strong enough to attack most tasks. However, I have fallen in love with python now, and I think it is a much more suitable language for daily use especially when your projects aren't very large. Among its many merits, the best thing about python is of course its numerous libraries like numpy and pandas which free us from tedious low-level programming. I am quite convinced that I will move to python from now on.In addition to lectures, I truly recommend you go over extra reading materials. Those articles are very thought provoking. For example, the first one ""50 Years of Data Science"" totally changed my previous view towards this field. It made me realize that data science is not a simple combination of statistics and machine learning, that it is a distinct way of obtaining new knowledge, and that its advancement shall benefit the whole science society.About the assignments, those taught in the lecture are not enough and you should refer to python documents and stack overflow. I think knowing how to solve problems and where to find help is more important than solving problems itself, and that's why I consider those assignments well designed.Finally, thanks to all the efforts made by the teaching staff.",5
95301,"Videos are fast-paced, material is limited (no real slides or extensive doc). Exercises are sometimes not clear in their statement. Activity on the forum compensates that. Exercises are however close to challenges you face in real life. Finally, the start date was delayed and there is no clear visibility on when the other modules are started. So, the course could be better given, provide more material and be better coordinated. I followed one Python course at Rice University which was by far better given.",2
95302,Very nice course with good demonstration and practical assignments.,5
95303,The best course for beginners like me. The way Professor teaches is awesome.,5
95304,"In general, this course is able to introduce the basics of data manipulation in pandas. Exercises are designed in a way that key python functions can be applied. The downside is, I feel like the grading some what less intuitive. For example, in may assignments, student has to import pandas or numpy in each and every function in order to get the score. Another problem when submitting your assignment is that students have to SAVE changes in order for the new code to take effect. Last but not least, the reading of the grading report is unclear. Students may not get the full reason for certain errors, thus creating challenges to improve their homework.",4
95305,Requires most projects to be completed without the videos help. Need to research and find answers elsewhere. Also need to have good sense of python.,4
95306,Great basic introduction to the pandas library and data science concepts,5
95307,It is a very good course for learning pandas.,5
95308,"Very helpful introduction to pandas. I can already think of several applications. The Jupyter notebooks accompanying the lectures were very helpful. The assignments were well thought out, and the TA posted some helpful commentary to resolve some ambiguity in the instructions.",5
95309,"The assignments were tough and they really tested your knowledge of python. That being said, the lectures were absolutely useless. I spent 90% of my time trying to figure out python through stack overflow. The jupyter platform is also very frustrating. For whatever reason, error messages kept coming up as I was trying to complete the assignments. At one point, I lost all my work because of this error.",2
95310,It was a good course where i learned about new and great tools and techniques. I learned how to approach the data science problems using Pandas and Numpy. This would not serve as a great course for into to data science. Background with Database Management and Python really helps. Overall i learn about new and great tools and would definitely require Documentation while using the skills i learnt in this course. Overall Great Job by Professor Brooks. Would love to take more courses by him.,3
95311,Really good course. Provides ample time to figure out things. Does not penalize for slightly late submissions which is good for busy people. Teaches the fundamentals and asks tougher questions in assignments. Does not spoon feed the answers.,5
95312,"Classes moved very fast, especially in the video materials. Functions were introduced briefly without time to digest. While I ultimately did learn the topics through my own research, I feel the class would have been much more beneficial with slower, more indepth explanations.",3
95313,"Content is actually very good, I can feel the content creator and staffs emphasis on real world problems. Projects and Assignments are quite useful, and I can expect to use skills I acquired in my day to day work. However, the most agonizing parts of this course is it requires tremendous of time to do self-study. I spend tons of time on google search, reading docs and go over other people's post on various forums in order to find the right way(sometimes optimal way) to finish the assignments. I understand and accept that self-study is very import to master things nowadays, but I really think gap is too big between what was taught in class and what you need to complete this course, especially for people that has zero data science programming experience like me.I'd rather spend time watching 2 more hours of teaching videos per week that can cover more aspects/topics/tips/tricks than go over lots of docs and posts. I won't deny I learned a lot through this course, but I believe my learning curve can be flatten significantly if there is more class materials available. If the majority of course is spent on googling, what's the point to take it?",2
95314,very practical introduction to Python programming,5
95315,"The course is fantastic! By practicing with the assignments, I improved a lot in python programming. I am now confident in doing data cleaning and manipulation in python.",5
95316,I am an engineer and I use matlab and stata for data analysis and currently taking Machine Learning course by Stanford which is fabulous. I did not like this course for the following reasons:1- bad course design structure2- so confusing and inappropriate sequence3- super fast without providing any intuition4- no fundamental explanation5- course could be longer and spend enough time in each subject,1
95317,A pretty challenging course! I learned a lot and would recommend to anyone interested in advanced python and data science.,5
95318,"Many bugs, lecture content does not cover topics required to complete the assignments, assignment instructions are not written in a clear way.",2
95319,Great course and material.,5
95320,Good hands on projects.,5
95321,"Very well prepared course, good quality video and audio too (some of the older courses have crappy audio)... this class gives you enough information to allow you to research and attack new problems on your own",5
95322,"Great course for data preparation for ML which is sometimes neglected in other courses. Great instructor. Useful assignments. Assignments require research on your own which is good. I would recommend to maybe make the course longer and cover more topics (in-depth string processing etc.), because it felt a bit short. Thanks Dr. Brooks for putting this together.",4
95323,Excellent course. Good classes and the assignment push you to go further!,5
95324,"A lot of knowledge, sometimes too dense. Treats you like an adult and encourages you to look on your own. Very useful.",5
95325,good solid intro to python munging.,4
95326,This course was a good introduction to using Python for data science. I found the coverage of Pandas to be especially beneficial.,5
95327,"Great course, it would be nice to have more interaction and feedback from TA's.",4
95328,"This is a great course with excellent materials and very practical assignments. The course forum is more than supportive, I won't be able to complete this without helps from my peers and all the teaching staff.",5
95329,It's really nice to learn pandas in this courses. Every assignment is full of challenge for me.,4
95330,"The course is quite demanding from the get go. If you are trying to get by with casual interest, then this is not the course for you. Much of my December vacation (which I had earmarked for playing video games) was spent coding on this course.The biggest gripe I have about the course is the grader system. It gives a binary output indicating whether you got the question right or wrong. Unfortunately, often that is not good enough, to debug your code. I spent hours figuring out what's going on. The forums were also not helpful, since there were not many taking the course.At the end of all this, if I ask myself, did I learn a lot? The answer is probably no. However, I did get a lot of coding experience. Debugging experience.We have many databases (MySQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, etc), which have far more powerful features than what pandas can do. Therefore, as a system designer, it is unclear to me as to why I would ever pick Pandas over the rest. It appears quite slow (compared to the likes of time tested databases). It offers very few features (when compared to a DB). Lastly, I can use it only with Python. To me, it appears to be a no-brainer to use any one of those DBs to store, modify and massage my data. Maybe there are valid applications that can make use of Pandas like features, but I did not learn that from the courseSummary:Better Motivation to use Pandas over standard DatabasesBetter grader design.",3
95331,"To be an introductory course I struggled a lot, is a very practical course, and the assignements encourage you to learn more. This is the best technical course I have taken. Lo recomiendo ampliamente",5
95332,"Excellent course for data analysis in python, although the assignments are quite challenging and time consuming for beginners. During the course, I wish I could access to the correct codes after passing minimum score so that I could compare what I did with what common practices would be. We all code in different ways to achieve the same outcome, but it would be nice to know the most efficient ways/styles.",5
95333,Very condensed and practical. Good fit for the ones who already have some experience in DS using other tools (like R).,5
95334,"In my humble opinion, this course does not have a correct balance of difficulty of new concepts/tools with the exercises given by the course to practice. It is a ""hey, look, there is something called pandas out there that may be very useful for you"" but it is too introductory. And I know the course has the word ""Introduction"" in the title but that does not grant, in my opinion, to run a 4-week course such as this one with so little content",3
95335,"As compared to some other machine learning/data science courses offered ""Introduction to Data Science in Python"" was very pragmatic. Starting out with simple data cleaning and data structuring may not be the most exciting thing ever, but it was extremely useful to learn the basic tools needed to be a competent data scientist. One point of warning - the homework and projects took me about twice a long as suggested by the course notes.",4
95336,Very interesting and fun,5
95337,"Positive aspects:Readings were relevant and interesting.I learned a lot.I was challenged.Negative aspects:Programming assignments took SIGNIFICANTLY longer than suggested (I have 20+ years of programming experience and am fluent in 3 programming languages, but I'm new to Python).Course did not provide enough support to learners. You're on your own to learn the material and you won't get timely responses (if any) from the staff. I asked clarifying questions about lecture material on the Discussion Forums and got no response (twice).Several concepts were not taught with appropriate detail / explanation. For example, there was no instruction on how to read error messages in Python.",2
95338,Nice lecture. Needs to have more videos and more advanced tutorials,4
95339,"Course material is interesting and modern, but its amount might be bigger - current level is not enough to complete all the assignments.",5
95340,i loved the course!. This was my first experience on Data Science and I really liked the approach to the subject.,5
95341,course was good but teaching material was not enough to complete the assignment,4
95342,Awesome Course......,5
95343,"Quite a fast-paced course, with very quick and packed lectures. Would have preferred the course to be slightly longer e.g. 6 weeks and covering more content. I actually found the style of the coursework to be a plus - though it involved a lot of Googling, this is more reflective of real life, where answers aren't just handed to you on a plate. However, the instructions for the assignments aren't very clear in places, which can easily cause you to become stuck.",4
95344,To much disconnect between assignments and lectures,3
95345,"It is a tough class for me, I read over three times, I feel good to pass the assignment.",5
95346,Thank you very much for this course. I really enjoyed the level of the course. In particular the fact that a decent amount of research was needed to work on the assignment.A few issues with the programming assignment. Especially at the beginning. I am assuming this is because this is the first version that uses jupyter notebooks.,5
95347,Very comprehensive in terms of the amount of material covered and the content covered in the material. Covers a lot of model building algorithms in addition to machine learning fundamentals. Has an intuition lecture in addition to the fundamentals which helps a lot! A possible change could be to use R to demonstrate the concepts instead of Matlab/Octave.,5
95348,"instructor is too fast, video lectures are not enough and assignment questions are not clear which wastes much time just to understand the question",1
95349,Excellent Course. It covers many useful topics and tips for Pandas.,5
95350,"The project that is the end assignment is a very interesting exercise with real life application of information that is readly available to the public for real-world decisions.Aside from that, it is a great course that scratchs the surface of what Pandas can do and open wide open all the possibilities it can give you :D",5
95351,Challenging and well worth the effort.,5
95352,"A great practical course.This course will make you think and search a lot on stackoverflow,which is good because a lot can be learned by doing it ourselves.Then why this course because we need to know what to look for and this course gives us the basics and we will be able to do the assignments by ourselves .Its not really tough but will need some time to get all the answers correct.",5
95353,"Very challenging course yet very informative. I am looking forward to the rest of the courses in this series.A word of warning: if you are not familiar with statistics, parts will be very difficult. If you are not familiar with Python the whole course may be very very difficult.",4
95354,Great Course!,5
95355,"So useful, learn the course through programming assignment, you need to do a lot of self-study and google, not just restrict within the course material, this is the way I love to study",5
95356,Very helpful and demanding,5
95357,Course should be more interactive and details,4
95358,"This is exactly the course you need to get started and familiar with Pandas. The home work requires a lot of self-study, which i enjoyed a lot. Only thing is that you have to wait until the end of the course to see best practice code for all home works.",5
95359,"Great course, Gives good outline to navigate through the essential content",4
95360,Great Course!!!,5
95361,"Course is good. I'd like to see more code assignments, because the pandas basics should be studied in more details, IMHO.",5
95362,good course. kickstarted me with python and datascience,5
95363,"Great course to learn python if you have prior coding experience with languages like java, C++ or javascript.",5
95364,"The professor speaks really fast, but the content is fantastic. This course is extremely practical.",5
95365,I really enjoyed this course. I found the instructor very good and the assignments were fun. I was pleasantly surprised by the whole course.,5
95366,assignment is a little bit messy.,3
95367,It was a challenge course!!!,5
95368,"这是一门很棒的课程. 尤其是他的作业. 尽管有时候作业的说明不是很清楚.This is an excellent course , although its programming assignment needs to have somehow clearer explanation . But anyway I like this course .",5
95369,"After having taken several Data Science-related courses, this course seems like a good introduction to Python for Data Science applications. Not much 'actual Data Science' is covered in the course, however. It's more practically-oriented in the sense that it deals with data preparation (loading, cleaning and merging data). You don't get the luxury of the common perfectly-prepared csv-files in this course, which is a good thing!",4
95370,Very good course.,5
95371,"I think the structure of the lessons are highly relevant for data sciecne and taught well. So for Syllabus content I think you are doing veryy wellCons: Nearly all the problems I encountered were related to the autograder not being helpful! There could be better error handling/debugging i.e. instead of just saying the answer is wrong, explain why and the aswer that is expected. For example, I spent DAYS on the final question (run ttest)of the last assignment. I had the right answer all along except the autograder was expecting the type to be numpy float 64, whereas my answer was just a float!",4
95372,This was a good course and quite challenging. It requires a lot of self learning if you are not familiar with pandas. I wish some of the technics that were required to solve the assignments were better explained in the course material.,4
95373,"Excellent course and the content is presented very efficiently. I often watch lecture for other courses at a 1.25x or 1.5x speed, but this was different. I could barely keep up at the regular speed. Highly recommended.",5
95374,I recomendIntroduction to Data Science in Pythonit is a good piece of knowledge,4
95375,"This is great course! I liked balance between theory and practice. And also tasks are covering something that is out of the week material, but can be easily found in the web (with provided suggestions)",5
95376,"It is an interesting course. I would say this course expects more from students than other courses. It does not take you by the hand in working with Pandas. For the assignments you will spend a lot of time in the Pandas documentation and Stack Overflow. I don't know about others, but this lead to my code being very clunky and not Pandorable code.",4
95377,Really nice course to get you start with the Data science in Python,5
95378,Perfect course,5
95379,It provides a very good introduction to both Data Science and Python.,5
95380,"Great course! Dr. Brooks provides a nice and accessible introduction to Pandas, and the assignments are helpful and problem-based. Highly recommend!",5
95381,unclear and poorly thought out,1
95382,Worth it!,5
95383,"Pretty good course. I have definitely learned a lot and would like to thank you the lecturer and all the people who were working to create this course. The only comment I have is following. Please, try to formulate the questions more clear in the homework assignments. The assignment # 4 is especially bad in this sense. You can look at the comments of people in the forum to understand that it is not just my own problem.",4
95384,One of the best courses in Coursera!!,5
95385,Assignments needs slight polishing. Otherwise course delivers what it promises.,4
95386,Spent more time figuring out what was being asked in the assignment rather than solving the assignment. Typos in assignment questions led to wasted hours without understanding why the grader kept rejecting solutions. Course content was useful and I would recommend if you are willing to live through the pain of the assignment submission.,4
95387,"Good for Beginners. Assignments are good but question framing was poor. Of course, required doubts are clarified through Discussions. Overall Great Experience doing this course. Thank you!",4
95388,Very nice course. The only problem that I found was the lack of exercises between assignments.,4
95389,Challenging course but worth the effort!,5
95390,Very good intro into how to use Pandas for working with data sets and get insights from your data by using various aggregating functions and statistical tests.,4
95391,Took me ages to complete the assignments given my limited programming skills! But totally enjoyed solving the problems.,5
95392,"This course systematically introduced the use of Python and Pandas library to read data, clean data, transform data, and do statistical analysis.",5
95393,"Superb course and the staff from University of Michigan were quite committed with the learners, they've given me very valuables tools and skills, thanks a lot.",5
95394,Top free course about Data Science. But I think lectures must be more detailed and related to assignments. And assignments could be less ambiguous and more clear.,3
95395,"This is a really great course. Christopher Brooks teaches in a very clear and objective way, in addition to the weekly assignments that are challenging and puts into practice all the content you've learned trough the videos and the material. I really recommend this course!",5
95396,"Although I had some background with Python and Pandas, this course brought new insights in both. With practical examples, it reinforces the conceptual understanding about working with data. I highly recommend this course even if you are already familiar with Pandas",4
95397,"This is a fantastic introductory data science course on Python! I was wondered by the course structure, in-browser code editing and submitting. The first course which granted me an understanding of data cleansing, pandas and python for data science.",5
95398,"This is a *very* good Python Pandas course that's part of a data science specialization that I wish existed 3-4 years ago when I first started using Pandas. As much as I like Wes McKinney's book ""Python for Data Analysis"", having an e-learning format mixing video lectures and hands-on assignments is a definite plus.I've decided to take this class out of curiosity (and in order to get ideas about a class I'm about to teach), and even if I consider myself as an experienced pandas user (top5% on stackoverflow for [pandas]). I think it's pretty involved if you're new to pandas and covers pretty much every key concept of pandas you should (must?) be aware of. The assignments can certainly look very challenging to the newcomer, and they do a great job of looking like an actual project: messy data, multiple sources, etc.I dearly recommend - and I have already started to personally recommend it - this course for anyone who's interested in learning more about data wrangling in pandas!Thanks for putting this together!",5
95399,"The lectures and explanations need more clarity and better instruction quality. The assignment questions were often nebulous. This resulted in lots of time wasted with the grader. The discussion forums were the best part of this class. I'd encourage the course instructors to take a look at the University of Washington's Machine Learning class. Stylistically, pedagogically and content-wise - that's a much, much better Data Science class.",2
95400,Terrible course. Assignments are extremely buggy and often touches on things not even explained in the lectures. Mentors are not active. Explanations are sketchy and not well paced. Do this course only for the examples in the Jupyter notebook.,1
95401,Best Python Pandas 101 course ever. Very recommend,5
95402,"I really like this course, it is a good kick off to learn and practice Pandas. The assignments are more difficult than the avg assignment in coursera courses which I think made this course more productive.",5
95403,It is a great course. especially on the excellent assignments.,5
95404,"This course was much harder than anticipated given it was also my first introduction to Python. Knowing Python coming into this course will make it a lot more manageable. Overall it's an excellent course which touches upon a LOT of items. Given more time on each item, this course could span 10 weeks easily. I now have an understanding of Python basics along with Pandas and a dash of numpy.",4
95405,"Lessons were ok but the assignments were really frustrating, not because of the questions itself but because the questions were organised badly or were really vague and confusing.",1
95406,"I love this kind of courses wehn the lectures are clear, short and meaningfull with real topics and hands on the topic, really good course",5
95407,This course helps me a lot! Thanks for all staffs. Hope the grader system coud give more specific feedback.,5
95408,"Assignments are challenging, but some questions are very vague and require lots of trial and error guesswork to get the autograder to accept them.",3
95409,"The course gives practice in Python, but programming assignments were loaded with ""busy work"" that added little value and often had only loose ties to the material discussed in class. While this forces more independent learning, it also makes it so that this course isn't really much better than free online tutorials. I found myself learning almost everything for the programming assignments from the pandas package documentation and from Google searches that led to stackoverflow. For an instructor from the University of Michigan whose bio says ""I work with colleagues to design tools to better the teaching and learning experience in higher education,"" I was expecting a lot more value for the time spent in this class. I suspect that this course is being used to provide data for furthering his own research. It's often more difficult to maximize value to customers when personal incentives may not be perfectly aligned with customer (student) objectives.",2
95410,"I was quite disappointed by the almost total inaccessibility of the staff in the discussion forums, the unconquerability of the autograder for most of the assignments (losing points for no discernible reason, with all resources exhausted), the lack of a stats module for the specialization, and the lack of education, really. There is value in asking students to learn on their own, but this course goes much too far with that, giving problem sets that are virtually unsolvable without prior experience in data wrangling in R or some other data language. This leaves serious, hardworking students with little choice but to troll the forums for solutions. Hardly the best way to learn the intricacies of this subject.",1
95411,"great hands on course, with challenging exercises and fast paced lectures.the homework assignments need some rephrasing, as it is not always clear whats being asked.looking forward to the second course in this specialization",5
95412,Overall I thought the level of the course was good. The programming assignments were complex and long enough that you had a good opportunity to re-inforce topics covered in the course. I already had a good bit of pandas experience so the course was helpful to re-inforce things I was already familiar with but hadn't been forced to try out. I think if you don't already have pandas experience the assignments might be tough.,5
95413,High quality content and challenging assignments. Really good!,5
95414,"This course is accurately advertised as requiring intermediate programming experience. It focusses on some of the basic python tools that are used in data science like pandas, specifically dataframes. For a python newbie like me, some of the assignments were quite challenging as they required significant additional reading and search. I would have appreciated if all of the concepts required to solve the assignments were introduced in the same week, so my additional reading and search would have been more targeted. Very little stats if any is required or taught.",4
95415,"I thought the videos for this course were appropriately concise and well-done. The projects were about the right difficulty and length (although the one for week three was more time consuming than expected). They were interesting enough to keep engaged. I think the span of topics was also useful and appropriate. I would have liked if the autograder gave more detailed output on what was wrong with a submission. I also think it would be extremely beneficial to see the ""right"" ways of solving this problems after a submission is completed. I'm sure I didn't use the optimal pandas approach in some instances, as it stands I seem to have no way of knowing and improving my knowledge beyond getting a passing grade.",4
95416,"Not so easy ,not too hard!",4
95417,Good content - some prior knowledge of pandas is important.,4
95418,"Good course, going a bit fast on certain aspects but good use of Jupyter and interesting coursework, challenging enough.",4
95419,Good lectures and a good introduction to the subject matter. Definitely requires additional research and practice is weak on Python and the Pandas library. The comments in the auto grading could be more helpful.,4
95420,"Good introductory course, but I must admit that the assignments are not explained well enough.",4
95421,"Very nice introduction, I wish homework were more clear and the autograder was much more smarter.",5
95422,the best ever,5
95423,it has a very good method of teaching and it is very informative :)),5
95424,"This is a popular course series that many have expressed interest in taking. Rigorous and challenging course that offers excellent, high quality teaching of python pandas. The University of Michigan does not disappoint and neither does the delightful instructor Christopher Brooks. I highly recommend this course to anyone serious about python and data manipulation. Time and money worth spent. Interesting assignments and datasets are found each week. You will learn a great deal. Concise videos with sharp insights from an expert on pandas are seen throughout. Once you finish the first course of the series, it leaves you excited for the second course in the series. Rock on ""pandorable"" pandistas!",5
95425,Wonderful Instructor. Course assignment is strong enough to learn this things. Thanks for this great course.,5
95426,"Completed the course and found it pretty good for the first run. Mostly focused on the Pandas library - you'll be ok if you know a bit of Python, or have experience in another language.Looking forward to subsequent courses.",4
95427,"assignment is really hard, takes me 30 hours at least",4
95428,"Super challenging, but good fun!",5
95429,This is a very useful course. I recommended this course at people that already know how to programming. Week's homework are more difficult than in the description and needs more time( for my personal experience ),5
95430,Good COurse,5
95431,One of the best place to start in Data Science,5
95432,"This course is a decent introduction to using the python pandas data science package, but suffers from some problems.The lectures are very brief and do not prepare you well for the assignments. The assignments are not well described and the autograder is very finicky. As a result, every week I spent several hours on the fora and stackoverflow to figure out what the autograder wants, instead of actually learning pandas. I managed to pass this course with (what I know is) subpar code, but we never get to see proper solutions to the assignments.The course has potential, but as it is now, I will continue this specialisation.",3
95433,"The instructor is warm and seems pretty interested.Content is way too minimal though and it's not enough to prepare the student for the assessments.A lot of searching is required in order to arrive at the solution which more often than not is not the most optimum one. Forums are only supported by fellow students and staff's involvement is next to zero in there. Even threads that deal with clarifying questions were not answered by the staff.I understand that this way enforces community building and helping fellow students, but staff's participation would be highly appreciated.",3
95434,"Well, first thing I am going to say this is not going to be looking good, however correct me if I got anything wrong or being unfair.To be honest, I am very frustrated with this course! It is a very good topic that I am very interested and that's the reason I am enrolled , but the support and the structure of it is very disappointing!Example like this(https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-analysis/discussions/weeks/3/threads/0kwIpLJDEeawPhIF4bjuNg), question is not even specified and waste me so much time looking for the requirement and post discussion board and wait hopefully somebody is going to reply!Same for the ScimEn file , which again the file name was not specified in the question!From last secession, assignment two have lots of confusing around what exactly the question is asking about and again lots of time being wasted just to figure out the question!The support is poor as well, not like other course , I would usually get a answer within the same day , but this one is really when you are lucky! Plus the staff rarely response!In short, I hope the staff of the course would see this. This is a good topic but the course are poorly designed with very limited support!I mean if you are truly love the topic , you should pass on the passion to your students and design the course that students not only learn the material in the course but also can know how to ask questions and find out the questions themselves ,but first like learning any skills students needs to ask lots of questions ! I am not going to mention that ,coz even the question in the course is full of error !!Unless, the whole purpose is to make some money , then it make sense , however if it is that case , I am not going to enrol in this course any more.",1
95435,"It's a good course over all. There is only one thing that I would like to suggest, which is that the autrograder does not seem to work well. It really wasted me lots of time to get the RIGHT ANSWER understood by the autograder.",4
95436,great intro course,5
95437,Very good... but question should have been properly explained (in a detail manner).. overall it was a great learning experience,4
95438,great course,5
95439,"Lectures clear and well-organized. Homework needlessly complicated and with large gap from lecture material. Grader did not give enough info when rejecting submitted work. Weighting last problem at 50% of final week was unpleasant. Hosted platform allowed importing re and io.StringIO, but grader rejected them. Hosted platform had consistent kernel failure on my last solution, but it worked on another system and grader accepted it.",4
95440,"The programming assignments are challenging ( atleast for beginners),with each question taking about 3 hours to complete .Many topics in Pandas are covered , making us reading the docs and finding solutions,that further helps in learning . Excellent course , good support from other learners taking the course and very very informative . No other platform can give us a course ( and knowledge ) of this standard . Planning to take more courses from courseera . However a small feedback : The description for some questions are slightly confusing . Please make such questions more descriptive with examples .",5
95441,"Good material, let down by instructors.",2
95442,quite interesting and challenging,5
95443,Good one! Enjoyed,5
95444,"Contents are very good and assignments are challenging. Perhaps I struggled most trying to understand what the questions actually ask, they should be rephrased or be more clear. But it was a nice course and I would to it again. I am waiting for the next courses to begin.",4
95445,Thanks!,5
95446,The course was really great. Thank you!Sometimes precisely what the questions were asking weren't clear (This may have been resolved by a notebook upgrade but I did not realise this until it was too late) and I did have some issues with the autograder. Otherwise would be five stars.,4
95447,"Really handy and useful materials. However, if we can share our codes online after receiving the certificate will be really helpful. Cause although I finished the course, I still find some of my code is repetitive and not pandorable, and I would like to learn from other talents. Thanks Coursera and University of Michigan.",5
95448,"Autograder is hard to understand and has no feedback. Could improve the feedback mechanism, maybe with peer review. Thanks for the course!",4
95449,I learned A LOT during this course. I was even able to apply some of this knowledge at work after week 2 (and I do not have a technical job - I do this on my own time).It did feel a little complicated at some times. Some more detailed explanations in the assignments could help. We don't always know what the autograder expects...,5
95450,"A course which has great assignments. However, the video itself is a bit boring. Most of the time, my motivation to learn this course is just doing its assignments.At the same time, the assignments are somewhat difficult for those who are not familiar with Python, but for me it's just OK. What I want to make complaints about the assignments is that sometimes the Autograder is so rigid that I have to try one question over and over again until the Autograder ""feels happy"", and for me, sometimes the gap between ""correct answer"" and ""incorrect answer"" isn't so large...And finally, thank you, teacher Christopher Brooks! You are ateacher full of passion, and I actually learnt a lot from you and your course.",3
95451,"Lectures were interesting and well put together, however the assignments and the knowledge required for the assignments were not covered in the lecture material. While I can appreciate that every course will require some elements of self-learning and exploration, this felt a step too far. My sense is that if you have some experience in the actual topics covered by the course, and are looking to verify your knowledge with a certificate, you will be fine. However if you are hoping to actually learn about the topics, you are going to have to work very hard. I'm hoping that the coverage of course material to assignment requirements is a lot better in the subsequent courses in this specialization.",3
95452,This course covers basics of pandas dataframes. So useful for amateur/advanced programmers who want to start learning data science. The assignments are very good and help students learn how to pre-process and use data retrieved from web.,5
95453,"The class was a helpful intro to pandas. But it was not as much a class as it was a series of homework assignments and the student painstakingly looking things up on stackoverflow. In the end, i am positive I got the correct answers using a horrible coding method and will never see the correct solutions. There should be a little bit more handholding in order for the student to learn the concepts. Otherwise, I might just throw a class up on coursera, give the link to docs.python.org, tell the students to read it and then they will be experts at python.",2
95454,"A hands on course on the basic tools needed to process data from experiments, web data, etc. The final assignment demands everything learned througout the course and it's a perfect example for what one would face on a daily basis.",5
95455,starting to like this,1
95456,"Very hard course comparatively speaking, especially when one needs to manage so many other things. But I think it was worth the figurative blood and tears. Thank you!",5
95457,Great course,5
95458,"Excellent class, learned quickly and simply !",5
95459,Really great course about data science in python and pandas in particular. Absolutely recommended!,5
95460,Learn a lot with Pandas.,4
95461,"I have two general comments:The first comment is . . . there was too wide a gap between the lecture content and the assignments. The second comment I have is . . . I spent too much time trying to figure out what the autograder wanted and not enough time learning Data Science with Python. I can only imagine the work that it takes to develop and launch a course like this. In all, I'm very excited to be part of this program. My comments are critical but hopefully helpful and all your work is appreciated.",3
95462,"This course wasn't quite the cakewalk I was expecting it to be, which is perfectly fine! I definitely would recommend this course for anyone looking to pursue data science/machine learning professionally. I learned a lot of skills that employers look for, and have applied the things I've learned here in other course work as well. 5/5 would recommend.",5
95463,"Great course, assignments take more time than listed, and I found the discussion forum very helpful to learn more about the assignments and interact with other classmates. Overall I learned so much of commands from this course.",4
95464,The assignments do not have clear definition and guildlines. It is very hard to see what's getting wrong in the submission.,4
95465,"Course teaches Python Pandas in a very practical way and I'm sure now having learnt it I'll use the skill. But this course wasn't taught well. Weekly assignments asked questions about skills that had not been taught yet. The course coordinators didn't respond or help in the forums, The topic area deserves more in depth video lectures and discussion. All the above basically means that passing the weekly assignments takes longer than you may assume. Had the course been taught and tested more effectively then doing the weekly assignments would less frustrating and time consuming.Basically the course is good, but it requires much more work and research because of the poor way its caught and monitored by staff.",2
95466,Great course! I liked how the focus was mainly on the practical aspects of data science. No 'dry' course material. I know much more about the practical side of data analysis than before! Thank you!,5
95467,"The lectures are insufficient, the homework instructions are incorrect, the autograder is terrible.",1
95468,"The course is interesting, but the grading system needs to improve substantially. The grader bugs considerably, and the questions are often not well defined, which requires a lot of unnecessary trial and error to understand what exactly the question was about. Finally, complete the assignments took way long that what it is suggested.",3
95469,"This is in fact the worst course so far. Mainly because of auto grader. Here are my reasons.Actually I did not complete the course at all. But I suddenly got a message saying that I have completed the course. I was working on the first problem of the 4th assignment. I did a provisional submission to see if my answer was right. Auto grader reported the grade for the 3rd assignment and said that I have passed the course. Any submission I did after that was not graded at all.The assignments are not very clear. Looks like I had a older version of the questions while others had a different version. I was stuck in a particular problem because auto grader did not give me a clear feedback as to why I was incorrect. I wasted too much time on this already.The assignments require too much research outside what is covered in the videos. I don't feel that is right. The assignment requires that we research on Stack Overflow and Pandas documentation. I strongly feel that such activities should be performed only outside the course work when we try to solve real world problems. Course assignments should be reasonably given based only the materials covered in video. This was taking too much time.TThe discussion forums are not giving clear hints. When we are stuck in a problem, we are not able to proceed further. I still son't know the answers for certain problems because the coordinators do not explain the answers well. When we complete assignments we don't get to see the instructor's solution.The video instructions were too fast paced. The instructors do not pause and explain critical aspects of the code.Overall I am very disappointed with this course. There are much better videos on Youtube and Lynda than this . I am sorry. I never thought it would be this bad. The first course on Python from University of Michigan was really very good.",1
95470,The assignments were good but it was a lot of time spent with the grader.,3
95471,Nice course to learn data science.,5
95472,it's a really good course .it's not like a traditional course in university in China.You should put all your efford to finish it.And it full of challenge,5
95473,"The course was great - the lectures were clear and simple; I learned a great deal! However, instructions for the assessments could have been clearer, and there were a few issues with the autograder (though I'm sure those will be weeded out).",4
95474,"Even short, but give a hint and big picture how data science works",5
95475,"This course was excellent...I first found the course odd since the instructor went through the material quite quickly in the lectures. It took me a while to figure out that the material was available as a course download. Once I found that it was easy to follow along with the instructor...need two monitors ideally for this to work. If you cannot step through the Jupyter notebook as the instructor goes through the material, you will be lost...and you will not get the most out of the class.",5
95476,"The course is good and provide great challenges to do a lot of things with Python and Pandas. However, I find that its resource material sometimes lacking complex examples. This may be intentional in order for the students to learn from external resources as well. However, this can also causes difficulties for people who are not already familiar with Pandas before they start following the course.",4
95477,"Great! Even for someone with some python / pandas experience, it was a nice refresher / found new tips / tricks. I actually enjoyed the fact that the assignments didn't hold your hand and forced students to solve problems with the forum and other resources. Look forward to the rest of the courses in this specialisation!Two aspects you could improve is teaching is (1) Multiindex and (2) Regex. It seemed like you purposely avoided discussing these. These should be a mandatory subjects to learn.",4
95478,"The theory and examples are very good and cover a lot of functionalities. I like most the questions that pop up in the middle of the videos, it is a great way to check whether you understood the concepts.Some parts require refinements, the questions in the middle of the videos must be synchronized with the content (there is a little time gap) and the questions in the weekly assignments must be reviewed in depth, I dislike wasting a lot of time trying to understanding what is required to answer in each question.",4
95479,This course is a challenging (and solid) introduction to using python.,4
95480,"This was way above my level knowledge. One will definitely a strong level of knowledge in stats and data analysis to begin with. The Python part is but only a tool in this module / course.For that reason I found the tutorials way too fast paced. I had to go back on everything and test, so a 5 mins tutorial video would sometimes take me 30 mins or longer to complete.The 3 hour / 4 hour assessments took me days!Yet - a great way to jump into something new! The course itself is great. The presentation and content is just as great.",4
95481,I like the course very much. It was fun to learn and to do the exercises. There were some rough edges in the assignments but I'm sure these will be straightened out in time.,4
95482,"The content and assignments are certainly useful and relevant. However, the lectures are too short and do not help much with doing the assignment. As a beginner, I relied heavily on google and the discussion forum to get through the assignment. And I am not sure if i can actually tackle similar problems again without referring back to the pre-mentioned resources.",3
95483,Excellent! A little harder for new students in python but very interesting!,5
95484,"More concise coding tutorials and less ""search on your own on the internet"" needed. It is great to get to know the online community and the course needs more coding example directly relat to exams.",3
95485,"Wow, this course was intense but worth it!",5
95486,A great introductory class to data science with challenging assignments to build a solid understanding of pandas and numpy .,5
95487,"It is useful, but there are some notable flaws. My biggest problems were with the clarity of the assignment questions (some were unacceptably vague) and the feedback that the autograder gives. Fortunately, fellow classmates on the forums are extremely helpful in figuring this all out.",4
95488,"Excellent class. Needs a little work to make sure assignments a little more clear, but with a bit of work from the student, it's a great learning experience.",5
95489,"The jupyter notebook made this a horrid experience. Plus Coursera really doesn't want you to bother them with your silly questions, relying on peer-forums. If you scroll through the week's discussion forums, many student posts go ignored.You can't drop the course past the second (I guess) week so the system will keep on keeping on long after you've given up on trying to figure out the janky notebook thing.Will not return to Coursera for any reason. Breathtakingly bad experience.",1
95490,"Very knowledgeable professors, but very little explanation or actual 'teaching'. Graded assignments require a lot of self-education.",1
95491,"I like the content covered in the lectures. That's very useful for me to clean data parsed from webpages. There is one thing I hope the course can improved, which probably has been mentioned in the forum for many times: the auto-grader is not flexible that it doesn't grant any points to answers that is slightly different from the submitted form (e.g. upper/lower cases, white space, etc.) and we have a hard time figuring out what exactly the auto-grader is accepting. I would suggest modifying the auto-grader such that it allows flexibility in answer acceptance, or breaking down questions into smaller parts (more partial credits) and give more precise/detailed description on the format of answer expected.",4
95492,"Really good course BUT be prepared for a very fast pace of the lectures. I'd placed in the ""advance beginner"" or ""intermediate low"" level, therefore, you need to have previous knowledge of Python. As in College, lectures and assignments are somewhat related, but you will spend some additional time investigating by yourself to get the appropriate responses. Again, just like College where Lectures are level 2-3 but assignments are level 7-8 (out of 10).",5
95493,I thank so much professor Brooks and the team of the cours.,5
95494,"Awsome course with good balance betweern Challange,Reasearch and Progression.",5
95495,"Although the tests can be a bit fiddly, this is a great course if you already have a bit of background with Python and/or data cleaning. Lecture and tutorial videos are lean and information-dense.",4
95496,"This course was excellent. This course deviates from many garbage MOOC who only work with quiz and can not provide a real python coding challenge experience. Assignements are really tough. But my sense of progress is real.(I have struggled to identify such feel in many pytyhon MOOC). Jupyter base for everythjng is a fantatsic format(it even allows coding mobility betwwen my station at work and my home station through the coding on jupyter in the cloud) . My feedback nevertheless will point to some aspect in my experience and where I think you can improve.Succeeding the assignement does not mean that we identified the most elegant way to apply all the knowledge of the course(lambdas,list comprehension, grouping..., apply) in our coding. Breaking that barrier is not easy for me unless we are forced at it and so my looping mind is often applied in assignments. A real correction with the answer need to be provided(this is what the real classroom would do, we managed to get to the answer but we could still learn more with an assisted correction just like what the real classroom would do.I understand that you are worry that the model will end up as copy paste on a webpage and will kill your value. You could maybe consider this add_on for paid customers only and only provide it in picture way which can only be paper print and not so easily converted to webpage format.Or you need to find an alegant way to randomize the assignment coding test at each coursera session, which in that case would not bring any forgery issue and you could provide the correction at the end of the course(or after each assigment completed).Videos are a bit too fast on concepts sometimes.You could split the assigment in two formats: format where simple principle of the course are first resolved on jupyter notebook (just like the videos case but with more exercices) and complex dataframe case as second assignment .(but please reduce the amounts of case to only 1 or 2, not 3)You could reduce dataframe case.(I've spend easily 40 hours on assigment here, assigment time is too heavy from my workload as a full time scientist. This needs some carefull tuning.Overall Great Job",5
95497,"Really awesome course. It is a kind of do it yourself course.The assignments are tough to crack. I think a little bit of programming experience is neccessary. The lectures themselves only give the basic knowledge. The assignments make you do research on the relevant topics. The autograder is pretty bad, it gives false negatives a lot of times, but that i believe is Coursera's drawback and they are working on it.",5
95498,"Very challenging course. And I thought I knew Python.I learned much, much more about Pandas, idioms, lambdas, regex, etc. I will be able to be more productive at work with all this. Thanks.",5
95499,"Excellent course, I learned a lot especially through the assignments. Missing a fifth star because of a lot of issues with the notebooks autograding, and sometimes imprecise instructions in the assignments. Still I look forward to working on the next pandas courses!",4
95500,Contents are great and very relative. Exam is fair and reasonable. However students have to deal with an autograder for the scores and the autograder is not up to par for this course. The amount of time that you spend on learning during the course is only a fraction of time you spend to get through the autograder.,3
95501,"The course was challenging, and although I would have liked a bit more information from the video lectures, and a bit more practice on using the basic functions, I learned a lot.I thought the video lectures were a little sparse. There were only 20-30 minutes worth of video lectures per week and the assignments required you to stretch the knowledge that you gained from the lecture videos quite a bit.More examples in video lectures would have helped. I would have also liked to see a few simple problems in each assignments just to get comfortable using the various functions introduced in the lecture.So overall, the course was challenging and definitely a fair amount of work coming from someone new to python (but moderately experienced in C programming), and although I would have liked a bit more guidance, I learned a lot.",3
95502,Pace of lectures is rather fast and doesn't fit to homework level (which is much harder). But overall course is OK,4
95503,"A good introduction to python and data science. The questions were just about the right level of difficulty. My main criticism is that the online videos were pretty short and not going into a lot of detail, whereas with the questions you had to do a lot of extra research to figure out how to solve them. More interaction with the enrolled students during the course and having more in-depth videos would make the course a lot better.",3
95504,No or least support.Course Quality is great but problems with grader will left you with wasting your expensive time.Assignments are good but intend to go wayyy more beyond the scope and to learn from online materials though other sites.Grading system is not easy. You have the right answer but you'll need to waist hours to produce specific string for your grader to be satisfied.This i not an elegant learning process at all.,2
95505,"Total disaster. I payed 315euro for this course. Course started on 24/10/2016. I faced with technical difficulties till this weekend. I reported this problem already many times.. Finally this weekend the Jupiter notebook worked and I started the first assignment. I spent many hours but still couldn't get solve the assignment. I read discussions, write post.. Searched on Google.. Read lots of document. I still couldn't get what the correct answer is the assignment wants. I realized that it is impossible to pass this exam. In the lectures they don't mention anything which will help you to solve this time consuming assignment by the way.. After having this terrible course experience this weekend, today (14/11/2016) I decided to apply for refund. But guess what I says 14 days have passed so I cannot get refund!!!! Now I payyed 315 euro for nothing but disappointment!!!!",1
95506,good intro to pandas and some numpy. students need to deep dive into each subject to become proficient,5
95507,"Good course materials and the assignment itself is pretty good, but the grader is buggy, not informative and wasted a lot of my time.",2
95508,Take this course if u can invest a lot of time in searching for stuff yourself. Content and videos are okay but the assignments are very tough,4
95509,The course is very interesting. The Jupiter notebook is very useful.I don't like that many examples are very US-specific. Some important terms may not be clear for people who live outside USA.Update: I'm lowering my grade from 4 stars to 3 stars because of very confusing assignments. Often it's not clear the requirement of the task. It takes very long to understand. Also some assignments require methods and functions that were not covered in video lectures.,3
95510,Great course.,4
95511,"besides the major technical issues and lack of information before the postponed start of the course and minor technical issues, the way of teaching is well adapted to on-site classes where you can sit in study groups solving the problems together; the given examples have partly little relevance and do not help to solve the assignments and according to the staff the best way to solve assignments is by using google (or stackoverflow or whatever) - really?! somehow it seems they just took an on-site course, played with some fancy technical solutions and call it now a MOOC... they seem not really aware of the fact that on-site teaching and MOOCs require completely different types of pedagogic methodsamazing how the same university can offer both the best MOOC (Dr. Chuck's) and one of the worst (this one)",1
95512,"Amazing Training on Python Data Science, doing the course assignment its like read the book Python for data analysis. I believe this course is not trivial and is not intermediate level, is an advanced level, Is a real challenge. Definitively i recommend it.",5
95513,"A great intro to pandas. Challenging even for those with experience using the library. There were some struggles with the autogravder, but they were being worked out, and the integration of the Jupyter notebook system directly into the class is fantastic.",4
95514,Great Course!,5
95515,"lots of practice, enjoyable.",5
95516,"Very nice course format. Sometimes really challenging, and outright fun ! I wish there would have been a little more participation by staff / mentors, but this is just a minor cutback. Recommended to everyone !",5
95517,"This course is good but instructor is very bad..... Not providing good course lectures and materials... The lecture is very fast and not covering all the things being asked in the assignment... I am leaving this course due to this.. I have successfully done other python courses, because there, the instructor was very good and his teaching style was awesome...I have wasted lot of my times enrolling in this particular course... Though the course conception is good, instructor and course materials are not up to the mark....",1
95518,Excellent material. Excellent teaching. Challenging problem sets. Autograder needs some work.,5
95519,"To be honest, I think the course is very good, however, it may be need to more clear on the description of the questions in assignment.",4
95520,Great pace for intermediate level people.,4
95521,"Great course, fast and deep, I liked it very much",5
95522,an exceptional course by MU. Very good course and content,5
95523,Very good lectures and examples. Horrible autograder - very stiff and all results must be in a very strict order and format. Extremenly vague questions prone to misinterpretation.Most of the time is not spent on analysing data or coding but trying to understand the autograder and questions. The stress should be somewhere else. As a whole poorly prepared course.,2
95524,Very good design and teaching for a intermediate level learning course! Easy to learn with practice with Jupyter notebook.,5
95525,"Thank you Mike, for providing such a Course! When I looked for Courses on corporate sustainability, I found less than expected. Hence, being happy to have found this. I really enjoyed the Course and I strongly recommend it. And for someone who had already dealt with this Topic before the Course, the Content could have been Little more detailed and comprehensive. But since the Course addresses not only People who deal with the Topic on a regular Basis, obviously it is understandable why it is designed like that.",4
95526,A truly unique course that highlights the importance that businesses of all sizes play in regards to sustainability. It offers strategies based around a logical and empathic approach with all stakeholders in mind.,5
95527,"Just started the course, and from the onset it is very interesting and enriching. Thanks for making it available.",5
95528,"This course would feel very basic to anyone who has studied sustainable development or sustainable business in any form. It may complement what you've already learnt by articulating the concepts well, but the lecture videos felt redundant after reading material for Week 1. This course can be improved by adding a few in-depth case studies to the weekly assignments.",3
95529,"Excellent presentation, solid lesson plan, and one of the most educational approaches to strategy. Professor Rosenberg illustrated comprehensible presentations and lesson that kept me engaged. Highly recommend for those learning about Sustainability.",5
95530,THANK YOU!,4
95531,This was a very useful course that comes with numerous tools to get your home and work schedule organized. The professor is engaging and fun. There are also many videos showing examples of the techniques in practice to help you decide what methods might work best for you. I highly recommend this course to get your schedule more together!,5
95532,"Great course, very objective, full of practical tips! It was a game-changer in my teaching life!!",5
95533,Amazing course!,5
95534,great course,5
95535,This course was enjoyable and the tools and system I learned is really serving me well. I've made a couple tweaks and even shared some of what I have learned with fellow teachers.,5
95536,"very helpful, clear and easy",5
95537,"This course really helped me stay on top of all my tasks. I notice that I've become more organized, and I don't procrastinate as often. A lot of the times, I will simply start on a task without adding it to my worksheet first. It's like my brain's more organized! I highly recommend this course.",5
95538,"Very useful, making my own plan for the classroom and outside. It really worked for me!!",5
95539,I loved all the formats that help us to get organized. I am a new teacher and they were awesome. Thank you very much.,5
95540,Great ideas to planning and keeping everything in one place. It has changed my life.,5
95541,"This course was helpful. I will not be using everything I learned, but I did like the comprehensive calendars so I have continued to use those.",4
95542,Really helpful,5
95543,This has helped me to stream line my planning both at work and at home. Many take away ideas that I still use.,4
95544,It was an excellent course. I learnt good strategies for organizing my time. I recommend it.,5
95545,"A simple easy course, but to the point and effective. I recommend this course.",4
95546,"I was a teacher who couldn't plan nor organize, somtimes I still struggle. Everybody kept telling me I would learn this along the way. For me that wasn't the case. Someone needed to teach me how. This course is beautifully explicit and clear. Thank you so much.",5
95547,Short videos with lots of useful tips.,5
95548,Very detailed and helpful. It helped me decide for my present method.,4
95549,Very useful and close to practice,5
95550,This is a pretty basic course. It teaches you three tools to organize your work and home to-do lists. I do not think I will use the system that was taught.,3
95551,A must-take course for any teacher and any one who wants to improve their productivity or time management. Sign up right now!,5
95552,Learning how to create a scheduling page that suited my life instead of learning how to cope with a generic off-the-shelf planner has made all the difference. My method is still evolving but it's evolving rather than crashing and burning and trying to start all over again. I've been using the tips learned in this course for more than a year and a half.,5
95553,"Helpful, but the teacher is annoying and condesending.",3
95554,This is something I needed for a long time.Thanks for helping me get organized.,5
95555,"This course is life-changing. I'm the most Type A person I know, but my system for keeping my life organized was a bit less realistic and functional than was comfortable. This course has transformed my practice!",5
95556,Very nicely organised course. There are free templates available for keep focused on the important tasks.,5
95557,Great course! Very useful reflections and tools.,5
95558,I really love the way this course is done! The trainer is impressive as well,5
95559,"Simple yet thorough, practical ways to get it together. Can't wait to roll out these strategies as someone who has tried a multitude of organization techniques. Would recommend for everyone, not just teachers!",5
95560,This was very useful. I used what was taught and had my most organized year ever! Thanks,4
95561,great class. Offers specific tools for different personalities and real life advice applicable even when you're not a teacher!,5
95562,Changed my life!,5
95563,This really helped me even though I am not a teacher,4
95564,"A really useful course. It helped me to organize my everyday life, it even have changed my philosophy of life - each minute is important!",5
95565,good course to help me get organized,5
95566,Very useful! I wish I had done this course before the beginning of the academi,5
95567,"The formats of different kinds of weekly plans in this course are really helpful, and I also learned a lot from reviewing others. Though I'm not a teacher, I do recommend this course very much.",5
95568,Excellent materials and loved the flexibility of the suggestions!,5
95569,I took this a year ago and I still use the strategies! I loved it.,4
95570,I've been using it for two years now.such simple system yet powerful tool,5
95571,"This course is brilliant, full of insights and easy to start routines that make your life as a teacher so much easier and most of all brings back the fun part of being a teacher!All the skills I picked up during this course are helping me in my day to day life as a teacher and have helped me cut out some ""me time"" in my fast-peaced life styleThank-you",5
95572,"Calling this a course is a stretch.It would even be a stretch to call it a workshop. Course material is thin and you can go through it in a couple of hours. If you squeeze the content, you can probably get a couple of pages of notes out of it.Having said that, it is somehow useful, if you don't already have a system in place that works for you. I would only recommend this course to someone with a serious personal management issue.",3
95573,stimulated.,5
95574,"This is a wonderful Course, if you are having issues about time management this will surely help. Totally recommended.",5
95575,I am still doing it... but it hal already changed my life. Thank you for this great course!,5
95576,"The course presents some very useful tools to help you to be a together teacher, but also helps you think what kind of person you are, what will work for you and how to adapt those tool in order to make it work in your daily life.",5

95661,"This is without a doubt my favorite class that I have ever taken (especially online)! The videos were well done with the right balance of lecture, visuals, and videos. The quizzes were challenging, yet not impossible. My sincerest gratitude to Professor Starn and his team. I'm hoping Professor Starn creates more courses like this one! Thank you for stimulating my mind and keeping me intrigued!",5
95662,"I like it and this teaches me a lot, really helpful.",5
95663,"Fantastic humanistic approach, very well designed and above all the passion of the professor Starn is fundamental! great job!",5

95674,AMAZING COURSE!!,5
95675,This is by far the best course I have taken from Coursera. Orin is very knowledgeable and passionate in his lectures.,5

95677,very interesting,5
95678,class is wonderful!,5
95679,"bunch of information, but the videos are tedious",2
95680,This course has been very interesting for me. Has given me tools for a better understanding of chamber music and appreciate various stages of the history of composers and the works we have reviewed. I enjoy it a lot and I continue to check several details in the listening list. thank you very much.,5
95681,I really enjoyed. Thank you! Headed to forming my String Quartet!,5
95682,"Excellent, it's just awesome to enjoy all the items of this course: info, performances, analysis, etc.",5
95683,"Outstanding course. The presenters were expert in their fields, the material and presentations were engaging and varied. This was a remarkable journey of listening, learning, exploration and discovery from the very beginnings of the genre right up until now.",5
95684,"Thank you so much. I would heartily recommend the course to anyone with even a remote interest in classical music, whether they play an instrument or listen for pleasure and certainly defy anyone not to come away delighted and enlightened. This has been a very special experience and being able to return to the course videos and musical materials is a real boon.",5
95685,"As a late-starter/returner in a new quartet, I found this course excellent. The discussions and demonstrations brought the material to life. My only problems arose in trying to access the online resources which I could rarely get to work. Also, the ""no-strings"" questions were fun, but I could not submit any answers as the relevant link never appeared on my screen. I use an Apple iMac. I was of course tempted to return on occasion to aim for 5/5 in the quizzes, but did not. I think this aspect might be omitted, though I can see it might help avoid demotivating a disappointed student!",5
95686,"A magnificent course on a critical area of classical music. Because composers wrote in so many genres, it's easy for players to only know the pieces which pertain to them, and miss huge numbers of extremely important works by their most influential composers. This class is a great window into and area any non-string player can miss easily. The music and commentary is incredible and very well presented. A total must-see for serious music students.",5
95687,This was an excellent course. It gave me a deeper understanding of the grace to be found in the string quartet.,5
95688,Good job! Intersting and clear),5
95689,An excellent and very enjoyable course. Well constructed and well taught.,5
95690,This is a very interesting course. Our two professors do an amazing job presenting the course materials.,5
95691,This course is an overview of String Quartet music. It provides some nice resources to get to know certain composers or quartets better. It helped guide me to some nice music. The instructors are knowledgeable and do a good job imparting some of their insight into the lectures. The level of detail is about right for my time and attention span.,4
95692,good and useful course,4
95693,Very interesting and informational. I really enjoy the wide range of composers discussed here.,5
95694,"Especially liked the musical demos of various pieces, interspersing lectures with descriptive passages.",5
95695,"This course proved to be a waste of time. There was nothing about the structure and forms of the strong quartet, just ""here's a good one to listen to."" Almost complete devoid of intellectual content.",1
95696,"I'm not a professional musician, but I really enjoyed learning more about Quartet music from this course. The teachers Albert and Mia reveals course not too fast not too slow, but at great rate that it gets absorbed nicely in the head. Also they definitely know what they are talking about. Also Aizuri Quartet is astounding. Love it",5
95697,I enjoyed the course immensely. Thank you,5
95698,Very good and wide ranging performances. The insights were interesting.,4
95699,Enjoy totally in this course.,5
95700,"Great course, even if you have little background in this area.",5
95701,I thoroughly enjoyed this course and recommend it highly. Pacing through pieces I had earlier glanced over or resisted was especially worthwhile in revealing further treasures and I really appreciate the performers' discussions. That this particular medium evokes such a powerful response is wondrous.,5
95702,Extremely interesting and informative course. Listening to a string quartet discuss and then demonstrate their playing was particularly enjoyable.,5
95703,"Thank you for this wonderful course. It provided an overview of the history of the string quartet. It exposed me to music I was not familiar with and helped me appreciate the genre. Because of this course, I have already bought CDs of the complete string quartets of Tchaickovsky and Schubert and plan to keep expanding my collection. I now take time every evening to listen to one work before I go to bed. It has added a new d",5
95704,Fantastic course. I am amazed how much I have learned about the string quartet.,5
95705,This is a great course. The professors are wonderful and they clearly have a tremendous love (which they pass on to their pupils) of the subject matter. Week six blew my mind.,5
95706,"Fantastic discussion and live examples of pieces. This course gave me a wonderful overview and context for understanding the development of the string quartet. What I found most fascinating was the pure objectivity in the lectures and the plethora of styles I was introduced to that previously I had not known (Webern, Smetana and Shostakovitch). Both Mr. Steinhardt and Ms Chung are excellent scholars. I highly recommend this course as it gives you a lifetime of specific quartets to get to know.",5
95707,A very good introduction to the wonderful world of string's quartet.Thanks a lot.,4
95708,This course was incredibly interesting and greatly informative! I am an amateur violinist and loved the historical information about the composers and the demonstrations by the Aizuri Quartet.,5
95709,An excellent course that opens up a new world.,4
95710,Superb course. I learnt so much!,5
95711,"I enjoyed the structure of the lectures. For me the composers stories, the analysis of the narratives and the musical fragments were extremely interesting. Without an extensive background on music theory however, I had some difficulties following the musical analysis of Mia sometimes. However, I learned a lot, and am really grateful for your effort to put together a course in which you presented so many great composers in an attractive fashion to a large public, without losing the grandeur of the music.",4
95712,very emotional,4
95713,Great music but quizzes seem to come from footnotes to the lessons!,1
95714,"I can't stop watching the lessons. Lovely demonstrations with a real quartet. So organized, the actual teachers respond to our questions.",5
95715,"To dig deeper into music theory, it helps to explore specific genres one-by-one. So to create a sort of spider's web of knowledge in one's mind to which any future knowledge can adhere to. This is my 3rd music course from coursera, and 2nd from Curtis. I very much recommend these. To learn in one's own pace helps to concentrate to subjects at times when the mind is ready and the mood level is good. This makes learning an enjoyable experience. I was no fan of String Quartets before, but I truly am now. The chamber music with it's roots in class system of societies has always troubled me with it's wigs and powders and halls with exclusive acoustics. But after completing this course I can see, that this is all just a facade and the ""chamber"" might as well be my backyard in a sunny afternoon. There are tunes which are very pleasant to hear even when counterpoint is not yet ""your thing"". Thank you for this wonderful experience.",5
95716,This Course is fantastic!!,4
95717,"The course is very good and the instructors are very communicative! The extra material is also very good, you have the chance to listen to so many compositions, which is very important in order to understand the touch of quartets. Personally, I would like to have some more advanced lectures and to be provided with the music sheets of the great composers in order to analyse them and learn from them! If Curtis is planning to organise a more advanced course, I would definitely join!",4
95718,a treasure trove of wonderful masterpieces explored,5
95719,Very informative and interesting in-depth overview of the genre. The additional course resources (videos and recordings) are worth signing up by themselves. Highly recommend for anyone who's just getting into classical music.,5
95720,Great course and fantastic performances!,5
95721,"A very informative, enjoyable course- well presented.",5
95722,Curtis rocks!,5
95723,A great course with wonderful exposure to a range of pieces. And so many demos. I wish there had been time for more.,5
95724,"Truly a rewarding and eye opening course. If one is looking for a low-level work, yet comprehensive exploration of the medium of the String Quartet, this is the course to take. Both instructors are beyond par of excellence as well as entertaining.",5
95725,"This course was an absolute delight! Arnold, Mia, and the lovely and talented musicians made this course something I looked forward to every week and have even created a You Tube play list of the quartets studied in this class which I still listen to on a regular basis. I recommend this course to everyone who loves quartet music whether you are a musician or a dedicated lover of music. I guarantee you will thank me if you take my advice and sign up for The World of the String Quartet.",5
95726,Terrific course!,5
95727,Excellent introduction to this genre. Changed how I listen to music,5
95728,Good course! Learned from others.,4
95729,"Excellent course! I reviewed everything we've learned in the Specialisation so far and more in-depth. I really enjoyed it. And the final quiz let me fix everything I've learned in my mind. I liked it, even though I'm scared of quizzes!",5
95730,Each Module of this course is about the actual work that is done in this field. If you enjoy being challenged this is the course for you.,5
95731,By now ( during the specialization) one of the most challenging courses. But worth the effort.,5
95732,I got so much knowledge through this course!,5
95733,very difficult! requires high levels of intrinsic motivation,4
95734,"Great video, they should be longer and more detailed though.Some of the information about these topics were treated in a more detailed and useful way in the introductory course",3
95735,Very informative Course. Clear value addition.,5
95736,This course provides a clear and straight-to-the-point approach to UX research and prototyping methodologies. The assignments really put knowledge acquired through lessons into practice. And the way in which peer-review exercises are guided makes the learning experience easy and entertaining.,5
95737,I liked a lot when examples are given but I missed going into some deeper thoughts on what are the ways and tools we can and should use.,4
95738,The assignments for this course are more hands on than course 4,4
95739,In general it's really fun here but the assignments takes much more time than told and i wishedthe focus would be more on layouting interfaces.,3
95740,I really love how the students are required to give feedback to each other. I learned just as much from writing out actionable and constructive feedback to colleagues than I did doing the project work.,5
95741,I've enjoyed very much to take this course. The content was pleasant and the professor was very teaching.,5
95742,great course,5
95743,The course content was very crisp and easy to understand. The assignments and suggested reading helped me get a better understanding of the topic.,5
95744,"During Week 1 I was afraid this course was going to be all about conducting interviews (not my favorite), but the rest of the projects were really fun and required creativity. The lectures were short, so it was easy to fit the course load into my schedule. I really enjoyed this class and have already recommended it :)",5
95745,"Excellent practical course. I consider assignments to be more valuable than any lectures, though maybe in this particular course I could welcome a bit more theory and even better — more user case details.",4
95746,Great,5
95747,"Excellence, is a very practical course and and well taught.",5
95748,"I enjoyed the lecture of Ms. Gerber. She has a very clear-cut way of explanation that truly draws me in. However, some of the concept in this lecture is taught without complete examples, so often time I find myself a little puzzled doing the assignment. Also, I would appreciate more chance to do more assignments to fully master the topic, though I understand the limit of a MOOC. Nevertheless, nice course!",4
95749,"Great, interactive assignments that are clear, relevant, and a lot of fun to do.",5
95750,"Being a woman I love seeing Elizabeth Gerber talking about design. She is so passionate about the topic, it translates into the videos. Also great interview with Michael Chapman from IDEO!, I felt that just like him I want to help other people and I can do it in this field.I have been inspired to create something, have plenty of ideas. But now I have the tools, thank you!One thing about the course is perhaps the thing in all coursera's classmates evaluation issues. For example: A value of 2 points including a persona's image - What if the person just made a completely different persona? - This was pretty hard to me 2 of my classmates enter wrong information about their persona and yet I was just evaluating if they have made it or not (0 or 2pts).",5
95751,I really like this course assignments.,4
95752,"A good instructor and interesting assignments, but the information presented was quite shallow. I don't feel that I learned much from this course.",1
95753,Very clear course with many exercices and a good combo with the other courses of this specialisation with the introduction of a different teacher,4
95754,"Highlight of the course was the interview with the IDEO researcher. It's great that you have actual people from the industry bringing their knowledge to the table, I really liked that.On the other hand, I think the course was in general too easy compared to the academic level of the previous courses of the specialization. Especially the assignments were not requiring the same amount of work / proof. For example conducting interviews would just require some written summary while previous courses required actually to record a full interview to soundcloud. I think the course was especially missing the assignment on prototyping, which would be really important. It was kindof just skipped and we students were not asked to actually build prototypes. I think the course should be harder and request more effort from the students.",4
95755,Professor Elizabeth is very excited for the subject and it's very contagious! UX: Reseach & Prototyping inspired me and helped me a lot with my own design process and how to do research better.Thank you very much!,5
95756,Very useful course!,5
95757,The course is very good.,4
95758,This course is well structured and engaging. I have learned a lot and the assignments were a great opportunity for me to put this new knowledge into practice - although it was a real challenge to complete the assignments beside my job. Now looking forward to the next chapter!,5
95759,"For some of the topics, the Introduction class has more meaningful homework projects. this felt a bit thin.",3
95760,"Great, thank you!",5
95761,"This was a kind of basic course without enough examples. That being said, the most interesting part of the course is prototyping section. I am looking forward to hearing more about that aspect of design.",3
95762,Really good course.Helped me understand the importance of interviews in making a productHelped me come up with many ideas for a single problemgave me a 260 degree view of user experience,5
95763,"I can't finish the friggin' course. I can code fluently in HTML, CSS and Javascript, but can't figure out how to upload a PDF assignment here. This student's user experience is atrocious.",1
95764,Learn about user research and ideas generation!,5
95765,"Assignments at times a bit hazy and there is very little guidance. In general the types of assignments do not lend themselves too well to peer review. This is far off the standard set by courses 1 and 2. Lectures seem a bit generic and although Liz Gerber tries to make it hands on, the subject matter really doesnt seem anywhere as tangible as when Klemmer presents it.",2
95766,Excellent!!! My time spent on this was worth it.,5
95767,"There could have been more content and the course been more challenging, otherwise loved it!",4
95768,This is a basic and introduction course to user experience and prototyping. The projects every week are pretty interesting and useful for you to think like designers. I hope there will be more detailed examples of design techniques in the video.,4
95769,Great course!,5
95770,"Assignments are ambiguously phrased and full of inconsistencies and typos. The last assignment does not provide feedback at all. It mainly felt like sitting in a lecture theatre getting a fragmented overview of the lecturer's work, while never gaining a real handle on the wider context, or what would have happened if an action hadn't been taken/had been performed differently. There was not enough further reading and no discussion of other people's work - such as a dissection of how a company might have arrived at a product we can actually identify in the wild.Rather than learning how I could tackle any project, I now know how to work on very specific examples of projects - if anything was to deviate from this, I'd still be clueless.Overall, the course feels haphazard and badly prepared.",1
95771,Very insightful!,5
95772,"Very good course, as a standalone course, some sections are slightly too short, but the information is great, very useful, nicely presented and works when put into practice. Thanks!",4
95773,"the course is just 5 minute video of an overview of the topic then an assignment,many topics are replicated from previous courses in the same speclization",2
95774,"Unfortunately I found this course to be the least enjoyable so far in the specialization. I'm not sure if I was just jarred by the change in instructor, but I found her manner of lecture to be almost belittling. I'm not sure if she's a mother or not, but that's the way she comes across--like she's trying to squeeze massive and advanced theory into a pill designed for ten year-olds.A majority of this class simply glossed over things we already learned in the intro class, and she would often list things she was going to talk about, and then ignore one of those items entirely. In fact, one of the most challenging assignments in this course was building a journey map, something that was mentioned in the lectures, but not gone into in depth at all. I tackled this challenge by sort of haphazardly googling journey maps and praying my submission would come across as somewhat logical.Ultimately I'm very disappointed with this part of the specialization. I don't feel like it was worth my $39, and would love to see this class completely redesigned for future learners. Research and prototyping is arguably one of the most important things for a burgeoning UX designer to learn, and this class could stand to be a lot more in depth.",2
95775,Very useful. I liked the presentation that contains summary of what the teacher said in the video.,5
95776,"Excellent Course! Thank you very much!If we can have access to the answers to the quiz after everyone submits the results, that will be great.",5
95777,It is a really good course that gracefully integrates the know how and real life testimonials for creating a technology startup.,5
95778,This course does not meet my needs and expectations. The content is very focused on engineering projects. The exercise demands a lot of time to understand the document. It would be better to slice it in many exercises associated with each week.,1
95779,cool,4
95780,"Very instructive, both theoretical (teachers) and practical (entrepreneurs) aspects are developed in this concise, affordable, well designed MOOC.",5
95781,Perfect for me !,5
95782,Useful tips and relevant business case.,4
95783,This is a great platform to learn such complex topics broken down into small segments which helps to absorb and apply the knowledge in our respected work fields.I am very optimistic to complete all 6 of the course and by then I will actually learn some valuable things which I can apply in my own field of work.,5
95784,"The material is very randomized, and the instructor presents it in an overly complex way.",1
95785,"It is a good introductory course, but it relies too much on networks and could be confusing and demoralizing if you intend to pursue a career in systems biology.",2
95786,Ravi is a great researcher. This class is taught with great clarity and expertise. Subtitle is much less impressive though.,5
95787,A very useful course!,4
95788,"The required readings are stellar. I didn't know all this stuff, and there's a real open-source philosophy. The bio stuff is challenging for an engineer like myself, but worth Googling and learning in the long run",5
95789,It's very helpful!,5
95790,I could not understand instructor. Using subtitles didn't help either as many words came up unintelligible.,1
95791,Very very very interesting!!! First step in a new field.,5
95792,Very very informative course for the beginners like me!,4
95793,"It's a great overview, but somehow i didn't feel like it stuck even though i did put in effort to read the articles assigned starting halfway through the course.Maybe it's because there's so much material that will be covered in a hands on part in the 3rd and 4th parts of this specialization... Would definitely recommend it to everyone interested in biotechnology and systems biology.",4
95794,The lectures were somehow chaotic.,3
95795,"Great course! The only change i would ask for: after the test, could you let us see the correct response to the questions we got wrong? Thanks!",4
95796,"Nice course, a little boring at the beginning with so much data about cell signaling, (kinases names, and specific routes).",5
95797,Very useful course in order to learn the basics in systems biology. You only need some training in biology to understand the concepts but the course is easy to follow and very complete.,5
95798,A good step to learn this area.,5
95799,"With a biology background I had some difficulty following this course. That is understandable, as a lot of it relies in mathematical modelling and statistics. I still felt like some exam questions relied on material not yet lectured, which would sometimes leave me at a loss as to how I should have gotten to the right question in the first place. The lectures could have been structured differently, so as to facilitate engagement - I found myself easily losing focus and having to repeat the videos. Despite its shortcomings, the course is still a powerful introduction to Systems Biology.",3
95800,Great course! It explains very generally but clearly all different aspects involved in Systems Biology. The material used is good and so are the articles used for learning.,5
95801,a bit to hard for an introduction cours,4
95802,"Boring voice. A lot of overcomplicated terms, where you can describe your idea in a much more simple way. In result i feel that lector read this material not to teach people, but just to read it. Disgusting.",1
95803,"The lecture quality should be dramatically improved. Even at 2x speed, I feel Iyengar should further practice is presentation and redo the videos. In the conclusion, Iyengar states that no textbooks are available for the field because it is ""new"", but an Amazon search shows several seem to exist, and many of the studies referenced in this course are years old, even more than a decade in some cases... so I think better materials for more organized slides must exist. I've taken more than 5 coursera classes, and this has been my least satisfying. ... I do appreciate the introduction this provided, for free, and plan to keep learning in this space, though not in this course sequence.",2
95804,Great work,5
95805,Great course.,5
95806,"Is this a fabulous course, complete, that covers many areas of business strategy. I recommend.",5
95807,good insights. not sure what i really got out of the course though,5
95808,"Great information, templates and tools to develop business strategy. Instructors are exceptional! Thank you.",5
95809,Loved the deep thought processes this course explored; planning through to Implementation of complex strategies in real life scenarios adding value to any operations minded professional.,5
95810,Very good course ..,5
95811,"I'm new to Business Strategy, with previous background in Engineering. The course seriously lacks notes and proper definitions of the concepts. You will have to do your own research to understand the definitions. Also, you are expected to review 3 other projects. When you are a student yourself, how can you be expected to fairly grade your peers? I'm really not sure how useful this is going to be towards actually using it. I mean, will an employer find this useful? I don't know.",3
95812,great introductory course. i been able to apply these concepts in my work.,4
95813,"Great Course! However, not so happy with scoring methods",4
95814,"Excellent,thanks",5
95815,Its a beautiful course with practical examples and demonstrations. One of the best courses at Coursera!!,5
95816,A comprehensive specialization for advanced business strategy.Very professional course from a world class university.,5
95817,Awesome fundamentals on Corporate Strategy ..refreshed my MBA skills,5
95818,"Useful course, really helpful to my consulting case interview",5
95819,A very good course to take to further deepen your knowledge about business strategies.,5
95820,"Really advanced thinking in strategy, excellent work by Darden Business School. Particular appreciation for Prof. Jared D. Harris and Mike Lenox for their competency in the subject matter.",5
95821,Thank you to the professors and this has been a good value add to my knowledge!,5
95822,"Very well structured, valuable content/tools and concise (to the point).",5
95823,Excellent follow up on Foundations... Look forward to other courses in Specialization...,5
95824,well prepared course with very clear material. Thank you,5
95825,Fantastic! Peter!,5
95826,"A great course, very good methodology, the explanation of teachers is very clear, the examples used are of great help in understanding the course topics. It fully met expectations.",5
95827,"Wonderful course, great material and well laid out! Professors, Cases, Examples have all been extremely beneficial",5
95828,"I enjoyed taking the class... the video lectures were great with clear real life examples. One of the better classes I have taken i CourseraOne suggestion : rather than just reading a case study weekly, we can do some analysis like PEST or 5 Forces and have a peer review. This builds confidence towards capstone.",5
95829,"This course is exceptional it gives the better understanding of Business strategy, i wonder why university credits are being denied for someone who has successfully passed courses like these, may the authorities reconsider their decision.",5
95830,Really good course!,5
95831,Excellent course. Recommend it to anyone who would like to grow professionally.Thank you and very grateful to all the professors!!,5
95832,The content was very good and informative. It just that I couldn't relate the later part of the module as I have not been a part of any industry as such.,4
95833,This is an excellent course and the professors have presented the subject in a lucid manner. It is quite easy to understand the concepts and particularly applying those concepts to the assignments is an immense learning experience.,5
95834,As always both professors deliver a clear and user-friendly experience in the business strategy world. Great cases and case reviews. very enjoyable course.,5
95835,its my first course. its amazingthanks for making this possible,5
95836,"Hi,The course lessons are practical, with case studies that helps you to internalize the concepts and visualize ways that you can apply it realistic examples.",5
95837,Another great class. Really gets you thinking. I doubt I will unlearn anything from this course. Good stuff.,5
95838,Excellent course and teacher. Congratulations!!,5
95839,"My first course on Coursera was Fundamentals of Business Strategy, by professor M. Lenox. When I saw this course coming, I had no doubt I have to take it. I like it for being short, compressed, professional and straight to the point!",4
95840,Thanks for valuable tools!,5
95841,"Very useful and valuable course! Easy to understan, clear and interesting manner of teaching of both course instructors. Worth passing if you are interested in business and strategy.",5
95842,Very useful course!,4
95843,A brilliant course. Well taught and well laid out.,5
95844,"Great course for both beginners with no prior experience (other than Statistical Reasoning 1) and intermediate-to-advanced biostatisticians (like me) seeking a refresher. Professor John McGready does a fantastic job explaining fundamental biostatistics concepts and methodologies in an easy-to-understand, example-rich way, while keeping you on your toes with interesting side notes, helpful practice tests/homework, and a memorable sense of humor.",5
95845,Great course to improve your skills related to statistical data analysis focused on health domain,5
95846,Good practice exercices and with detailed solutions,5
95847,"Good course for understanding the basical mechanics behind regression analysis, mainly logistic, linear and Cox proportional hazards.It will not, though, discuss how to do it in statistical packages.",5
95848,"This course provides a strong foundation for understanding regression analysis. It covers both simple and multiple regression that can be applied to either linear, logistic, or Cox regression models. Prof. McGready guides you from estimation to interpretation of regression coefficients through different kinds of literature examples. In addition, you learn how to choose the best model, how to assess confounding, and how to investigate effect modification. Awesome course!",5
95849,Wonderful course with wonderful instructors,5
95850,may be the best of the 6 modules,5
95851,An overall fulfilling experience! I enjoyed this course thoroughly and after finishing it I feel myself many steps closer towards higher studies in the same discipline. :),5
95852,Wonderful course!,5
95853,Great course with lots of input. Proper learning and dedication to the work.,5
95854,"I think this was an extremely practical course, with information about how to run the sprints, and a lot of details to support the preparation and running of the actual sprints.",5
95855,"I'm really getting into these courses. I find the instructor really good and engaging, especially given it's online",5
95856,I took the course without certificate and learned and lot. Material and videos are thorough and extensively understandable .,5
95857,This is a great source for new ideas in how to built fine products.,4
95858,"Great course about product design sprints, indispensable for agile managing. The quality of the content of the course is superb and the learners too. I highly recommend it.",5
95859,"I've begun using the lessons taught in this class, which has resulted in great success. Thank you Alex for providing this information. Thank you Coursera for establishing the platform in which these lessons are delivered.",5
95860,"I think that the information for the assignments must be more clear, templates for the tasks needs revision.",3
95861,Really good course about running product design sprints. Thank you!,5
95862,"If the lecture may speak a little bit slowly than he has, it will be much better. The content is very useful. And the questions at end of each session are very helpful for me to recap the course.",5
95863,"This course is very valuable and relevant (in current time). The course very elegantly brings design thinking, lean startup and Agile methodology together in one practice.",5
95864,I have learned alot from this course even though I have no experience using it at all. But now I am starting to use it and I go over at it all the time. Thanks Coursera!,5
95865,Excellent. Very practical training using Design sprints,5
95866,After ending all weeks and made all task I clearly see the agile path. I know - what direction I should chose and what I should do during the road.,5
95867,Top notch. This instructor is terrific. Really uses the Coursera platform to optimal effect.,5
95868,Good course. Few things towards the end of course were not quite clear to me.,4
95869,Course is good and they are working hard on having advisors available.,4
95870,"This course does an excellent job of breaking down the components of design sprints, offering an actionable formula for those new to this method of experimentation.",5
95871,Nice pace and videos well divided in an interesting and logical progression.,5
95872,"Really interesting course. I actually thought it was at least as good as the first and followed up on that material nicely. Overall, the content is extremely practical and gives you everything you need to plan and run a design",5
95873,Having successfully completed 'Getting Started: Agile Meets Design Thinking' I found this module partially confusing. It is also based on Alex Cowans' venture design process but this time on each step you do things that differ from what was taught in the previous course. Things seem to be complementary but you should not expect to go through a structured process over all courses. They are all based on the same process but shed light on different aspects.I also have the imporession that the didactics of this second course still coudl be improved a lot. Quizzes are currently reworked and bugs fixed and the team is very responsive.It still was a good learning experience and doing Design sprints is a great approach. From the review of assignments I can say that a few students seem to adapt better to the structure of the course that I did. But most seemed to be equally if not more confused. Doing reviews wasn't fun because formally most students got enough points but content-wise I perceived it as rather messy assignments to review. :/,3
95874,Pretty good material.,5
95875,"A practical, useful course on how to actually run these sessions. If you've run a design workshop, I think you'll appreciate the level of detail. If you're not going to run a design sprint or any kind of workshop in the next few months, maybe you skip over some of the checklists. That said, the main point of the course is practical preparation for doing these type of sessions, and for that I think it's very good.",5
95876,The course demonstrated a very thorough and practical way to implement the content learned in Course One. I especially liked that the course walked through an example from start to finish so you could explore each step of the sprint with a familiar problem scenario.,5
95877,"I thought it was good. Design sprints are popular but in practice there's a lot of detail you're left to figure out for yourself. The level of detail here was helpful for getting started.I would recommend taking their Course 1 (Agile and Design Thinking)- this seems to assume you know those concepts, which I guess is fair enough since it is one of Coursera's specializations.",5
95878,I posted questions and couldn't find any answer. The course also doesn't allow me to be creative (although it's about design!) in answering assignments.,1
95879,"I only did week one of the course and quit for the following reasons:Presentation of the content is too fast and provides little information among lots of noise. Most of what's said is generic keywords assembled in sentences that don't make much sense, or implies ""common sense"" evidences barely illustrated with vague figures and no sources to support them. It makes everything hard to follow for beginners and unconvincing for more advanced students.On top of that, I feel offended by the mysogynist examples and the underlying contradictory assumptions that designers outside of agile are basically incompetent while saying at the same time that they will just use methods they already know anyway.",1
95880,"This course can give you hands on advice on how to manage a sprint that solve a design issue. For my taste most of the information is far too specific and tied to one scenario. It's ok to present a detailed schedule with a number of minutes for breaks; it's also ok to assume a certain mind set for ""your manager"". However, I am missing the occasional bird's eye view, like how did we come to these conclusions and where do other team leads (maybe from different cultures) vary from these rules. In conclusion I would recommend the Agile course from Alberta University instead.",2
95881,One of the best courses in this specialization,5
95882,very useful,5
95883,very professional best in web!!,5
95884,very usefull course,5
95885,Creat teachers,5
95886,Great for the beginners to study about data structure,5
95887,Just read PPT,3
95888,Great class! Some quiz problems and coding problems are pretty difficult.,5
95889,thank you very much for this course. i had a really great time studying it and i hope this course will be useful for me in the future,5
95890,Very detailed and comprehensive material. Tests and exercices are a perfect support in order to reinforce the content.,5
95891,Very well put together course.,5
95892,"This was a great course and very relevant and useful. A big thanks to the lectures, UNSW and Coursera!",5
95893,Best choise for engineers!,5
95894,"Great course. It's very useful for people who are having the first contact with Systems Engineering. Very didatic. It really changed the way I see my area. I do recommend this course. It's challenging enough for not being tedious, and not too difficult to make us to give up. Congratulations!",5
95895,"The course outline is very good, however the presentation (especially the slides) can be monotonous. The usage of various system engineering terminologies and jargon can be intimidating at times. Appreciate the instructors intention of keeping the videos and material very digestible on a weekly basis, I would suggest them to include more case studies and activities, from the professional realm as well. I would also suggest them to bring in the awareness of various tools that are used throughout the systems engineering process. It is still an excellent course and would highly recommend to any engineer out there.",5
95896,Wonderful course: very detailed and informative. Absolutely worth taking. Highly recommended!,5
95897,"Great course! Well prepared, brief and to the point!",5
95898,I think it is a best course to,5
95899,This is an great introduction course for Systems Engineering. I wish I had known it before! Thanks for all the team who has developed it!,5
95900,A relly good introduction to System Engineering.,5
95901,It was a very good and interactive course by UNSW and coursera.I got to learn all the basics of system engineering.I would recommend it to everyone to atleast go through the course plan.This course helps in daily life also as we learn how to tackle and solve problems more conveniently and in a better and efficient way,5
95902,Excellent overview of the systems engineering methodology.,5
95903,A very well structured and presented,5
95904,"I am a Saudi engineer who found this course pretty amazing course , never ever gone through similar course, indeed, I will revisit and pay for it; reliable and sound basics of IE and Systems, looking for advanced course for the same or better coach to include them on my 2017/2018 developmental plan in coursera.I will send you my comments although I am not among top scored due to lack of time and lacking the good time management skills.However I am confident that I t will be of helpful as I am 12 years of experience in gas ,oil and energy projects management and quality in leading energy companies in Saudi Arabia in addition to hold master degree of engineering management in 2014.Thank you very much outstanding instructors and professorsMobasher , K.S.A -Jeddah Citystudent",5
95905,Very broad and concise approach to teaching Systems Engineering as an introduction. There is a lot of material available but this one has helped me to figure out the most important parts of the system development life cycle and where to search for more information. Thanks!,5
95906,Great app,5
95907,Excellent course. Thorough analysis of systems engineering.,5
95908,Thanks a lot to Dr Mike Ryan and Dr Ian Faulconbridge for this excellent MOOC.,5
95909,Very helpful course for those who want both to get more theoretical information and learn practical foundation of Business Analysis. I recommend this course as a part of preparations to Certification of Competency in Business Analysis exam.,5
95910,This is excellent and interesting course. The knowledge is need to many,5
95911,"This course gives a lot of insights into the SE activities, which we normally don't notice. This would be useful for the system developers as well System Safety engineers to appreciate the system",5
95912,Highly recommended course for all engineers. A real eye opener for me! Concepts have been explained clearly and with great examples. The extension exercises are a great way of learning and also the peer review lets you learn from others! I really enjoyed the course material and lessons by both the course instructors. Thanks a lot for the valuable knowledge!,5
95913,"The best thing about this course is paying attention to basis of SE. I studied some books and courses up to now, no one was better than this course.",5
95914,"Very well made, great contents. The only reason I removed a star is it seemed to me there was more topics in the quizes than in the course itself in the first part. It was a bit confusing and the quizes required to look up information on the internet and there was no real way to know these topics would be in the quizes. Otherwise, I enjoyed the class and learned a gread deal.",4
95915,"Excellent course! The content is great in quality, quantity and structure!! 5 stars to that! However, I am giving 4 stars since passing the course or not depends mostly on Extension Exercises, which at the beginning seem to be optional but they in fact mandatory.",4
95916,Very good content and delivered in an effective manner. Lots of information and examples are quite valuable and not provided in the slides so I recommend everyone to have the handouts at hand when studying for the assignments and exams.,5
95917,The course is totally magnificent. It helps me a lot. :-),5
95918,Excellent course of Introduction to Systems Engineering,5
95919,"It is not easy to teach a methodology, knowing that the students come from very different backgrounds and system domains. The instructors were able to teach the concepts with the right pace and to provide examples which were easy to follow. In my opinion, a key success criterion for the course is the chosen running example: a dwelling. Every student, independent from background and system domain, can relate to it and apply the methodology. Because of the dwelling example, students could review the work of other students and don't get confused by a system domain they don't understand. It is worthwhile to mention that the course material is based on ISO 15288 and ISO 29148. I can highly recommend the course as an introduction to Systems Engineering.",5
95920,Frequent and forced peer reviews with no opportunity to complete once deadline is missed makes this course nu-necessarily difficult for people with conflicting schedules and responsibilities.,1
95921,its good to learn this subject free of cost and amazing teaching method.,5
95922,"I just love this university, this course and this subject.",5
95923,Excellent class! Highly recommended to anyone who wants to learn the basics of business strategy. Professor Somay is a subject matter expert and his lectures are wonderful. Many thanks!,5
95924,Easy to learn with general concept within the business strategy's knowledge.,4
95925,Great course! Excellent professor.,5
95926,Learned a lof new things.,5
95927,Very interesting course. Thank you!,5
95928,"outstanding course. Efficient, strategic, very well structured and, what I especially like, it feels very personal because of those additional snippets like interviews, reports from football field. Great case studies. One of the best courses I've taken. Absolutely recommend it to anyone interested in introductory business strategy questions.",5
95929,THANK YOU!,5
95930,The best course I've taken on Coursera. Really should be considered as the epitome of how Coursera business courses are done. Extremely well laid out with excellent slides and the best transcripts I've seen. Tests and assignments are thoughtful and not full of trick questions. Writing essays as memo format another great touch. Bravo!!!,5
95931,Yet to complete the course but got inspired by intro lecture of Prof Somaya ! Awesome.,5
95932,Made business strategy understand very easily and in simple language by Prof Deepa Somaya.,5
95933,"A teacher, who really knows and understands the subject)",5
95934,Great course - learn a lot,4
95935,I really enjoyed the case studies in this course and the education on various frameworks felt like I could immediately use the material in real world scenarios. Highly recommended course materials.,5
95936,"I really like the course however it was too short and generic, and writing a memo as a repetation of the course was not that exhilarating...I haven´t used the discussion forums too much however I was expecting more on building business models...Probably it will be the subject of the next package but still 3 courses were too little as coverage....I really liked the alagories and interviews from real life experiences and thank you for the effort...",2
95937,Very good overview of the relevant concepts,5
95938,Very useful information,5
95939,"Fantastic course! ( always suggest to take the courses in sequence, but this one can be a stand alone course as well). I'm definately taking the next course as well! Very high quality of teaching as well as materials and other resources.",5
95940,Very practical and relevant course... I recommand it for all new entrepreneurs,5
95941,Great insight on business strategy which will enable me to conduct better analysis in my daily work. I highly recommend this course and this specializat,5
95942,"I had no idea how much I needed this course until I finished it! This Capstone is a must-do, for any business owner, because it requires you to understand your business in such a valuable way. Marketing is one of the most expensive elements of a business and, because Social Media is the most effective way to target a market, having an overview of how it works will make hiring your Social Media manager a less confusing experience and will help you understand your target market and its needs from a different perspective. Although I now have the tools and certification (yay!) to work in Social Marketing, this course showed me that it may not actually be my dream job, but that's a good thing for my company because I now know how to save money on marketing, how to create an actionable marketing budget, and how to listen to my market. I use the tools I learned in this course and from all the courses in this certificate series, but especially this course, over and over again as I continue to pitch and raise money for my company. Professor Hlavac truly enjoys teaching and, once I can afford it, I hope to be able to hire one of his students because he inspires greatness, rigor, and joy in Social Media Marketing, so I assume his students will as well!",5
95943,Great course. Loved the content and its delivery.,5
95944,"Why I think the Capstone Project is a great thing? How it brings the info from all of the previous courses in the Social Media Marketing Specialization together in one be picture. Basically, in this project you take all the knowledge and tools you've been given and put them together, which Professor Hlavac shows you very well how to do this step by step. The Excel spreadsheet examples you use are not difficult, but might like overwhelming for newbie. I would definitely use that tool for future social media strategies. I honestly, can't say enough for how professional and helpful Professor Hlavac is, I wish they could clone him for other courses. What an excellent communicator and I'm still amazed how quickly he responds to his students questions and remarks. I admire his work and his approach to making me feel as if I am his only students where there are thousands that take this specialization. I'm a little sad it over now. I enjoyed learning the material and I will be proud to have a certification from Northwestern University via Cousera. I'm also impressed with Northwestern University from what I've experienced in this specialization. Also, I'm sure I will refer back to the tools and the materials when working on a social media campaign.",5
95945,Just great.,5
95946,I am very grateful for the course. The fact that it gathered all the information and applied it to a meaningful experience helped me learn the material. I wish the professor would have given me constructive feedback on the project,5
95947,It was an insightful course which looked at key strategies most often ignored by social marketers. Randy did a great job on that excel sheet for the capstone project! Thank you.,4
95948,Thank you to all the team for such an amazing course. I love each one course within the Social Media Marketing. Really great.,5
95949,"Awesome specialization!I highly recommend, Professor Randy Hlavac taught us methodologies and useful tools for this project and for future projects in Social marketing with the Capstone project I can recognize that social marketing is an integral part of a business strategy.He was always great! I learned a lot in this specialization now I have a bigger vision for my future learning and for my startup.Thanks, Professor Randy, Northwester University and Coursera.",5
95950,Very very useful,5
95951,Awesome !! Thanks for a great learning project.,5
95952,Excellent introduction to marketing budgets,5
95953,The videos are great and the downloads made making sense of it all much easier. The Excel spreadsheets are very pragmatic and can easily be used for building out future social marketing plans.,5
95954,"Holy cow, the capstone project is amazing! I presented it to my boss, who has asked me to present my plan to the Senior Leadership Team in 2 weeks.",5
95955,"I think it is a great course which combines all the theory from the other courses that make up this specialization. I like the peer reviews since it gives you more insight into the subject matter from other points of view, however I do think that qualitative feedback from an instructor would be a serious plus that is lacking in the current set-up.",5
95956,Randy Hlavac is an amazing instructor! Great course!,5
95957,"Good explanations and good examples. Worth it! Even I already know about TDD, I learned a lot here.",5
95958,"It is more like a Junit course in the beginning or as far as i could watch. The methodology is not very precise and I could think in a few enhancements.Still, I could recommend for those who want just a initial contact with the method. No more than this.",1
95959,it's ok,3
95960,Very good course. The only thing that i'd like to mention is that sometimes the enunciate of the exercises is not so clear.,4
95961,very knowledgeable,5
95962,This course is understanding water and sanitation through the lens of economics. Lacked water and sanitation element through infectious disease (biological lens). I guess that is why its water supply and sanitation POLICY.,3
95963,A very informative course. You don't need to have any previous knowledge on the subject to understand the terms.,4
95964,"Thank you so much, what a great course! Thank you so much to firstly founders of this platform Coursera Mrs. Koller and Mr. Ng; then Mr. Larsen, to all contributors, supporters, I'm so appreciated that I could have taken this course! You're such a beautiful and amazing community! You really helped me so much to make my dreams come true. Thank you again for all!Best regards and best wishes,Zeynepgül Bayrı",5
95965,"While the content of this course was presented in an engaging way, the assessment task lacks context. To then be asked to peer review others based on this is particularly disengaging.",2
95966,"Second part of the specialization, this course will talk about Strategy Formulation. Like the first course, it's clear, concese with a final exam that lead us slowly to the the capstone project.",5
95967,"The Course is a great imprimer for Strategy Formulation. It has a lot of ""real life examples"" and a clear explaination of the main concepts!",5
95968,Excellent course with rich content and accurate delivery method. The subject was well delivered with simple analysis and pertinent references from real live business environment,5
95969,Perfect course,5
95970,Great class!,5
95971,"The course gave a nice overview on strategy formulation but was in my view a bit inconsistent. However I learned the main techniques used in formulation, so no regrets.",3
95972,"Course 1 was really enriching, but this second stage didn't achieve the level that it's supposed, videos should be remake in order to connect with learners, materials should be upgrade to fulfill expectations.",1
95973,Awesome class! A lot can be learned within a short period time here. The instructor's knowledge and command is extraordinary!,5
95974,"great material , great teacher",5
95975,I enjoyed this course and had fun applying the principles I learnt for the assignment. The video sessions were amazing and a huge thank you to our mentor!,5
95976,there's a lot to learn.,4
95977,The course content is presented in a very good way. It is explained in an understandable way and examples provide a good insight. The final assignment is ambiguously described. This is very frustrating if you invest a lot of time and recognize that all classmates proceeded in a different way.,1
95978,I wish teachers look at our work too rather than student though they do their jobs.,3
95979,It was an amazing experience! I´m sure I will soon use all I learned!thank you very much!,5
95980,"Contetnt is great, however sometimes it was really hard to listen presenter and see repeating gestures that confuses and not clear where is the main point.",4
95981,"Very insightful course, broaden my horizon over the new age of strategy formulation.",4
95982,Amazing course. Anyone can learn if interested. Appreciative lecture. Thanks.,4
95983,"Great course , It has a lot of topics you can use in the future that will help you improve your company's performance.",4
95984,Excellent case studies very helpful in demonstrating theories,4
95985,Really interesting course with real applications in the work environment. Highly recommended!,5
95986,"I felt the course was ok, but wanted more. It seemed very general, even with the focus in the end on e-Types.",3
95987,I think the level was a bit on the low side and the time i had to spend on each week was far less compared with the first module. Videos maintain high standard.,3
95988,There were the occasional moments when I had a hard time clearly understanding what the lecturer meant. Otherwise pretty good.,4
95989,great tool and greatly structured,5
95990,Loved it. In-depth framework on how to formulate the theories of strat,5
95991,strategy formulation is an excellent course,5
95992,"The speaking style and body language of the instructor was quite monotonous when teaching the content. For the most part of the course, it felt like the instructor was just ""reading"" the teleprompter without blinking for several seconds! He did not attempt to teach the students in these videos. It could have been MUCH better if he had used better presentation tools and shorter sentences.",2
95993,Wonderful course and I strongly recommend it for management.,5
95994,"Teacher is good, also the contens are very interesting. However i felt the capstone must be clearer in order to follow the previous one. They have both the same situation, but there is something missing between capstone 1 and 2. Maybe it is the way it is conceibed, the questions were not clear at all.",4
95995,Excellent learning experience. Excellence use of forum (next to Quizzes) for self reflection on new knowledge and interactions with other students.,5
95996,"This course was more diverse than I thought it would be and I really enjoyed it, however I thought the end of year project could have provided more differentiated prep material as that confused me.",3
95997,Excellent course. Great learning. Top Notch facility. Definitely recommended for somebody who want to learn Strategy Formulation in detail.,5
95998,good concepts,4
95999,Excellent course building on previous learning . Excellent case studies,4
96000,"Good introduction to the basics of strategy formulation - includes some basic concepts in defining strategy, a few concepts related to strategy analysis and strategic decision making. Course ends with an opportunity to demonstrate learning objectives through a capstone case on E-Types design agency.",4
96001,Great course!,5
96002,"The course content itself was good, however the final assignment was vague and confusing. I think my coursemates had the same problem; all of the submissions I reviewed failed to discuss in any way at least one of the learning objectives.",3
96003,Great class. Really learned a lot.,5
96004,Good examples and themes.,5
96005,Not too much different information from what can be found in internet for free.If it was cheaper the relationship cost-quality could improve.,3
96006,I'm blown away by the content of this course and what I've learned. I took a strategy class before but the content in this one is so clear and well explained.,5
96007,"Very interesting, very professional course, I loved it! :) Many thanks!",5
96008,"This is a very simple, brief and useful course.The modules are short, concise but do not go into lot of details. Is a good course to audit/browse for free but may not be good enough against a verified option. Anyways, paying for verified course is subject to personal value derivation.While I had rated earlier for the above reasons before the course finished. I am facing the exact same problem with this course as I faced with earlier course.The grading process is badly constructed for final assignment. In fact, now I am learning from coursera staff that may be there are not enough students to grade my peer review assignment.So please do audit this course but do not be trapped in specialization.Cheers..",2
96009,"Very down-to-earth and hands-on approach for a subject that - in the wrong hands - might be very abstract. I think that examples, companies and questions were challenging and entertaining. I learned a lot and have built my strategy tool kit around this course.",5
96010,Well put together course with relevant and interesting supplementary reading. A delight to participate.,5
96011,Thank you you are great,5
96012,Thanks,5
96013,The materials were interesting and relevant. The instructions for the final project were a bit cryptic - it was not completely clear what the instructor wanted. The submissions I reviewed were all over the board and none came close to the grading rubric,3
96014,I really liked the style of learning as well as the course content which gives me a broad overview of formulation of strategies.,5
96015,"Huge difference reading feedback from peers. Videos short and sweet. Will love to have recommended extra reading, videos, etc.",5
96016,A very good follow-up to the strategic management course in the strategic management specialisation. I had fun learning everything.,4
96017,The course is very clear on its objectives and well explained!,5
96018,"This was a tough one. Thank you for adopting case studies like Vestas and Carlsberg to help us understand various aspects of formulation. More importantly, pitfalls to be avoided.",5
96019,"This is excellent course, the only reason why I am rating 4 stars because it does not allow you take the quizes",4
96020,Another good course from Copenhagen University... Must join..,5
96021,Good experience of learning.,5
96022,Excellent sessions and good instruction.,5
96023,Could be improved.. the ideas seem disconnected there is no clear flow of the ideas presented in different weeks and the specific actions to formulate a strategy. but overall good course with excellent frameworks. Thanks a lot Coursera,3
96024,I love this course! This is the best specialization I've taken so far.,5
96025,"The professor isn't that great, and really difficult to follow (high speed, English pronunciation not obvious). The assignment was also really similar to the",2
96026,Too few students.,3
96027,Great quality lectures and fun real life examples! Would be even better if more structured background literature was given and more connections were being drawn between coursework from different weeks.,4
96028,"I give this course a 5-star review. The learning strikes a perfect balance between challenging one's limits and being relaxed and enjoyable. I feel relaxed in the course, but at the same time I feel like it's always 1% beyond my reach, which really pushes me to work harder! It stretches my own limitations and encourages me to excel, without being too much to handle. I think that this course belongs amongst the top elite courses offered by Coursera. Bravo!",5
96029,It was a very good experience to take this course. Thank you!,4
96030,Very practical course with a lot of interesting info. Excellent performance of the videos.,5
96031,Great and clear Week 1 Presentation !,5
96032,"I only dislike the fact that wasn't very clear the instructions for the final project, every work I reviewed and also mine, were very different, I think that everybody understand a different thing, and that wouldn't happen if the instructions were clear.",4
96033,At times a direct contrast the the precursor class. Assignments too easy. Lectures okay but syllabus lacked structure. Too easy. Wasted time.,2
96034,Excellent insight into the language and dynamics of strategy formulation.,5
96035,Great Course!,5
96036,Interesting but not really practical. This module could benefit of more examples when it comes to formulating strategies.,3
96037,"Great education and a very good setup, but the final assignment is very vague, so it's challenging. I think that when a professor gives a vague assignment, he should be the one grading the work, because peer grading only works best when they know exactly what they are supposed to be grading.",5
96038,Great course with good material and lecturer,4
96039,Really comprehensive course. Well worth doing.,5
96040,Excelent course and teachers!! Congratulations!!,5
96041,Very interesting courses,5
96042,"I really enjoyed the Professor's presentation style, and the format of the course (quizzes with one large assignment at the end). It would have been helpful however to have had the slides available for download.",5
96043,this course learn a lot of thing to me and give me many new idea,4
96044,"Nice form, shallow content. Simply too simple. Beware: upgrade / fee required for last two exams.",1
96045,The Course is very easy to follow and information presented is meaningful and up to date manner.,5
96046,Very useful to learn the basics of social media analysis (twitter and youtube) with python and R.It's a good course to start.,5
96047,"The course material should be provided on coursera itself. Instead of having to download a 1.8GB dataset from yelp, the two files could have been shared here.",4
96048,"A good, basic introduction to Social Media Data Analytics",3
96049,"I'd like to give just one star rating for this course, as it is very far from what I expected. The course expect students to know Python, to know R, but did not go deep enough to help students understand the insight from social media data. In fact, lots of R task can be replaced with Python, so the course could be designed in a much better way that students do not always switch between two programming environments. This course mainly teaches how to download data with keywords, and how to plot graph, not worth the effort of learning. Therefore, I would not recommend this course to anyone.",1
96050,"Far from being a real course, it need polishing, at this point it looks more like a basic tutorial with a few error, perhaps next versions will be better.",1
96051,"Good overview, could be more robust and thorough!",3
96052,This is an inroductory cousre tou,4
96053,It can be more exhaustive..,3
96054,"Interesting course, could have added a bit more on how to write basic scripts or more ways of social media analytics",4
96055,"Tips you into the direction of great resources, but sometimes lacks in the explanations, leaving most code not explained. Not a deal breaker, and a worthy introduction but a more detailed explanation at times would help.",4
96056,An amazing course that was just what I was looking for as a violinist who is interested in learning to teach. My kids are working through the curriculum now and we are all having a great time!,5
96057,Stellar! Great concepts explained well and demonstrated on real students. Will help me immensely in my own teaching.,5
96058,Incredibly helpful. Thank you.,5
96059,It is a really good course. I learned a lot. It is an essencial tool for teachers. Thank you,5
96060,"This course has been immensely helpful in teaching how to teach the violin. I recently started teaching violin lessons and I am so much more confident about instructing my students correctly from the beginning, thanks to this course. It was fantastic to see the teaching happening, making the course practical, not just theoretical. Thank you!",5
96061,"Ms. Spencer and the team are wonderful; the videos are well produced, and all the handouts and music with accompaniment have been priceless.",5
96062,"This pedagogy course is great, but I think it is missing real students learning the current lesson... I feel that the students try just one, and make it perfect, they already know... The teacher could show us how to eliminate their difficulties... Almost 5 stars!",4
96063,"Great Course, a lot of tools and information, very well presented",5
96064,top knotch! great learning tools and instruction was easy to follow! Thank you!,5
96065,I loved this course. It helped me very much and I'm grateful for everything I learned here.The only thing I think need to be improved is the evaluation system.Can't wait for my next course!,4
96066,So thorough and informative!,5
96067,"I am very grateful for Stacia Spencer and Northwestern University for taking the time to put this course on Coursera. The videos, google hangouts, and supplementary materials have been incredibly helpful and opened my eyes to another side of violin pedagogy.",5
96068,"Best course for music teachers and students as well. From this course one can learn basic to advanced things and proper method to play the instrument. The instructor also teaches the lessons interestingly in a new way, and shares many good different techniques to learn by heart the tunes.",5
96069,Great course!,5
96070,Very EXCELLENT course,5
96071,An excellent resource for violin teachers!!!,5
96072,It's very helpful. I'm so luckily to meet this course.,5
96073,I am really satisfied with the class. I love your teaching techniques. Thank you really.,5
96074,The early stage of violin learning is usually thought to be much more difficult than any other kinds of instruments such as piano. I had not expected that violin could be taught so smoothly in such a systematic and scientific way until I enrolled in this course. Ms Spencer introduced a series of skills not only to prevent those common bad habits but also to make the violin learning so fascinating especially for young kids.,5
96075,"This MOOC has taught me new ways to approach violin teaching, especially with younger kids. It showed the basic principles as well as different skills and techniques that are essential/ important in teaching and playing. It gave a wide variety of fun exercises for students. This course gave me new insight in violin teaching that I can confidently apply with my students.",5
96076,Excellent and very complete class,5
96077,"A rather non-engaged teacher ho does not know what goes on with the reviews. She does not have enough people to review the written assignment and the assignments go UN-reviewed leading to a 'no-grade' whihc is ridiculous. It is not even clear how the written reviews are graded. She is not involved and does not serve to inspect the work of the students to ascertain that a grade is in order. Three reviews are requited for a grade, but she has so few reviewers that one might only get one review and then fail. Very inept. Stay away from this one. She does not get involved with answering questions of students either. Her internet activity is rated a 2/5 whihc I did not know until I got involved with this course. Observation of the video showing her teaching is terrible. She places herself in front of the camera and one cannot see the placement of the student's fingers or most importantly what is actually happening on the fret board with the finger movement. She also places herself directly in front of the camera blocking a clear view of everything - poor video skills.",1
96078,this course looks like for kids ... but this is not - we adults can learn way too many things too - totally recommended - very well conducted and informational - thanks!,5
96079,"This course is wonderful not only for violin teachers but also for students who are apt to self-study. The instructive videos are very concise, informative and well-organized. The musical examples are among the best for the demonstrated techniques.",5
96080,Super! Very valuable experience with Bootstrap!,5
96081,"Nice,i think bootstrap not too hard to understand.",4
96082,"Awesome Course , with a lot of details and great information also ... thanks to coursera they always bring to us a great value of knowledge",5
96083,It is a great course. Detailed information in this course about Bootstrap has helped me a lot.,5
96084,I found the material was good and the instructor was engaging. I appreciate that he tries to make learning hands on. Overall I found this a great introduction to Bootstrap. My only criticism is that at times I felt like I was only copying and pasting code rather than really learning the material. I ended up copying and pasting plenty of tags that are never really mentioned or explained.,4
96085,Very Good Experience,5
96086,"Good one to start with. Even though it is just basics, but a good foundation.",5
96087,This course is really good for anyone who has basic knowledge of any programming language. this will help you to connect dots on how web programming is done for companies and how tools are used to expedite your coding.,5
96088,Perfect.,5
96089,great course and the entire specialization is superb,5
96090,"this course in an excellent course , the instructors are well trained and excellent in programing. If i get children I will think a way of sending them to Hong kong to study this university",5
96091,"It was a really good course. Some negative comments say things about the instructor speaking slow or do not liking the way exercises are donde (following the video).The instructor is clearly a non-native english speaker so it is normal that he does not speak it the way most are used to, but you can set the reproduction rate to a higher one.Everything else was just perfect and I really learned a lot.",5
96092,I learned a lot in this course. The instructor was clear.,5
96093,Good Course,4
96094,Excellent course on Bootstrap and responsive web design. Concepts well explained with plenty of good examples. You will definitely learn Bootstrap once you finish this course.,5
96095,"great course, rich in vital information for new developers",5
96096,"This course is excellent, and comprehensive.",5
96097,Great course,5
96098,Awesome Course,5
96099,"A very good course that introduces important topics, tools and techniques",5
96100,The course is excellent.The professor is very clear and presents many concepts and resources usefuls.,5
96101,Great course! Really completeTo who is going to do it: Read the additional resources always! These are really useful,5
96102,"A lot of people says the course is boring because of the instructor but, for me he his doing well and i quite grab a lot from him things i didn't catch up before in previous Bootstrap course i took. his pace is perfectly ok and i had no problem with accent or something. I give him 5 stars",5
96103,Loved it,5
96104,Good Course Work!! Very Good Faculty!!,5
96105,Lecturer is too boring and volume is too low.,2
96106,The only problem on this journey with Jogesh sir is that it seems like I have got to know his quirkiness so well that he feels like someone I would love to know personally but can't! I enjoy the way he seems to simplify concepts and bring them together in the end to make even the most difficult concept seem entirely simple.,5
96107,"Great course, well designed, everything is great, but there's always a room for improvement. may be more excercises will help improve it",5
96108,"Really great! The materials, exercises and assignments. I would defiantly recommend someone to do this. One will have a great appreciation for bootstrap and the tools covered in this course.",5
96109,Very interesting.,5
96110,Excellent course for boot-strap,5
96111,So Userfull and funny course. it's very good if you want to leard front web UI developer.,4
96112,"This course was awesome! The mentor taught all the topics with such great ease and in the correct order. Not only the coding part was given value, its implications were also kept in mind. I would like to recommend this course to enhance your front-end skills. This course gives you whatever it has promised.Do check this course :)",5
96113,Excellent lecturer. Gained a deeper insight into Bootstrap.,5
96114,Great course!,5
96115,"Very good course to take, the instructor will walk step by step through the course. Although is one course but gives you lots of components needed to be a good front-end developer. Some people saying in their comments that the course or the instructor is boring,but I'm telling you from my experience this course is worth to take it and to be frank no course is easy or sweet no matter who teach just be patient and you will learn. Thanks",5
96116,The accent and rhythm of Jogesh makes it difficult to follow the course.There is no extra information in addition to the presentation. The teacher is only reading the slides which makes the experience quite limited/boring.The content is enough to get an idea of Bootstrap basic functionality.,1
96117,Great and smooth,5
96118,Excellent Course to learn Responsive web design,5
96119,Good course,5
96120,fantastic Course !,5
96121,"This course is a whoa!!! I recommend it for every new comer to bootstrap. I love the way the instructor (Jogesh K Muppala) took the course. Very simple to understand, well explained, very brief with nice practice exercise. Thanks for making the course available. I learnt a lot from it",5
96122,The lecturer's narration is a little embarrassing...,4
96123,great course with a lot of useful content. Bootstrap and Bower are very powerful tools!,5

96140,Great Course.,5
96141,A nice and complete course about front-end Frameworks.,5
96142,Nice course on Bootstrap. From an entry level to a fairly advanced in just four pretty intensive weeks.,5
96143,love it. the best ever,5
96144,It's great and full of useful information,5
96145,Good introduction of front-end web frameworks & tools.,5
96146,"Very Nice course. I have gained some confidence in Bootstrap now. I will like to Thank, Prof. Muppala for his hard effort for us students. Thank you Sir.",5
96147,comprehensively teaches the topics and impressed with it,5
96148,Really good course for those who want to learn more about Bootstrap and basic stuff about front-end technologies.,5
96149,it was a good course.but it was super boring as hellthat's why I didn't continue learning the other modulesmost of coursera's courses as boring but this was the most boring,3
96150,Very nice! Some things I felt that went too fast but in general it was great!,4
96151,"The assignment instructions weren't clear and when uploading the assignment files, the pages didn't render properly. This also was a problem during peer review of assignments.",3
96152,"Absolutely great course, I learned a lot.",5
96153,Very useful course! I learned a lot and can't wait to learn more from the next course! Thanks,5
96154,"Excellent course! It gave me an excellent introduction to a wide range of bootstrap components. I learned how to use bootstrap and its CSS clases and JavaScript components in my site, how to use bower to manage my project's dependencies, how to make some very basic functions using JQuery and how to use Less and Sass to preprocess my Stylesheets in a more handy way. I loved this course, because even when it seems to be very basic, i feel la I know a lot about this technologies i've learned. This is a must if you're new to bootstrap or some Web Development tools based on nodejs like Bower, Sass or Less",5
96155,A great course to learn about bootstrap if you are a beginner.,4
96156,Awesome course indeed. I bet these courses are more credible than the degree courses which we follow at most of the universities.,5
96157,Great course to understand responsive design and to take a nice and deep start up with bootstrap framework!,5
96158,Excellent course. The content is well organized. It has a short task after each module. It helps a lot to understand every part of the course. I highly recommend it!!!,5
96159,very good course. I add this comment when I review this course :),5
96160,"It's the very good course, the professor has a incridible form to explain.",5
96161,Needs more practical examples.Like project for free.,4
96162,Thanks for this opportunity!,5
96163,Good and Informative,5
96164,"I was able to learn Bootstrap effectively from this course. The assignments were good practise. However, reviewing other peoples assignments was a bit annoying, as their files had to be downloaded and put opened in a browser and it was a bit of as tedious process. The teaching style was good.",4
96165,"The assignment instructions and grading criteria are unclear/incomplete. Because of this, given these are peer graded assignments, it is likely to lose marks because the peers interpreted the instructions differently. Some of the topics covered in the lectures are not covered in the assignments, while other topics which are not covered are. All assignments build upon the code written in the exercises in all previous weeks, so there is no way to know if you are starting off with correct code. The lecture videos contain a lot of code examples, but the various key notions covered are not explained and the assumption seems to be you will look those up in the API. Sometimes the code examples in the slides contain mistakes. It sometimes felt like the content covered in the videos could have been delivered in a much shorter time.",2
96166,Very well delivered. I do believe however that the peer review may sometimes let certain details slip through and as a result the learning experience might be not as good as it could be.,4
96167,"Good, if basic, intro to frameworks and tools.",5
96168,It is an awsome course.,5
96169,Very very helpful course! The instructor speed slowly and I can listen the course clearly! Thank you!,5
96170,good instructions,4
96171,I feel like the Bootstrap content was very well presented. It was easy for me to understand and I had no major problems with assignments after watching all the materials and doing excersies along the way.,5
96172,"Easy, but learned a lot.",5
96173,A good course to getting used to how things work and being briefly exposed to the tools available.,4
96174,This is very good course about ui frameworks and tools,5
96175,"Good Teaching method! professor teaches very nicely!, Easy to learn!Thank you.Team: Couresera",5
96176,It is always fun learning in Coursera! Professor Muppala made it even more interesting.Thank you sir!I feel more hands on assignments to have a better understanding will be more exciting .,4
96177,"It was an excellent journey on Bootstrap. The instructor, Mr Jogesh was really helpful in taking us through the course giving a strong insight into the bootstrap world. This course has given me a confidence in building a responsive website UI ahead. Hoping to enhance the knowledge in the coming courses in the specialization and build a strong career as Web dev.Thank You, Sir!",4
96178,Good for to get knowledge in web tools.,5
96179,"It'a really good course, well explained.My only observation would be that it's really frustrating that you cannot submit your work, just because you didn't payed for the course.",4
96180,I loved the exercises and the way the process was centered on making the learner practice and take action!,5
96181,"two stars because I really suffered during this course .I didn't like the instructor behavior of explaining the topics he represents.First of all I didn't like the idea of building over one website, if you didn't get what was happening so you already ruined a part of the total website which you will continue building over during the whole coursesecond the assignments requirements requires additional searches which wasn't explained in details during the sessionthird the explanation is so boring and you can easily lose your concentration because of poor communication skillsforth the assignments requires two many details really, Also I need to get the code of other classmates using ""get source code "" option on my google chrome and then run it again , there are much efficient ways to handle that like running the delivered assignment directly on the server",2
96182,"It's always tricky to create a course on a framework, since it's always updating itself, but this is a solid base if you think you can't manage to learn everything on your own and need a place to start. After this you'll be familiar with the concept of UI frameworks and therefore will be easier to learn them in the future.",4
96183,Great course for learning and understanding Bootstrap.,4
96184,Great Course,5
96185,the instructor is really amazing :),5
96186,"Professor Muppala thank you, you really taught me a lot",4
96187,Great introduction to Bootstrap and LESS. Assignments are practical and build on each other.,5
96188,Nice approach!,5
96189,Great course!,5
96190,I don't like the teacher,1
96191,This course is good and simple with explanationand i prefer anyone to take it because it is useful,5
96192,I was a really good course. However some of the assignment tasks could have been a bit more complex (For example week 4).,4
96193,Excellent course with good challenging assignments. It improves our understanding in designing complex webpages in a smooth and easier way. Recommended for everyone who are wishing to grow as a web developer.,5
96194,In this course we can learn about the fundamentals of front-end web development and some useful tools.,5
96195,This course is a must for students / professional who are passionate about Web development. Provides a good understanding of skills that are required for one to succeed.,5
96196,awesome course with very good practice but explanation need to be more enthusiastic,4
96197,Simply awesome I really like the teacher.,5
96198,"Great course on bootstrap, after it you will have no problem creating a beautiful static webpage",5
96199,"Pretty decent breakdown of Bootstrap, but execution can be poor with the assignments. For example, one of the end-chapter assignments is missing complete instructions, and enough digging in the forums refers to, ""a screenshot of the complete instructions"". Rather unacceptable for a peer-reviewed course, okay for a free, self-auditing run.",3
96200,Great course..,5
96201,"Great course! For a beginner, it integrates basic concepts and wonderful practices, so that I got the knowledge and practical skills to build a beautiful and attractive web-pages. Also, it provides a broaden view of the techs in the web-development area. Thank you all the staff!",5
96202,it is super :),5
96203,All around great platform to learn on,5
96204,"very powerful, covered a lot of topics and explain it very well, i gained a lot of experience from it and i recommend it to any junior in web development track.",5
96205,Nice Explanation....,5
96206,"In the end of this course, I acquired strong basic knowledge for continue using bootstrap UI FW in real tasks. Explanation of lessons was informative, easy for understanding, and sufficiently deeply.",5
96207,Professionally handled course that is easy to understand and teaches you a lot!,5
96208,Great flow and spirits. I appreciate your crack at jokes :) keep up the great work prof!,5
96209,Awesome course !!A must for those interested in easy UI development of website using bootstrap.,5
96210,Excellent course! It was a very good experience. In recommend everyone this course in order to improve your skills.,5
96211,Very good introduction for bootstrap,5
96212,"I think this course was way too ambitious. It's neat to imagine learning all of this stuff in four weeks, but one should be realistic. Sure, we had lectures explaining things, but in the end we mostly had to copy-and-paste code and confirm that it worked. There should have been many, many more quizzes and short coding exercises to assess our understanding.Perhaps billing this with more content hours would be appropriate. To really understand and absorb this stuff, I'll need to spend a lot of time with the ""additional resources"". The lectures and scaffolded exercises certainly exposed us to a lot, but it would be hard to say I really learned very much.",3
96213,Very basic course. It's not worth it 70$,3
96214,Great course!,5
96215,I can't stress enough how much my view towards front end development changed after taking this course. And have never stopped using the tools that I learnt here.,5
96216,I reminds me what I did to my previous company. It is like a brush up and the instructor is good in delivering the content.,4
96217,"I learn so much, thank you very much.",5
96218,Very good info about using Bootstrap!,5
96219,Great way to get the basic knowledge about main tools,5
96220,I found excellent with Practical examples and assimilation As gradual Learning .,5
96221,Great course,5
96222,Good explanation. And good exercise. The exercise help me a lot to make a knowledge more clear.,5
96223,good course.,5
96224,"Thank you!Some of the exercises were not that well explained, but with the help of the forum everything was doable.",4
96225,Good course and assignments!,5
96226,Very good course and the professor is very nice!,5
96227,The course content was very informative and straight to the point.,5
96228,It's a great course. It covers everything in a very easy-to-understand manner. Also the mentors are great.,5
96229,The Best course to introduce anyone to boostrap with topics that most tutorials/lectures don't cover.,5
96230,Great course,5
96231,"wonderful course well structured learning material .Any one interested in web Development must do this course.Thank you ,Sir for teaching and providing us such a informative course .",5
96232,Very Good Course,5
96233,thanksi like the assignment really :),5
96234,Great course and also great teacher,5
96235,The sound doesn't turn up very loud.,3
96236,Great teacher and great course!,5
96237,A nice course. Just learning a lot.,5
96238,Good lecture for knowing Bootstrap!,4
96239,"Simply Perfect, Clear and fully understandable",5
96240,Comprehensive guide to bootstrap,5
96241,"Course content is good, however instructions for the assignments are not complete. Often, instructions for the assignments that are required in the grading criteria are buried in the discussion forums, sometimes in multiple threads. And the method of grading is also only explained in the discussion forum. This can lead to the peer review grades being difficult to assign. The assignment pages should be updated to properly include ALL requirements and an explanation of how to grade the assignment.",3
96242,Very nice course,5
96243,"Well done! I liked that the exercises provided less and less instruction but were definitely do-able with a little research, just like real life. Highly recommend!",5
96244,good course,5
96245,Really good course to learn Bootstrap!,5
96246,Thanks You,5
96247,"The course is good. It helps have clarity around Bootstrap elements, and covers basics on things like Less and Sass. At the end you will not be a super expert, but you will be able to understand how to build a basic webpage and how to use support elements like less, sass, and package management tools.",4
96248,"Fantastic course , well taught and explained with great examples.",4
96249,This is interesting,5
96250,Great and giving - i can now apply my newly achieved knowledge into my daily work.,5
96251,"It is amazing how we learn on Coursera courses. We have build a solid atarting point on Bootstrap framework, understanding the main classes. We are already able to build something real web design.",4
96252,A very interesting course and a good overview of Bootstrap. The teacher's style helps a lot to grab new concepts.,5
96253,Challenging and fun,5
96254,"I like most of them, but I think it is kind of too many contents",4
96255,Good professional advices. Much more than a simple tutorial.,5
96256,this course one of the most fantastic courses i take,5
96257,very clear and organized course,4
96258,great to understand basics of Bootstrap,4
96259,Very nice tutorial for starters. Includes all the necessary documentation needed and the exercises are very well planned such that they cover all the concepts. Highly engaging tutor. Strongly recommend!,5
96260,"I don't recommend this class. Jogesh K. Muppala has very labored English and his pace and verbosity make the lectures hard to get through. I've turned in around 10 assignments and have yet to get a grade on anything. The course content is poorly organized and executed. Peer grading is just dumb (and clearly doesn't work, since I have yet to get a single assignment back). When you turn in assignment files, they cannot be opened (and we found out from an apparent student how to get past the technical issues). Questions about the class and submitting assignments went unanswered. My advice, save your money and don't take this class.",1
96261,I loved this course. While this course will not make you an expert with Bootstrap it will however take you up to a level where you're able to learn on your own and actually understand why is something happening when it's happening.,5
96262,"Good course, i liked the exercises. It is well explained, but you also need to learn/read from other sites (what is linked as resource), to be able to do the weekly tasks. I liked this approach, the teacher is explaining the lectures well.",5
96263,Very nice method to teach the basics of bootstrap frameworks. I recommend this course!,5
96264,"Excellent for absolute beginners! But, if you have good experience in CSS & JavaScript you might play it at 1.5X, it is too informative to be attended by someone who knows even a little, it might be boring, then.Generally, the course is very informative, rich, instructions based and have very good exercises covering all the course content with a good-as-a-start hands on experience.",3
96265,"This course will be very help for me in my masters track. Since I am doing master in this field so I want to study all the topic in more detail. Furthermore, the course is helpful for me in my career development.",5
96266,"Great course , great teaching style and content :)Loved the course.",5
96267,Really good course on Bootstrap and Responsive design.,5
96268,"I think the course, while well laid out content-wise, is poorly executed. I'm thankful I audited the course. I would have been upset had I paid for it. Still, even the free access permits you to use all of the materials minus the major graded assignments. I struggled getting any styling to work with my CSS (files that was provided by the teacher) in conjunction with my Bootstrap. I was unable to replicate what he presented throughout the project (figuring it out on my own after-the-fact), as he would jump ahead in sections while verbally NOT visually detailing what he would be doing next. I was lost for a while. When I managed to correct where he'd left me in the dark, I found that my class assignments failed to override the bootstrap defaults. I didn't get much help when I asked if he had altered the bs files or changed his specificity in order to get them to work. Overall - I'd give the class a C+. I did learn a few things that filled in the gaps with responsive websites, but the tutorials were ultimately not very helpful.",2
96269,Brilliant bootstrap. Strap on your boots and be prepared for a journey into the inner workings of Bootstrap (shamelessly 'borrowed' this pun from the course).,5
96270,"Found all the lessons very well explained. The exercises were clear and helped a lot to put all in action.The shared PDF's are a good guide. About the videos It seems to me a challenge to put many concepts in short ones, less than 10min of duration.I am very satisfied, even some videos could be considered too long. ;-)",5
96271,Maybe the best first contact with bootstrap for any web developer,5
96272,"Great course for beginners in Bootstrap, like myself.",5
96273,Learned a lot!,5
96274,Very well explained! Details hand on exercises that help a lot understanding the subjects,5
96275,Great!,5
96276,It is very good course and very much useful for us.,5
96277,"nice course, nice way of teaching by giving the assigments after the practice on exercises.",5
96278,Very Good Course for begineers,5
96279,Amazing course with great knowledge of UI Frameworks and its components.,5
96280,Good teaching method,5
96281,The course offers good material and covers the minimum requirements of bootstrap. The additional resources provided by the instructor are great for futher reading. The problem is the instructor delivers the material in an organized way but he is very slow.,4
96282,"The course proposal is very good, but the material and the examples need to be improved.",4
96283,"As a beginner, this cours is greate",3
96284,"I really liked that, I never coded anything with Bootstrap and it was awesome. Now I'm prepared and ready to go ahead with Angular Course.",5
96285,The instructor is great and super funny.,5
96286,Very well explained !!,5
96287,This course is really useful for beginners like me. But. sometimes i feel like fast forwarding the course. It was too slow in the middle.,4
96288,Good basic course,3
96289,The student is carefully led into the vast language of Front-End coding with easy-to-follow videos and exercise instructions.,5
96290,Love it so far. The lesson exercises make everything easy to learn and not boring.,5
96291,Very useful course. Professor explained material in a nice and interesting way.,5
96292,"I think the classes and the exercises could be far more dynamic and didactic, but besides of that is a good course to get a grip of Bootstrap if you follow along writing the code and if you tinker a little by yourself afterwards. But it's definitely for people with solid JS and CSS bases.",3
96293,"It is too hard to understand what he is saying, his accent is impossible to follow. Besides, the lectures are not dynamic, it is just him reading the slides with the most monotonous and boring voice ever. I took the first course of the specialization with David and this is the complete opposite. I would love to see the whole 5 courses with David and not only the first one.",1
96294,I can beat my chest and say I know bootstrap it was an awesome experience... I was taught well which is a whole lot better than self learning/teaching which leaves a you with a whole lot of unknown information about the subject.,5
96295,"Straight to the point, very explanatory ....Made learning easy and fun.",5
96296,"My frst Certificated Courera Course.I took about 12 hours to finish it.I think this Course is a 5-star-course, and maybe the best Bootstrap MOOC course on Internet;The curriculum is set reasonably,I believe with this course finished ,you will have a solid grasp of bootstrap,and know how to build enterprise Web UI.what's more,the Professor is very kind and with a sense of humor.",5
96297,Great Bootstrap usage and explanation of classes in the framework.,5
96298,i'm really glad i took this course most especially when it comes to bower et al. Really really glad for the opportunity. thank you,4
96299,Thank you for this course. I learned so much on this course. It has encouraged to not give up on this new career of web development I have started,5
96300,Great course for people who start creating web application. Great exercises and assignments. Thank you very much.,5
96301,"Wonderful course, well designed content, exercise and assignment. Only that difficulties of the assignment could be improved so as to ensure bette learning. We want more challenge! lol",5
96302,"good course with clear explanation, thank you",5
96303,It's a good course where I come across bower and CSS how to use the function for the UI frameworks.,3
96304,"I have learned many thing by attending the class, which is good for helping me find a job.",5
96305,Easy way to understand and assignments covers the most important parts in every week .,5
96306,"Clear explanations,exercises are very detailed and contain sufficient complexity to make them useful.",5
96307,Extremely practical! Thank you,5
96308,Excellent!!! Learning so much! Recommend to beginners!,5
96309,really good,5
96310,"this is a good course to get started on front-end web frameworks , and the teaching was very good .",5
96311,"nice course and good instructor. but talks too slow, I completed whole course at audio speed x1.5.",4
96312,Well designed and informative!,5
96313,"For all the many courses I took on Coursera, this course is one of the best.",5
96314,"Before , I have heard alot about Bootstrap in jobs requirements , from my class mates and so on ... I don't know why I didn't have enough courage to start learning Bootstrap by myself .... after completing this course .. I can consider myself good at using the power of Bootstrap ... this course gives me a strong push towards enrolling Web world and diving deeper and learning more ... thanks Coursera thanks Honk Kong University thanks Dr. Jogesh K. Muppala",5
96315,"I would like to express my gratitude to prof. Muppala for this incredible course.There are indeed many great resources for learning any of the technologies and tools used in this course and specialization. But what is unique about this specialization, is that it gives us not only solid foundations needed to use these tools, but, just as importantly, a clear context as to where a certain tool or its segment is used. Sure enough, having in mind the broader context, it is much easier to understand all of the segments individually.I would also like to thank Krešimir and all the other mentors that helped make this course a pleasant experience.I can't wait for the next course on Angular JS to start!",5
96316,This course can be a bit dry at times. But still very informative,4
96317,awesome course...,4
96318,Good course with great teacher,5
96319,Great intro to bootstrap. I feel like more bootstrap features and web tools could have been covered.,4
96320,Good class. Lots of fun.,5
96321,"老师讲的很好，就是有些拖沓。实验部分希望老师在最后可以给出源码。A good course, good teacher, except that sometimes the teacher is kind of slow. And I do really hope that teacher could give us the final codes right after every exercise.",4
96322,One of the best on coursera.. tons of praise for the professor.,5
96323,"This class teaches you the essentials of Bootstrap v3. It is by no means a complete course on Bootstrap, but it will teach you how to use the main components effectively.",4
96324,"The full course should be available to everybody with the assignments, only the certificate should be given to those who have paid for the course.",4
96325,"If you're expecting a decent tutorial on Bootstrap, this is the course for you. If you're expecting a course on fundamental UI design and implementation concepts, you might be a little disappointed. Overall, well presented with a fun restaurant mock web site as the final project.",4
96326,"Excellent course. Well taught by Prof. Muppala. Instructor has covered all key points of Bootstrap. Towards the end, he is appropriately introduced node.js and bower.His restaurant example is very appropriate for the course contents and builds continuity through out the course.",5
96327,Last assignment does not have full instructions on how to complete it. Otherwise a good course.,4
96328,Really nice,5
96329,best tutorial for bootstrap.,5
96330,I enjoyed the course. Not a difficult course but the course experience was great. Instructor was also really good at explaining concepts.,5
96331,helps to know every section of bootstrap,5
96332,Well structured and informative.,5
96333,Now for me bootstrap is more clear.,4
96334,"Very interesting, actual material and good teacher.",5
96335,Perfect Bootstrap learning course.,5
96336,Great Courses!,5
96337,very good ! This course help me a lot. Really appreciate !,5
96338,Great!,5
96339,"Valuable and very well organized, I found it quite simple",3
96340,This course is great if you are looking for learning responsive web designing using Twitter Bootstrap. Lot of areas are covered in this single course along.,5
96341,Thank you!,5
96342,"I enjoyed this course and felt it to be a good introduction to Bootstrap.The time allocations were not realistic, though. I have a fairly strong (albeit outdated) background in programming and web design, but I still felt that I spent a lot more more time than what was allocated for learning. I imagine that this can be very discouraging to beginners.I am looking forward to the remaining modules.",4
96343,Very useful course,5
96344,"Enjoyed the course!I learned bootstrap before from codeschool, but it wasn't as good as this course!",5
96345,"The topic is overall well covered.The material are not easy to go through and do not reference well key knowledge area, specifically: how to apply them.The exercises and the assignments could be largely improved: the targets and the guidance are not always clear. Adding up on the same files instead having one file per exercice / one learning key point does not help.",3
96346,Great and easy step by step bootstrap course,5
96347,"I would recommend reading the docs on the bootstraps website, this course doesn't add much value to just the normal bootstrap docs",2
96348,"This bootstrap course is very nice , every components are explained nicely. Assignments also good. Waiting for next angular js lecture",4
96349,Great course. So detailed and has so many practical tasks. Definitely recommend!,5
96350,Good Course,5
96351,It is a very useful course,5
96352,Well Organized and very instructive. Thanks.,5
96353,"helping me lot, thanks",5
96354,"I really enjoyed the course, it was taught well and i had fun learning about bootstrap.",5
96355,Very good course for programmers new to this area.Course is prepared very well.It was very useful for me. Thanks,5
96356,Nice course.Recommend this one as an introduction into Bootstrap/Angular,5
96357,Cool,5
96358,Excellent course. Every week the professor made an incredible effort to make it easy. I highly recommend it.,5
96359,Interesting topic for easy website building,5
96360,Very well organized and linked.,5
96361,Nice class,4
96362,Excelent course. The teacher is amazing and the course content is great!!!,5
96363,Nice lecture and good for starter to learn,5
96364,"Such a good tutorial for beginner,Thank you so much for this.",5
96365,This course gave me the fundamentals to start with the development of responsive web sites. The learning process is well supported with some exercises for each reviewed topic.,4
96366,"I audited this course and did the assignments independently.This course focuses on examining Bootstrap's CSS and Javascript components in much detail. Towards the end one is introduced to NPM and Bower.Concepts are explained through a project. Nearly all major components of Bootstrap were covered, many of which are often ignored in other courses I have taken. The course materials (the slides) are very well made. I like the pace at which this course goes and the instructors are very active and helpful on the discussion forums.",5
96367,This was a four star course and the links to additional information were a good resource. 3 stars for the discussions which were left unanswered much of the time and not a highly active mentor group. Much was left to student when stuck and exasperated options.,3
96368,Thorough introduction into Bootstrap. I especially liked the hands-on exercises!,5
96369,Nice and clear.,5
96370,"Good course. The assignments are a bit too easy since they give the code in the assignment details basically, but still the course gives a good introduction to bootstrap and other web frameworks and tools.",5
96371,Explanation from scratch! Just Brilliant!,5
96372,"Excellent instructor. Good content, and very good explanations. Very good additional resources.",5
96373,Good informative course for starters on bootstrap.,5
96374,"Good Course ,Good content for Bootstrap.",5
96375,Exceptional Tutorial... This is really a nice tutorial. Well presented and explained. Practical activity is too good. Thanks,5
96376,This course was an excellent introduction into Bootstrap. It was very useful to me. The instructor was very knowledgeable and presented the subject in a very intuitive and logic manner.,5
96377,Awesome Course (y)Must for all beginners!!!!,5
96378,watching the videos with speed 1.5 is optimal,5
96379,Great information and structure to this course. Easy to follow along and understand the concepts. I would not be able to do the same thing just by surfing the net.,5
96380,It is easy to start coding using the Bootstrap. This course provides most useful components of Bootstrap library and uses a real project to apply css and js libraries.,5
96381,"A large portion of the course is just copy and pasting code that is provided to you. While the code that is pasted is explained, and a lot of content is covered as a result of not having to write it, I feel my overall retention is much lower than in other courses.",2
96382,Overall a good course,4
96383,The course is good. Gives a brief overview of Javascript.,5
96384,"The course is good. I already use Bootstrap and still finding useful information here. But the sound is too silent. Also teacher speaks too slow, it makes listening even more difficult.",3
96385,Joggesh is a great instructor. He is very thorough in his lectures and his presentations.,5
96386,Thanks for this course it is very useful.,4
96387,As Interesting as funny & useful,5
96388,Its been an interesting course,4
96389,Great Course!!,5
96390,Nice materials and trainers. Very useful,5
96391,"Enjoyed course. Wish the review questions didn't include 'ands ' (both had to be right for a 'Yes' and pts) . With many ways to solve problems, these 2-part questions didn't always fit. Sometimes a peer had one exactly and then did the other part a different way that worked just fine. They make it harder to grade people. In most cases, if it worked I said it was good-to-go.",4
96392,Great,5
96393,This course was very informative and assignments were very good.trainer was clear and good.,5
96394,strongly recommend!,5
96395,"A informative class with a great instructor. Teaching is mostly through videos but their are exercises each day as well, which I appreciate (I'm a hands on kind of learner). The assignments at the end of the week are challenging in that they usually ask you to learn something from a 3rd part website or take what you know and combine it in ways he hasn't shown you. While that might be difficult for some I find it refreshing. By the end I feel that I know the breadth of bootstrap and have decent skills to implement basic websites with it.",4
96396,"I'm enjoying this course. Material and themes covered by professor are very useful to anybody involved in web development.Maybe, I will try to improve the way we review peer's work.",4
96397,Very well planned course.,4
96398,Thank you for the excellent training.,5
96399,I learned bootstrap from this course for the first time and now i'm a full time web developer and i'm still using the course videos to get my hand on some components of bootstraps.,5
96400,love this lesson!i can understand everything and i learned so many useful things!,5
96401,"A very good course, working on one large website project. The lecturer talks a little slowly, but makes things very clear. Some of the review criteria for the assignments are wrong for example ""div-xs-12"" should have been ""col-sm-12"" , which makes fair grading difficult at times.",4
96402,"Well, I've learnt a lot of things, thank you so much!!!",5
96403,"This course is a hit. Bootstrap is easy to use, has so many facets and applications and therefore, it's vital to understand it. Because if you understand Bootstrap, you understand HTML, CSS and at least the concept of JavaScript.Professor Jogesh manages to get all this across in a way that is focussed on a project at hand, but allows the mind to construct a complete reference and understanding for the framework as well as its underlying technologies. It is quite the feat, both as a technology and as a course.",5
96404,good course,5
96405,"great course, great instructor",5
96406,"Great Bootstrap course, sadly it's mandatory to pay to get a feedback with the projects",4
96407,"-I like the teacher a lot. He speaks understandable, at the right speed and he explains well in my opinion.-The slides contain just the right information. I like the practical approach especially.-Assigment was a bit easy, but still covered the essentials.",5
96408,"This is a well-organized course, easy to understand. The knowledge is very practical and useful to front-end web development.",5
96409,"i think the assignment of this course was very good and i think any one that did the assignment by himself ,have learned some good web dev skills .",5
96410,very nice course to enable me follow up the latest web development technology applied in industry.,5
96411,Well defined and covered topics.,4
96412,Very good video lectures,5
96413,It's excellent especially the pop ups during video,5
96414,Great Course!,5
96415,Would have like it more if JQUERY section was covered in more depth covering more examples and features.,3
96416,good intro to bootstrap,4
96417,"Good course, but a little expensive to participate. it's terrible that i cannot submit the assignment.",4
96418,"First, the assignments always had poor instructions. It wasn't until grading time you would find out what the criteria are. (After your assignment is submitted)Secondly, there was no documentation/help for the fact the Windows needs a webserver to run content in this section. (Many versions of Windows can't do this) Discovered/resolved over many hours, when course content would not work.The actual course content was sparse/not much to it other than ""Bootstrap bootstrap bootstrap."" After how good the first course was/how much ground it covered, this course was frustrating, poorly documented, and a disappointment.",1
96419,This course content is very good! but i got stuck sometimes because some program installation is very annoying(ex... bower...).,4
96420,Good course,5
96421,The teacher is very good! He explains very well and the material is very carefully prepared. Great Course!,5
96422,Really nice content. Great teacher,5
96423,"Difficult to understand, not a good explainer.",1
96424,Great introduction to Bootstrap and responsive design.,5
96425,"The lecture is well organized, slides are very clear and easy to follow. After each class, there is a clear instruction on exercises available both in PDF format and video format, which is very helpful for beginner like me.",5
96426,"That was a great introduction to Bootstrap 3. And a big plus for introducing bower and npm. However, it is still recommended to code a serious webpage yourself after finishing this course to solidify the elusive knowledge.",5
96427,Very helpful course to get hands on using Bootstrap framework and in order to learn the responsive approach of modern web development.This course provides a good insight on front-end development. I also discovered a very nice editor called Brackets (recommended in the lessons) and used it to test the examples on my computer. Brackets has a great feature for live preview in the Chrome browser.The material has a very good structure and detail level. I want to thank to Jogesh Muppala for teaching this course.,5
96428,Very nicely created course. Enjoying it :),5
96429,Good course!,5
96430,"Well presented course, with carefully thought out exercises and assignments that all worked together to reinforce the material. The videos explaining the assignments helped to clarify the requirements, and Jogesh Muppala's sense of humour makes the lectures a pleasure to watch.",5

96432,thank you,5
96433,Very good course. Thank you HKUST!,5
96434,Excellent course which give a detail concept of web Programming.,5
96435,A very good course. If you want to learn about Front-End Web UI Frameworks and Tools then this is the best source for you. The instructor is so awesome and his teaching methods are very comprehensive.,5
96436,Prof. Jogesh rocks!,5
96437,"A lot of necessaty informaton, good explonations.",5
96438,"Dr. Jogesh Muppala is a great teacher, I've never missed the way throught the course so far. Also he sometimes makes funny jokes.",5
96439,the course was awesome,5
96440,Awful teacher,2
96441,This course was a good introduction at Bootstrap and front end development. It was a pleasure to listen to the lecturer.,5
96442,Material as well as trainer is excellent. Perfect course for beginners.,5
96443,very practical,5
96444,Very good course. It explores most of the Bootstrap components. It gives you more that enough information to start building a nice responsive website. Many thanks to the professor and his colleagues!,5
96445,Really helps you to under the front-end web development,5
96446,"jogesh mupalla should be more descriptive about his explanation, he should explain if not all then most of the components of the bootstrap coding , which he sometimes skips or misses, otherwise the course is good",3
96447,"So many powerpoint slides.. It's very boring course. The tutor just read slides without deep explanations, wikipedia much more interesting. It's just observing course, theoretical 95%.",1
96448,Great,5
96449,"This course is excellent. I like the ""learn by doing"" method adopted and during the course you built a good website. The last part dedicated to node.js, bower and npm is very helpful to understand how to use these web tools.",5
96450,Really happy to getting know how bootstrap works. I have heard a lot about it but till this Course it was only magic for me.,5
96451,"Good content, and covered a lot in a short span of time",4
96452,"The course is very nice and informative. However, in comparison to the first course, where everything was explained to you in smallest detail, here you have to think much more on your own.",5
96453,Very good. Thank you,5
96454,"Excellent course, get you working with Bootstrap very quickly and efficiently.",5
96455,I really grateful to the Coursera as well as The Hong-Kong University of Science and Technology for providing such an opportunity to learn great technologies.I am also thankful to Professor Jogesh Muppala for guiding us throughout the course. :),5
96456,"+++ PROs First ++++ Pretty in-depth discussion of bootstrap+ You may watch the videos at 1.75x or 2x speed; you would enjoy the course a lot more+ You learn a lot towards the end of the course+ Homeworks were pretty good--- CONs ----- The bootstrap lessons are pretty much copy pasting code-- Week 4: Web Tools could be a little bit longer with even more examples about grunt, and Yo (we didn't see any example use cases on those topics)",4
96457,Good lecture and assignment. Let me learn a lot of things.,5
96458,"At times the homework requirements are not well-detailed, comparing to the grading instructions.",4
96459,like this course,5
96460,the teacher is excellent,5
96461,Great course,5
96462,tough but useful,5
96463,Great course,5
96464,I love the course and thanks Coursera to give me the chance to attend the course for free.,4
96465,Excelente thank you,4
96466,"I concur with others of a similar opinion on this course:Assignment instructions/criteria differ from the grading rubric criteria. Assignments mostly copy and paste. Referring people to the Bootstrap docs as reference defeats the purpose of an instructor. Many of the assignments required you to do things against best practices, like inserting inline styles to make your element look like the instructor's screenshot of his page.The last week's content seemed to be a slapdash mix of bits and pieces, and trying to inform people about Node modules via solving a quadratic equation seemed really strange. How about an example from the real world, like even an e-commerce application? (In the comments on this, the instructor said there wasn't time in this course to explain Node modules, but that he provided a ""clearer"" example in the Node.js course. Hunh? Why wouldn't you do a simpler example in the drive-by assignment?)Instructor consistently mispronounced words that are CENTRAL to the field, which just seemed weird and made me question his credibility. This might sound petty, but kuh-rooze-zel for the word Carousel? It would be like a fashion designer mis pronouncing tulle as tull-ee or bias as bye-ez.Just not impressed. I am glad my employer paid the tuition and not me. The only positive was it enforced a schedule and structure for me to try my hand at Bootstrap. I had already worked with Foundation.",2
96467,Great course! Easy to understand for a beginner and the exercises/assignments gives you hands-on experience. Highly recommended!,5
96468,Nice course with good explanation.,5
96469,Course content is good and it is well structured. Instructor is also quite knowledge and explains the concepts well.Definitely recommended.,5
96470,great course,4
96471,I was expecting the assignments to be harder. But overall a really good introduction to Bootstrap.,5
96472,"The tutor is doing great describing everything in a short, tight format. I had a great time understanding Bootstrap.It would be great if we had more exercises. A separate project, mirroring the one from the lectures and exercises.",5
96473,Perfect course,5
96474,Excellent course and teacher,5
96475,Great course! Easy to understand for a beginner and gives all necessary info for building a website.,5
96476,The best course I've seen!I can't describe how many new things I've learn during this course and how helpful it became for me!,5
96477,Very good course. Enjoy it a lot. Thank you Professor Jogesh.,5
96478,excellent course and the Teacher is the best.,5
96479,"Fairly disappointing compared to the first week of this course. The balance of instruction to exercise was very low. I also resent being sent to raw Bootstrap documentation; if I could have read that, I likely wouldn't be taking the course. It makes it frustrating to jump into the exercises when the course had 5-7 minutes of lectures, 15 minutes on the exercise and then an assignment on something new.Update: I'm also impressed by Mr. Muppala taking feedback like a boss and blaming students for low reviews.",2
96480,Really good course. Well structured and with a great teacher. It is really worth it.,5
96481,"Nice courses, covering the fundamental knowledge for Bootstrap",5
96482,Great Course !!,5
96483,Well organized course.,5
96484,Really useful. Thanks for everything.,5
96485,Good Professor. Very knowledgeable,5
96486,The best way to understand Bootstrap was to do a hands-on project. Professor Jogesh Muppala has done an amazing work explaining it with the project work.,5
96487,Very good and interesting. I had great fun!,5
96488,"Very nice course, was very easy to learn from!",5
96489,Really the best!!! But It will be good if lecture includes some errors we can make and silly mistakes which affects results adversely. Jogesh sir is very good teacher and he is clear and brief in less time,5
96490,I'm feeling great doing this specialization. Thank you by the valuable content.,5
96491,Top,5
96492,Excelent course to learn about bootstrap and fundamental CSS and Javascript.I recommend foolowing this course and his teacher.,5
96493,"Good Overview of Bootstrap, its usage and frameworks.",5
96494,Great course for learning bootstrap and other tools! Congratulations.,5
96495,It was a nice time to do all these exercises and watch videos with all steps to complete the task,5
96496,Good but the assignments are minor changes instead of full blown impls,4
96497,Great course !,5
96498,"This course took me from barely understanding html5 and js to being able to create (with help) navbars, drop-downs, breadcrumbs, carousel, modals, thumbnail inserts, and a lot more. I also learned to use Brackets, a very helpful code editor. Instruction was thoroughly organized, and I never, ever found a syntax error in the code Prof. Muppala provided. I am looking forward to the next course in this full-stack series.",5
96499,It nice to be building on one examples and see different ways to do it.,5
96500,Excellent course and instructor. I just wish the Angular course had an option to do the exercises without purchasing the course.,5
96501,Great course,5
96502,it was a nice course and i enjoyed with the learning .,5
96503,"Course is great, but I putted 4 stars because of missing hints for assignments. It will be great to have such hints in this course.",4
96504,Good course! It will be much better if the slides can be packaged in a zip file for the learners to download.,5
96505,Nice and helpful course,5
96506,Great way to get started with Bootstrap's functionality and gives you a way to go past the short but important course content and figuring things out by yourself.,5
96507,"Finally I understood, how the bootstrap works! Thanks a lot!",5
96508,"Very rigorous, hands-on and enriching course.All the courses from HKUST has all been superb so far.However I hope that there are machine grader to test our code instead of having only peer review",5
96509,"nice class, learnt a lot",4
96510,Wonderful course and instructor!!,5
96511,great course,4
96512,"I really liked the course, and the way grading is design compared to other courses, even thought we should be able to take only some points off, many times it's partially well and would deserve only 1 or 2 points to be deducted, and we have to deduct all or none. thanks",5
96513,Great course! I recommend it!,5
96514,The best course !,5
96515,awsome guide covering various tools and methods for developing a modern website.,5

96523,"Awesome Course. One of the best courses ,i have been part of on coursera.well paced, very rich in content, very good delivery of the ideas,.Assignments very good. A value for timei just wish practice quiz to have more number of question, and more challenging.A VERY SPECIAL THANKS TO JOGESH. THANKS A LOT",4

96529,very good course and awesome teacher,5
96530,like this course very much. you will learn a lot,4
96531,"Great class, the professor has a rather interesting sense of humor which actually makes the whole experience more enjoyable. The assignments are challenging enough to make sure you learn, but are still doable within the allotted time. One recommendation from me is to use the same tools he uses in the videos (such as Brackets) as it becomes a bonus to get familiar with new development tools.",5
96532,cool,5
96533,One of my favorite courses! Very fruitful and interesting since it helps students to build a decent base in bootstrap. Highly recommended course.,5
96534,Anybody who wants to develop a basic understanding of bootstrap or node.js should take this course.,4

96540,Like the instructor a lot and how the course has been designed.,5
96541,"Great course, expand my knowledge and skills about bootstrap. Great excercise help me to understand the concept of bootstrap very well. Very recomended for who want to be a great website developer.",5
96542,"This course was really helpful , it will teach you lot of things in no time .",5
96543,Expertly structured Course. Great learning experience.,5
96544,I like how every week there is an exercise that makes all the difference when it comes to understanding concepts that have been taught,5
96545,could be better,3
96546,Excellent course for intermediates!!,5
96547,I love the way the professor try to explain the concepts. I really did enjoy learning this course. I would definitely recommend this course!,5
96548,"Excellent introduction to Bootstrap framework. The professor does a great job explaining the main features of Bootstrap and what you need to do to get started. Also introduces other web development tools such as node.js, npm, bower, less/sass CSS preprocessors, etc..",5
96549,"I wanted a structured introduction to the topics in this course and that is exactly what it gave me. The instruction is clear, precise and well delivered. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to get started with web front end development.",5
96550,Very good course :),5
96551,Fantastic course! Really comprehensive yet easy and pleasant to follow.Just a minor comment - I'd like that review criteria were more specific beforehand - I actually had lower grades in a couple of assignments due to review items that only showed up after submission.,5
96552,Great class and awesome teacher. Keep it up.. !,5
96553,I really liked this course and I tought it was well constructed!,5
96554,poor teacher..,1
96555,I really enjoy the classes in this specialisation. A lot of detail is covered in an easy to follow set of lectures. Of the MOOC classes I have taken these have been my favourite,5
96556,"This is a great course for anyone looking to take their knowledge of basic web design to a new level. I found bootstrap a little intimidating at first but this course does a great job of teaching and explaining it at a great pace. If you're new to web development and tired of making websites that look like they're from the 90s, bootstrap is a great tool to get your websites to look modern and professional. The instructor is very knowledgeable and explains things thoroughly (he's also very funny!). I recommend incorporating the additional learning materials as they will help you understand the concepts discussed in the lectures on a much deeper level. Lastly, be sure to do every exercise as they are essential to completing the assignments. Have fun!",5
96557,Great professor and good explanations with a bit of a challenge with the assignments which made you have to make sure you understand the material.,5
96558,Awesome Course.. The way of teaching is very nice.. After taking this course now I am able to make responsive design using bootstrap.,5
96559,"Good course for learning Bootstrap, delivered well by the instructor.",5
96560,Good Course,5
96561,Nice course. Gave all the necessary insights about how UI of modern day professional web sites is made.,5
96562,"a great course to learn bootstrap, jquery, less, sass and web tools like bower",5
96563,Great course for beginners!,5
96564,Very good course and very helpful.,5
96565,"The course is pretty well structured and the exercises were explained pretty well. It was pretty easy to follow the steps and do the assignments, but sometimes required a little bit more explanation on what does what, and why sometimes even after following his steps, our website might not look similar to what he has done on the exercise. One thing also if possible I'm not sure if carousel is pronounced ka-ruu-sel in Hong Kong, but it's Char-uh-sel like the ride, which to me was quite annoying to listen to.",4
96566,Good course to take to advance bootstrap framework knowledge.,5
96567,A very good course. The best what I have seen in this area. I would make only some minor changes but I didn't watch the first course so there might be some complementary information what I don't know or wanted this course to have. The first 3 weeks is nice package for learning Bootstrap.,4
96568,Good Course for bootstrap introduction,4
96569,"I found this course an excellent expansion to what I already know about HTML, CSS and JS. There were points where I was frustrated and confused, but the material is presented clearly and enough reference links were provided that I wasn't frustrated or confused very long. I appreciated the instructor's sense of humor and the presentation of the material. I recommend it if you need Bootstrap familiarity and associated knowledge.",5
96570,Professor Muppala is an excellent teacher.,5
96571,the course is very good... perfect explanations and challenging assignments,5
96572,Great lectures to take put you right on track!,5
96573,Awesome course!!! very satisfied!!,5
96574,It gives you a lot of information about Bootstrap and various tool you can use for Front-End Web Development. It gives you hand on experience with Bootstrap and how it functions. It doesn't explain to you everything which can be a good thing or bad thing depending on how you see it. Overall it's a great course that makes you see how Web UIs are made.,4
96575,"This course was pretty cool. A lot of very useful stuff was covered, but I feel like it went too fast.But I think it could be better connected together in terms of broad principles, rather than just going through tons of particular examples. I still don't feel like I have a ""mental framework"" for how to lay out a web page, other than the basics of the 12-column grid system. It all seemed very ad hoc.It's by no means a bad course, and I still gave it four stars since the material is very useful, but I definitely think it could be improved upon.Also, the ratio of homework/lectures is way too low. I definitely think the course should put more emphasis on actually creating websites oneself. Many of the homework assignments took me under an hour -- after I spent hours watching all the videos and taking notes trying to remember it all.",4
96576,Super useful and practical!,5
96577,"I like the way of explanation, and good to know some more interesting things in bootstrap",5
96578,"I so much enjoyed learning with Mr.Muppala. I love his style, course structure, clarification. Made me really enjoy web development. Thank you :)",5

96585,great course! Really up to date. :),5
96586,"Excellent tutor, excellent contents in notes. In one word ""Outstanding""",5
96587,"Very generous and clearly delivered content. Most Coursera courses only manage to scratch the surface due to time and attention span restrictions, but this one really tries to provide a complete overview of the many possibilities that you can explore later by yourself.",5
96588,Excellent teacher and course format / materials. Teacher also makes a big effort to answer questions in the forum also.,5
96589,"Easy to learn, great contents",5
96590,Great course for beginners.,5
96591,This course contains almost every aspect of bootstrap and is a great course for anyone to get started with frontend frameworks. The teacher Jogesh sir has a very good way of teaching. Happy feeling after studying this.,5
96592,It‘s very difficult to listen what the teacher say. The teacher is not good for expression.感觉老师表达能力有所欠缺，听起来很吃力，说话语速很不流畅，应该要好好改进一下。真想退款了,3
96593,"Solid course, very hands-on, accomplishes its goals.",4
96594,"The lecturer is clear, but there is a problem with the paste.It is much too slow. He states the obvious too often, talks VERY slowly, and that makes it hard to stay focused.",2
96595,"Thank you professor Jogesh K Muppala.This is one of the best courses in the UI domain and any one interested must attend.The best part was the hands on teaching methodology and added to this the spice up was ""What mistake I made"" - learn and correct by validating other participants work... I enjoyed it..... :)Apologies for always been the late latif in submissions...",5
96596,Good walkthru of the basics of bootstrap (and more),4
96597,"excellent course, great instructor and material",5

96601,This instructor is awesome. Would love to see more material from him.,5
96602,"Even if I have worked with Bootstrap before, I found this course very useful to review and deepen my skills. The lessons and exercises are very clearly explained. The course is easy to follow and very enjoyable. I took this course as part of the Full Stack Web Development Specialization.",5
96603,Excellent teaching! Learning made easy in baby steps... very useful for beginners with little experience in web developing. Recommended!!,4
96604,"This course is very good. I took me from zero Bootstrap to a very competent level. I was even able to make a side website project that I now use at work. There are minor things that are not explained, but extra material is provided, so no problem.",4
96605,Great course and great staff,5
96606,Nice overview of bootstrap and why css frameworks are used. Time well spent!,4
96607,It's a good introduction to understand how Bootstrap works.,5

96614,"This is a good course. Even though the exercises are not graded, they are important.",5
96615,Brilliant coursework :),5

96617,Very interesting and comprehensive course,5
96618,great introduction,5
96619,Very detailed and informative course with lots of hands-on exercises.,5
96620,"This course was very well-designed and prepared. The professor has a great way to present the material in a thorough, methodic manner. Lots of attention is given to practical exercises which are easy to follow and greatly help in digesting large amounts of material that the professor presents.",5
96621,Pedagogical and to the point.,5
96622,Amazing Course to get a hang of how modern web pages are made,5
96623,This instructor is excellent! He makes it very easy to follow along. I've learned much!,5
96624,Excellent course that slowly builds up a web site with exercises and assignments. Instructor has good sense of humor which makes the lectures interesting and fun.,5
96625,A great course. I recommend it,4
96626,First course by David Rossiter set the bar very high. This is like going through a manual or series of instructions. Would like 2 courses to be taken by David and 2 by Jogesh...Else the style becomes very monotonous. The course by David was awesome. This is not as good,1
96627,very good course.Thanks,5
96628,Breaks page in end.. Some of Bootstrap components were only described do this and this instead WHAT are the parts and options and WHY do we do this and that.,4
96629,Its really awesome.,5
96630,"Great intro course that fully dives into Bootstrap and all it's capabilities. The site that you build in this course can actually be a decent addition to any portfolio for a new web designer too.I would have given it a 5/5, but I thought the course moved too slowly and rushed over explaining the available JavaScript and jQuery plugins that Bootstrap has to offer. The plugins are quite useful not just within Bootstrap, and they can be installed and customized for a range of web projects.Expect to dedicate at least 3-4 hours a week just completing the module lectures and exercises along with the homework assignment. This is not out of the ordinary though, Bootstrap does have a lot of components to cover. I truly believe Professor Muppala is the best person to do it as well. I appreciated his input in the discussion forums and thorough instruction.",4
96631,"4rd assignment is tooooo easy - i expect here complicated task with non-trivial work with modules but not this child's plays.Other assignments and lectures looks good, but here is too many errors in subtitles - not critical but in every video i detect at least 1-2",4
96632,Great instructor!,5
96633,Coursera is the best!!,5
96634,"If you want to understand Bootstrap and, by extension, other similar front-end frameworks, then this course is for you. Prof Jogesh's light-hearted approach to teaching is very interesting and makes learning a very big fun!",5

96641,Excellent course!!Thank you,5
96642,great course,5
96643,"Very good introductory course. You do have to be somewhat familiar with HTML, CSS and Javascript to get the most of it. The course is sometimes superficial, but it does teach you a lot in very little time. Great course!",5
96644,It is an easy course.,4
96645,It is highly recommended for introducing Bootstrap.,5
96646,Perfect course! Explanation is very good and the examples help you get through all assignment.,5
96647,Excellent course. Great instructor.,5
96648,Great explanations and exercises.,5
96649,"Great course. From my experience in Coursera, it is perfect presentation.Only one thing. Instead of inserting block of code, during exercise, better when instructor is typing the code. So, it comes to better realize for a student, feeling where he is, at the point.",5
96650,One of the best course in Front-End Web UI Framework in Coursera!!!!!!,5
96651,"I found this course greatly useful in learning everything about Bootstrap: from basic grid system to interactive classes, as well as javascript, jQuery and more.",5
96652,Excellent teaching process which makes you really learn the material to get the grades.,5
96653,I could learn and practice bootstrap components in this course.,5

96659,Very beneficial. And the professor is awesome.,5
96660,Great course. Great introduction to Bootstrap.,5
96661,it's really a deep look into the bootstrap frameworkIt's excellent to the newbies of bootstrap to cahge them from zeros to heros but for a man like me that have been working for 3 years with bootstrap it was tedious but had to take it to complete the speclization,5
96662,Thanks for all Prof. Joseph Muppala! Good Course!,5

96668,I enjoyed every detail. Best web learning experience so far.,5
96669,"I had used Bootstrap out of necessity in the past, picking up bits here and there. This course was excellent for filling in the gaps and giving a proper overview of Bootstrap and how it can (and should) be used for front-end development.",5
96670,It is awesome,5
96671,Not the best tutor but perhaps one of the worst. Hard to understand what he's trying to say.,1
96672,Thank you for an excellent course!,5
96673,Great!,5
96674,I found week two to really outweigh the others in terms of difficulty in the assignment but It's probably the week I learnt the most! Great Job!!,4
96675,"Amma mia ! ,Good course.",5
96676,Awesome teacher and course !,5
96677,Very intersting and exiting work please keep going.,5

96681,I Learnt a lot. Thank you,4
96682,It was an excellent course!!,5
96683,"Great course, great instructor, lot of interesting material!",5
96684,"As an experienced web developer, I'm not sure I'm in the ""target"" for this course, but it covers all important principles in Bootstrap, shows how to use most components, and gives pointers to more advanced articles that are really interesting. So it's 5 stars for me : I learned all I need to know to become proficient with Bootstrap on my enterprise projects !",5
96685,very interesting and course. I recommend it highly. steep learning curve,5
96686,Well formed with lots of details course!,5
96687,"Good coverage of bootstrap, but the other parts were very briefly touched upon (nodejs, bower etc.)",3
96688,really nice course! Check It Out!,5
96689,Straight forward and involving,5
96690,I like thecourse.I think it's benifi,5
96691,Prof. Muppala is a great instructor. This was a very engaging course.,5
96692,A great course.,4
96693,"I wish, the professor could pay more attention to from questions from students.",3
96694,"This is the second course in the Full Stack series by Hong Kong University. Because I find the first course in this series very interesting (the assignments are challenging and easy to understand; the professor does a very good job in explaining the materials), I continue to take the second course, which is this one, a shoot. However, it is a complete disappointment.In every single assignment, it requires a file, which is built by going through every single lectures of the course. That means I have to go through every videos and copy his code to my code in order to get the file. If you have a lot of time, that is perfectly fine. However, if you are a college student like me, you properly will not be able to commit that much time. Personally, when I take a course, I take a look at the assignment and then see what knowledge I need to have in order to complete the assignment. Because of this, I may watch the lecture or just Google out the answer. Requiring a file in order to complete an assignment strips away my liberty in doing so. Furthermore, if you miss a step in the video, your file may very well be ruined and you need to rewatch the video again to see what you missed.Also, the course is extremely slow paced. I have to play back rate to x1.5 normal speed. Sadly, even with faster speed, the lectures are also poorly structured. There are many other materials online that can cover the same amount of information in less time and easier to understand. Combined with the required file for each assignment, this course can easily be a torture.",2
96695,"Great introduction to using Bootstrap properly as well as basic use of node, Less and bower",5
96696,Instructions are very clear and very useful!,5
96697,"I enjoyed this quite a bit. I already knew some bootstrap, but following along in this course really cemented the ideas well and showed me new views on the material.",4
96698,NIce Examples of bootstrap and good idea about bower library package manager and node.js,4
96699,Very good course on Boostrap. It was great to have an introduction to this framework. The teachers did a good job in explaining the concepts. The videos and the materials are very good.It would be great to have a follow-up course to learn more advanced stuff.,4
96700,The explanation with examples is pretty clear to understand.Course contents are perfect.,5
96701,I had a lot of fun completing this one.,5
96702,An excellent course about bootstrap with excellent content videos and exercises,5
96703,Good explanations of all bootstrap materials.The last assignments are just too easy.,5
96704,Very introductory course to Bootstrap!!,4
96705,Good course for greenhand.,4
96706,Fantastic materials and great instructor!,5
96707,"This Course is very useful for me , cause after this course I find a job of Front-End development",5
96708,"One of the best course I have taken in Coursera. Very well structured, the professor makes every concept looks really simple. The assignments are the best part, they give us the confidence you need to start designing your own responsive front-end web application from scratch. The level is suitable for beginner and mid-level.",5
96709,"A good course, content are a little bit too much in 4 weeks study. Exercises and assignment are easy.",4
96710,Very well done with excellent videos and examples. Great intro to Bootstrap.,5

96713,very comprehensive and good introduction to Bootstrap and jQuery,4
96714,Very helpful. I would recommend.,5
96715,Very good course for introductory purposes nevertheless practice makes perfection,5
96716,"preety boring, lots of code copying.",2
96717,I prefer anonymous classmates reviewing.,4
96718,very explanative,5
96719,"Well structured, and covers most topics in Bootstrap and more. Strongly recommended, and looking forward to the coming courses.",5
96720,This is so much building me from ground up.,5
96721,Really liked the structure of the course. Concepts were introduced gracefully. These were then well practised with detailed examples. The comments added by Professor Jogesh were quite refreshing too.,5
96722,Teacher is very smart and he use a really nice methodology,5
96723,It is easy and interesting.,4
96724,"First of all, Thank you for the video. I liked it very much. Course is in very detailed indeed with lots of information.",5
96725,Great course. Thanks for your time mr. Muppala :),5
96726,"Course was amazing , Moreover the professor knows how to deliver the content and make it simple and easy.Good part it starts from scratch to build a web with bootstrap.",5
96727,Excellent and very useful course!!!,5
96728,Good course.,4
96729,A very informative course,5
96730,Very good but should be longer,4
96731,Great course. exercise and assignment are carefully designed to reiterate the concept. Practical tools are like LESS/SASS are covered. The approach to have students help grade each other homework is very good.,5
96732,Great job and a detailed explanation.,5
96733,I really like this course. It provides a wide aspect of bootstrap and good exercise. Learned a lot from this course.,5
96734,This topic and especially a whole course is mandatory for any front-end developer. Thank you!,5
96735,"enjoyed the course a lot! Our professor made this course what it is, thank you!",5
96736,"This is the best teacher, you learn a lot in a short time.",5
96737,Excellent course with useful examples. I really recommend this course.,5
96738,Genial!!!!!!Awesome!!!!!,5
96739,"Although the course structure and information is great, the course exercise and grading organization has a lot of space for improvement. Current structure doesn't make it possible for the learner to determine the speed. All the parts are equally important. You have to carefully go through hours of instructions.Each week and the assignment builds on what you have done before, but there are no checkpoints where you can verify your code matches the actual expectations. This causes a lot of confusion.Peer evaluation rules are not shown before you submit your work. After submitting my work, I discovered that there are requirements that were not in the assignment.",3
96740,Excellent course. One of the best tech courses I've taken. I'm experienced in Java technologies but only back-end and Swing. And now it opens me a whole new world.I'm grateful. Thank you.The only drawback is that I really want to pay for the entire Full Web Development course but I can't find a way to pay for all the courses and keep the grades I got in the first two courses.Thank you!,5
96741,Excellent course! A great way to learn the basics of Bootstrap.,5
96742,This is where I started to open the new beautiful world of Front-End Web Development :),5
96743,The best one.,5
96744,"Professor, I truly enjoyed your course. The exercises were very clear and you are an amazing teacher! Thanks so much!",5
96745,Proffesor Jogesh K. Muppala is probably the best instructor I have ever met in Coursera. He is active on discussions and really help us to understand the topic. He is also has a great sense of humor and his lecture videos are magnificent. Good Work :),5
96746,"Very good content, lots of exercises to get familiar, very good professor.",5
96747,Amazing course and the teachers are very funny,5
96748,"This course was awesome! I have been studying web development for quite a while--I even have several completed projects under my belt--but, this course filled in a ton of gaps in my knowledge. I expected to breeze through the material without learning much, but to my surprise, I learned something new in each lesson. Jogesh Muppala is an awesome professor. He explains things well and is very active in the course discussions. I would recommend any course he facilitates!!",5
96749,"It was simple yet useful, and the instructor is definitely a nice guy!",4
96750,Good introduction with practice.Unfortunately no certificate of accomplishment is available. This makes the Coursera platform less interesting.,4
96751,"A great course! A good mix of walkthroughs and challenges with a nice dose of humor mixed in. Jogesh is a great professor. If you want to learn bootstrap, look no further than this course!",5
96752,This course made my knowledge clear. There is a lot practice and thats cool.,5
96753,"Very thorough, hands-on.",5
96754,"This course is AMAZING!It was the BEST course I've ever taken in Coursera. Prof. Muppala is great, his lectures cover everything you need, so you do not feel lost at all although you learn pretty advanced stuff.. Course material is well-organized, and exercises go great with assignments. In short, this course is not like other introductory courses that just teach simple things or syntax. I really felt that I learned some stuff that I can actually use for my own projects.",5
96755,Thank you for this best lecture.,5
96756,"This one is much harder and time consuming, compared to the first course of the specialization.Also, to receive maximum points for assignment, you need to think ahead and make things assignment don't ask you directly (like ""removing the script if you're not using it, you'll receive 5 pts"").Good course anyway.",4
96757,Great Course!,5
96758,"Excellent course, simple and easy to follow instructions, very complete.",5
96759,I have learnt a lot in this course. It is a well thought interesting course. You will have to work hard but it is well worth it. Perfect courses 100%.,5
96760,"I like the course, I think it is complete",5
96761,Very interesting course ; the level is neither too easy nor too hard.Explanations from Jogesh are very clearThanks a lot,5
96762,"Thank you so much for the course. It is one of the best one I have had.The material was explained thoroughly, additional resources were extremely useful and the videos provided sufficient examples. Also, the teaching style (and humor) are greatly appreciated.I learned a lot, while also consolidating my knowledge from Mr. Rossiter's class (HTML, CSS and JS).Many thanks!",5
96763,Very good materials and practices. Thanks!,5
96764,"Excellent course. Good preparation for the course by instructor, and guidance in discussion forums. If you want to learn a good amount in short period of time, this is recommended. Nice set of assignments that give you a feeling of accomplishing something with what you are learning.",5
96765,"This course teach a lot and there is a lot of course requered and additional material. Everything is well explained and the instructor is awesome and funny. It is time demanding, but worth all the time you spend learning.",5
96766,"This course is a requisite for anyone wanting to learn and apply frameworks for client side web development. What takes this course to 5-stars is the instructor, Jogesh Muppala. Aside from his humour, he prepares the content of this course in such an unambiguous and clear format that I think the material would be enjoyed by even the most diehard non-techy. There is a wide assortment of Coursera experiences but I would say that this should be the type other instructors aspire to duplicate.",5
96767,"Great Course, hard fun!!!",5
96768,This course give me a great understanding on the bootstrap framework.I'm happy because I can now build awesome web interfaces with the skills that I have learned here.,5
96769,The best course for Bootstrap!!! Thanks a million!!!,5
96770,currently at week 2 - learning bootstrap is a great fun.,5
96771,I would like the course to be more dynamic.,2
96772,"The best course i ever attend to.Lectures are very good and the Teacher Jogesh K. Muppala is the Best of the Best, keep up with the excellent job.",5
96773,Very good course. Thank to Prof. Muppala!,5
96774,Great class and teacher,5
96775,Very good course on Bootstrap and its uses,5
96776,thank you profecsor,3
96777,Great course and material,5
96778,Its a good course. Covers all the basic concepts.,4
96779,the course contents are great and understandable but I have a problem with the lake of details information the instructor sometimes forget to provide..,3
96780,Excellent and clear instructor.,5
96781,"Great course, I love bootstrap!",5
96782,Very helpful to learn how to use Bootstraps,4
96783,Thanks for course.,5
96784,"It is interesting in the first weeks and at the time I did it I was living in a country that would qualify as subsistence marketplace so could see directly what was explained.However, felt it was a little rushed, repetitive and not very detailed or clear when it came to creating a business plan.",3
96785,"The best course ever, It change my life and the life from hundreds of people from my country already. Since the course I have learn more on how people living in poverty think, act, and feel. Understand these aspect will benefit people, or NGo to create sustainable solutions for them. Solutions are not easy but as the Instructor says: ""We mus try"".This course will benefit the students by applying the knowledge learn into actions, it will move each one of us to act, instead of sitting down and just analyze data. Is really an awesome experience and is an eye opener.",5
96786,"Even living into this kind of reality, the academic perspective shows how far is our understanding !!",5
96787,"Thanks to the instructor I enjoyed this course a lot. Waiting to the next one, ciao",5
96788,Great stuff to learn and teached by one of the greatest mind of our decade.,5
96789,My favorite Coursera class!,5
96790,Outstanding course!,5
96791,This is an amazing course.Thank you Dr Brown for allowing me to pursue this course from the comforts of my home.And thank you coursera.,5
96792,Very interesting Course.,5
96793,"Incredible Content on Display. Amazing Execution by the Profs. Besides fundamental prerequisites of physics and math(which are required) ,each topic is taken up from scratch and dealt with respect to its application.No wonder Caltech is the world leader in planetary science.Go Ahead and immerse yourselves!",5
96794,A great course!,4
96795,Shame I didn't get to see the updated lessons..,5
96796,"The Science of the Solar System is well worth taking and I would highly recommend it to anyone who has an interest in astronomy. Professor Brown is a wonderful teacher; he presents the course lectures in a style that promotes understanding, explaining facts carefully and fluently, often with a touch of humour. The guest lecturers also present their contributions in a focused and enjoyable manner.",5
96797,Extremely informative and fun! Perhaps update some material with the latest findings (e.g. results from the Dawn mission to Ceres as well as more details on the elusive Planet 9).Thank you nonetheless Prof. Brown for sharing your contagious enthusiasm for the science of solar system with us!,4
96798,"Excellent course with engaging speakers, and a good community.",5
96799,Absolutely fantastic course. It's both broad and rigorous and uses the appropriate math and chemistry to show how we know what we know.,5
96800,"The course taught me a lot, and was perfectly balanced between being informative and technical. Highly recommended.",5
96801,"I was excited when I got started with the course. When I completed it, I'd say that I became inspired to learn and find out more about the subject. The lessons are really interesting and thought-provoking at times. But if there will ever be a good find in this course, it is going to be Mike - an expert in the field of planetary science and one who is very enthusiastic about solar system. Best course!",5
96802,"Very good lecturer - keeps things interesting and uses of figures and results from published peer-reviewed papers. Explains things from first principles and does a very in depth historical analysis of the topics studied.Only criticism I would give would be to have more regular feedback or tests regarding what is learnt. There are 4 topics in this course for the 10 week duration and there's only a test at the end of each topic. A test at the end of each week would keep students on their toes.Nevertheless, still a 5 star course. Thanks for letting me take this!",5
96803,Very happy with the Mars unit above all.,5
96804,Absolutely fantastic,5
96805,This is a fantastic course. Professor Brown does an amazing job presenting the material.,5
96806,I really liked it.Interesting and thought provoking.,5
96807,"Loved every minute of it, could not do some of the maths, that otherwise very informative.Like Mike Brown's technique… Enjoy the humour!",5
96808,"This is an absolutely amazing class. You will learn a great deal about the story behind our solar system, and the competing theories behind some of what has happened. It's wonderful, interesting, and at times even funny. It is worth every second of frustration and effort I put in.I only took two science classes in college. If you have never taken a college level science class, this may be difficult. But it is extremely rewarding. If you struggle, keep fighting. You'll get there!",5
96809,The was the best course I've taken through Coursera. The material was fascinating. The instructor has a great enthusiasm for the topic and delivers his lectures in an engaging style. The test and quizzes were quite challenging. Can't recommend highly enough.,5
96810,The hardest and the most amazing course i have ever taken.Thank you Prof.Mike for this chance :),5
96811,Way over my head but has definitely given me a reason to pursue learning more about physics and the solar system.,5
96812,I don't want it to stop !,5
96813,"This course is amazing! Professor Mike Brown is great at what he does, and everything is well explained.",5
96814,"Wonderful course, fascinating, keeps me from dying of boredom in my day job. I'm already wondering how I'll cope when the lectures finish in two weeks.",5
96815,Excellent to view and understand our solar system and its evolution,5
96816,The best!,5
96817,"I love Prof Brown's enthusiasm. He is very engaging, clearly he enjoys reaching so many students around the world. His efforts are much appreciated!I'm taking this course more from data science's point of view. I need to understand concepts and a bit of physics and maths in order to run my tests but not to the degree of an astronomer (not yet, anyway). It's been hugely educational and interesting.",5
96818,"Fantastic teacher, amazingly well-prepared contents. It's incredible that they are doing this for free.",5
96819,"Who only five stars? Because that is all I have to give. I'm sorry, this course deserves more.I am repeating this course,but not because I need to. I passed last year, but I know that there will be new material that I want to learn. I'm pleased to see that there are familiar faces from last year.Prof. Mike Brown obviously know his stuff, and enjoys communicating it to students. There are plenty of references for students who want to explore things further. The discussion forums are excellent, with people sharing information, and Mike somehow finds the time to monitor the forums and contribute to the discussion.",5
96820,"While there are a few technical issues, this is an awesome course. Not only is it is very detailed and informative, but entertaining and sometimes even amusing. Being so detailed and informative, a lot of the material is quite challenging. The tests in particular are tough. However, I highly recommend this course because it will make you really appreciate astronomy as a field and the solar system.",5
96821,The best MOOC out of 60 I have passed.,5
96822,Thoroughly enjoyed the insights and approach!,5
96823,Excellent introduction to team culture for leaders. Understanding different cultures for businesses in a global stage is essential to build products and services that are true to the cultures of the origin and also destination.,5
96824,very good and useful course,5
96825,"an excellent course - Greg Urban is an excellent, informed teacher with great techniques for teaching and learning.",5
96826,Absolutely wonderful information that has opened my eyes to so many aspects of my different social circles and the science behind why we do the things we do as a collective.Very inspiring research!Looking forward to making my way through the specialization.Thank you!,5
96827,"The contents of the course are definitely insightful and approrpriately based on scientific research. Dr. Greg Urban is extremely knowleadgeable on the topic.The reason why I am not giving the course a higher rate is because: 1) I find the pace of the course is quite slow, 2) the inactivity in the discussion forums and the lack of peer reviews in the assignments reduces its interactivity and 3) both the contents and grading system are very theoretical.Still, I would recommend this course as it provides a solid foundation on the principles behind the dynamics of culture.",3
96828,"That was quite a fascinating course, at least for someone who does not know anything about anthropology. The tutor did an outstanding job and also provided good readings. Highly recommended.",5
96829,"Really enjoyed Greg's teaching style. Modern, relevant and informal. Greg demonstrated the importance of understanding culture to identify values, ideas and the skills needed to build upon culture to foster success within teams and organizations.",5
96830,This is the course where the technicality comes into play!!!!,5
96831,"This was a very good course , I liked it a lot!",5
96832,I liked this informative and interactive GIS skill development course.,5
96833,"Good pace, good instruction",4
96834,Awesome course,5
96835,Challenging but easily attainable with the resources and education provided,5
96836,I love this course very much.,5
96837,I really enjoyed the course. Thank you.,5
96838,The course just maximizes the urge to do more despite the challenges in waking up at night to work on assignment....I love it.,5
96839,Peer review is not best way to grade if requires some form of subjective judgement from people that maybe are not the very qualified to provide it.,3
96840,"This class had a lot of good material and it truly showed how powerful GIS is in analysis. My recommendation would be for this class to be broken into two sessions to really practice everything that was taught in the videos. However, I plan on doing this on my own through the GIS help boxes before I take the 4th class.",3
96841,Gives hands on experience of practical problem,5
96842,"It was well designed,informative course.I felt it was the course specially meant for me.",5
96843,Great course and great tools to analyse geographic data.,5
96844,Great course. Awesome instructor.,5
96845,Good chance for learners to indulge more practically than just theoretical work.,4
96846,Wooow great course,5
96847,Excellent course. Highly recommended. Thanks for all!,5
96848,I Love every thing about GIS & Coursera,5
96849,"This was very demanding course for me. However, at the end that is the only way one can learn things properly. Video lessons are interesting as well as exercises, and the tools and workflows that have been shown to us have been very clearly explained and demonstrated. I hope I will be able to continue with next course in a row and finally finish Capstone Project and earn the Certificate.",5
96850,Haven't seen an online resource that has taught GIS better than this. And by a long shot! Loved the course. All courses have been awesome and build on themselves well,5
96851,"An excellent course. Well paced, comprehensive, delivers on many of the promises that the specialisation makes. My ranking above relates to course content and lecturer (who actively participates in the discussion forums).I do however have great disdain for Coursera's downright abysmal handling of course rescheduling that saw it magically reappear after being cancelled and announced to enrolled students only two days before assessed content was due. Numerous student concerns were subsequently brushed off by support staff. Highly unprofessional.",5
96852,"Very demanding and rewarding. The course is full of detailed videos and practical work, and the final project helps to make sense of it all.",5
96853,Very informative,5
96854,Great course helping to extend skills for people interested in spatial analysis,5
96855,This course covers some of the most useful geoprocessing tools. I highly recommend it.,5
96856,New knowledge about 3D map. Interesting.,5
96857,its really good,5
96858,very helpful Courses & Good teach,5
96859,Excellent course. I really recommend it.,5
96860,I enjoyed the course very much but found the assignment very frustrating. Despite trying numerous ways with the data provided I did not get the same map coverage as the instructor and there was no explanation as to what I might have done differently despite a number of people asking the same question in the forums. It was still possible to get full marks without but it would have been more satisfying to get the same answer.,4
96861,"The idea of work a project in example project in this course was fanatic , let you to learn and practice more.",5
96862,Another good course in this specialisation.,4
96863,I enjoy this course a lot. It very good.,4
96864,I've got to work hard to finish this course. Thank you Coursera for sponsoring my studies.,5
96865,"very rich and practical, yet simple. It covers what it's all about.",5
96866,"I guess, the this course need to be enpowered by practical case",4
96867,"Excellent course, especially if you're involved in mutiple projects at once. It helps you distill the reasons why you would run a startup or get involved in one. You learn to see through the details of the day and look at fundamental principles of many startup projects.",5
96868,Thanks for offering this course as MOOC on Cursera.,4
96869,"Great sources of information, prominent guests and speakers, high quality learning. Moderately lenient in course load, assignments, quizzes, and peer-reviews.",5
96870,"This course is great and I found it very complementary to the Berklee Improv course. This is more advanced and it dives deeper. But it is less ""hands on"". My only remark is that people would benefit more from it if it had some practical homework beyond quizzes and if the material was made available in a nice format.",4
96871,Great course. I really enjoyed it and learnt a lot.,5
96872,Practical and useful information,5
96873,"Pratical, straight foward and elusive.",5
96874,"This course was wonderful! A great deep dive into all the theory behind the blues, the various harmonizations and the music theory behind them, as well as a number of great concrete examples of song analysis, composition and improvisation. I recommend it to anyone interested in the blues!",5
96875,"Thanks a lot, Dariusz Terefenko! You are a terrific teaching and outstanding musician! This course changed the way I thought about music, it really made the difference!",5
96876,"I found this course to be very informative. I am a self-taught amateur musician, and this course really helped me see the underlying connections amongst the various music theory concepts, especially those pertaining to harmony and improvisation, that I have tried to learn on my own. Using the historical evolution of the blues as the underlying pedagogic tool is a great idea and really helped my understanding. And I think it will also help my appreciation for jazz going forward.The only regret I have is that I do not know how to play piano (I am a guitarist), although I am in the process of teaching myself how to play (I am literally just about a month in). Once I have started building my ""chops"", I plan to come back to these lectures and apply them to my piano studies.Many thanks to Professor Terefenko and the forum moderators for a great learning experience!",5
96877,This is very practical and useful course. I really learned something from it! I love this courser and I strongly recommend this course to everyone who is fascinated in Blues.,5
96878,"Brings together a lot of the 'book' theory in a pretty comprehensive and comprehensible form, with playing examples individually and in ensemble. Having struggled with some of this material in the past, I found Dariusz explanations really helped me move my comprehension of this subject area along quite dramatically.",5
96879,A very comprehensive course with clear explanation on the various type of the progressions and scales used in Jazz and Blues music.,5
96880,"This is perfect course that overviews jazz blues evolution over time. It introduces the ideas to investigate both for soloist to improvise melodies, as well as for other musicians to provide harmonic and rhytmic context for soloist. It suggests very useful exercises to everybody, that will help to develop modulation and improvisation skills. Throughout the course I understood harmonies of many songs I tried to play before, and now I am able to better improvise on them.",5
96881,"The Course Contents Quality is very good overall. The explanations applied to the instruments are also beautifully done. I like the historical references and the evolution of the course. This course is probably heavy for someone new as the concepts are not basic as the course advances. However for someone who already has good basic this course is excellent, it is well organized and very well presented including the performances. Thanks i really loved this course.",5
96882,"Excellent introduction into the subject. A lot of theory and practical illustrations. Surely, to master the material entirely you should practice for years. But the course gives a thorough overview of what the blues means. If you don't learn how to play it you at least will understand what happens there. My only critics is that I did not found any written materials that are used in the lectures. I don't understand why. I used the printscreen button to get examples from the videos. Would not it be much easier to include the music sheets that are disposed publicly anyway.",5
96883,"Great course and great instructor!! I will be delving into this material for a long, long time!! Thank You!",5
96884,"This is an informative course for anyone interested in improvisation, regardless of your current level of achievement. If you have learned by yourself, with the help of instructors or friends over the years, you will find this course of benefit for filling in the holes of your knowledge. if you are a beginning or intermediate student, it is highly recommended as a means of understanding how to improvise. There are plenty for opportunities to practice with a rhythm section which is a great opportunity.",5
96885,"This course presents the relationships between various aspects of composition and performance in a clearly structured manner, demystifying much about blues jazz that had confused me before. This has improved my musicianship, but more so my music appreciation.",5
96886,"Congratulations to teacher and other musicians. This is a very nice course that helped filling several empty blocks on my knowledge.I´d like to have all piano plays in complete musical score to better follow.Question: Couldn´t you save it as midi and turn it available to registered students or capture this midi recordings and represent it as staff?Suggestion for next turn: Do a carefull revision on subtitles. They have several (inaudible) blanks and some words that have nothing to do to the context, or simply do not exist. For a non English mother tongue speaker person, bad written words add an extra difficulty to understand each new information. (I have used subtitles, stopping the film and fixing concepts by reading these subtitles)Best regards, Victor M A Garcia",5
96887,"Excellent course. It is all about theory, which is fantastic, with some facility provided to enable improvisation. It would be great to extend this course to a hands-on improvisation. How about a part 2 - practical implementation of the introduced improvisational concepts?Many thanks to prof. Terefenko and the band members - what a gathering of talent!Best regards,Pawel Slomowicz",5
96888,This is a GREAT course. There is absolutely a wealth of knowledge that you can build on for a lifetime of jazz and blues! 5 stars,5
96889,"The most interesting and complete course about the blues I've have ever seen! Structured, clear and very kind form of teaching. Thank you, Dariusz!",5
96890,"This was the best music course I have ever taken. Thanks to Professor Terefenko, the Eastman School of Music, the talented musicians who composed and performed pieces, and Coursera. I have learned a lot of new ways to practice. The ear training and the explanations of the theory were very helpful.",5
96891,Compact and informative lectures that de-mystify the art form. Thank you!(Will need to practice a lot for it all to sink in though),5
96892,It's a very useful course. Really worth it!!!My congratulations to Professor.,5
96893,Love the theory discussion and performances.,5
96894,Fantastic material that will give me years of stuff to work on!,5
96895,I got a lot from this course. It looks a bit technical and demanding at first but worth sticking with. There are useful ideas to help understand and apply the course content to practice and hearing music.One minor point - the video subtitles could do with an edit.,5
96896,"Excellent course. I thought the explanations about Jazz theory were well grounded when demonstrated by the students playing. Lots of great tips and complex ideas brought to life by great performances. A course in Blues that I could probably do again, it was so good.",5
96897,Excellent! Thank you -,5
96898,"Great course- thank you, Dariusz!",5
96899,A fantastic introduction to how Jazz was formed and relates to the blues. What an inspiration Professor Dariusz Terefenko is.,5
96900,Thank you so much for this opportunity! Awesome experience.,5
96901,5 star recommended! all courses offered by Rochester especially music course were in very high quality!,5
96902,"I think this is a very complete course that teaches in detail the history and development of The Blues, backed up by extent theoretical content. I definetely learned a lot from it and also gave me all i need to continue developing my playng skills. Thanks to Coursera and all the people involved in the creation of this course.",5
96903,"This course provides a thorough overview of harmonic and rhythmic devices useful for jazz-influenced approaches to playing the blues. I enjoyed it very much, especially the rhythm-focused bits, which are often overlooked.",5
96904,really excellent.,5
96905,Had fun taking this class and learned some new things. thank you.,5
96906,"Awesome course, especially for Jazz pianists!",5
96907,Such a great course! Even though I am a bass player this course has made me understand patterns and ways in which the Blues can be taken to. Thank you very much for such an amazing experience.,5
96908,"A very comprehensive and well-thought out approach to the Blues, improvisation, and practice techniques that will be invaluable as I go forward in my study of improvisation. Very enjoyable and great to hear the wonderful players - I was particularly impressed with Tyrone - what a fabulous bassist!!",5
96909,EXCELLENT COURSE THE BEST BLUES COURSE. I RECOMMEND THIS COURSE FOR STUDENTS ADVANCED AND BEGINNERS.,5
96910,"The assignments are not really commensurate to the content, i.e. they are much simpler and superficial and do not really test the content, which is deeper and implies practical activities difficult to measure. The title is also partially misleading, at least for me, and I would rather call it a blues introduction to jazz improvisation. But the content and the exercises proposed are great, one of the best and no nonsense approach to bebop improvisation I've ever found",5
96911,"I find this course to be very practical and very rewarding. After a week I can come up with two-handed chords and comp with a singer or a soloist (after some prep right now). I found the various options for improvising to be very informative. I enjoy the teacher very much, he is enthusiastic and friendly and has excellent tips for practicing. I like the way the course is structured, working from a simple blues to more involved but still conforming to the basic blues structure.I was fascinated by pentatonic chords and I am determined to come up with an arrangement of my own using these chord types. The drop-2 approach is a very useful way to get a great sound and is useful for comping. Guide tones and voice leading are extremely useful also and an essential tool in any jazz performer's portfolio.I plan to practice these various methods and I will probably buy the teacher's book to see if I can advance my skills further.I plan to use the play-along sessions to improve my improvising skills. I really enjoy playing with the band! Thank you so much for this great course.",5
96912,"This course is not for me.Principal concepts seem very difficult from the first lesson.Professor hesitates, quiz is incomprehensible.So, Good Bye ! I do like blues and listen it very often, but this doesn't help me.",2
96913,"Excellent course. The lectures are well organized and illustrated with good examples. This professor not only has a remarkable fund of knowledge but understands how to teach the material focussing on key points, practical tips and fun. I will certainly obtain his book to continue learning and hope he will consider teaching additional courses on this site.",5
96914,"It´s an excelent course, with a lot of material to study for long time. The explanations are clear and step by step. Professor Dariusz Terefenko is a great teacher and also a great player. Their students play great demonstrations on explained topics. I learn a lot about, otherwise difficult topics, on jazz styles, jazz harmony and improvisation using modes and other techniques. All applied over 12 bar blues structure.",5
96915,"Excellent class. Interesting, informative and with practical application. Highly recommended.",5
96916,excellent! great course for undertanding the blues and its evolution!,5
96917,"It seemed to be more jazz than blues, but it was entertaining and educational.",4
96918,"I've done quite a few online courses and have been studying Jazz intensively and seriously since 2009. This is, hands down, the best course I've found on the subject of improvisation - because it is so carefully organized and well explained. Mr. Terefenko does an amazing job taking you through the various blues types and improvisational devices. My only regret is that I didn't find years ago, as I was starting! Absolutely top material.",5
96919,Excellent course. It goes deep into the core of the blues while showing tools for improvisation,5
96920,"great course, do it again",5
96921,Very good course for all musicians. Explains advanced blues and jazz theory in easy way. Very interesting material about the music history and harmony evaluation.,5
96922,Really good!,5
96923,"An exceptionally good course on jazz theory and improvisation. Don't let the name mislead you, the blues is used in this course as the basis for form, harmonic and melodic improvasition, but this is a Jazz theory course, not a Blues (in the traditional sense) course. I recommend this course empahtically for anyone wanting to learn jazz improvisation. It is a good complement to another Coursera course, Jazz Improvisation by Gary Burton, which is also excellent, but more focused on melodic improvisation and with a more pratical approach.",5
96924,I've learnt a lot from this course. Thanks!,5
96925,"This a formidable course that has given me a thourough understanding of jazz harmony, of the development of jazz harmonic language exemplified by the blues, and a plethora of practical exercises, both ear training and (primarily keyboard) playing. The play-along tracks are very useful, too, and last, but not least, it was wonderful to listen to the talented young jazz music students, who demonstrated various aspects of the subjects taught.",5
96926,Excellent instructor and course on fundamentals of the blues and jazz. Please continue more similar courses!,5
96927,Excellent presentation of the theory and very nice examples and analysis.,5
96928,Best course I had here so far.,5
96929,Although I don't have any musical background I really enjoyed this course and have learned and understood a bit more about the blues.Thanks to the Professor and the musicians for giving their time and effort to make this MOOC a reality.Much appreciated.,5
96930,"At first I though it was a very poor course but certain parts of it were gold for me and I got a lot out of it. I particularly appreciated the advice on how to improvise through out the course. I was less keen on the parts on modes and pentatonics but on the other hand for someone further along in their musical journey it may be just the thing. Although the course is ostensibly on the blues it also covers a lot of material relevant to Jazz.Pedagogically there were some problems.I think the course has way too much material and could be split into 2 parts each part maybe a bit slower.The presenter need to sharpen up his game a little as regards presentation skills, reading material of an IPad is not very inspiring. His English is not very idiomatic but that's not really a big problem. Written sheets with the changes and summarizing the lectures would have made the course better. Finally there are no peer reviews and all quizzes are theoretical - rather disappointing. I prefer a hands on approach with peer based reviews as in Gary Burton's course also on Coursera.",3
96931,Excellent content and faculty ! thoroughly enjoying it : )Thanks a lot to all who have worked towadrds making this material available,5
96932,Very useful! The educators of the course explained the concepts and processes very clearly with many examples. Thank you for this!,5
96933,"Five stars for the excellent teachers and content, but the course is not made for Coursera: very long videos, slides full of words, many references to the group work for the course at JHU, tiny quizzes and just two practical assignments. The format and the examinations can be definitely improved.",3
96934,Good course!,5
96935,excellent information for researcher..,4
96936,"Than; you very very much, i hope i can join you soon",5
96937,I enjoy learning from coursera. It is easy to navigate and concise.,5
96938,Easily understandable well designed course Modules with flexibility to choose time and target dates.Module assessment formats are very simple and user friendly.Peer Graded assignments were self explanatory to answer the questions .Overall i have enjoyed the content and the course,5
96939,interesting and well organised course,5
96940,"Great introductory course, highly recommended as a first timer or for a brush up !",5
96941,"Very useful course and great lecturers, i really enjoyed the time.. thank you very much",5
96942,a great course on basics in systematic reviews and meta- analysis. Thank you!,5
96943,"It is very useful course for beginners and although those who have done systematic reviews/meta-analysis before in order to improve their basic understanding. There are few shortcomings with the course:1- lectures frequently refer to biostat and epidemiology classes, but no reference or links has been provided for these classes.2- The course ends without any lectures on meta-regression and sensitivity analysis, which is a bit confusing as the module 8 promises such lectures.",4
96944,"Very informative, engaging and helpful! I found it refreshing to listen to the experiences and knowledge from the three instructors, and to put my own knowledge to the test in the weekly quiz sections.",5
96945,this course was very informative. excellent,5
96946,The best systematic review and meta analysis course I have taken thus far. Great information and delivery!!,5
96947,"clear knowledge structure,easily understandable language,necessary evidence to support viewpoint,and supplementary of working tools and interactive tests.perfect course",5
96948,Very nice and useful course :) Enjoyed it a lot.,5
96949,Very informative and systematic. But have to pay attention to the terms because it can be quiet difficult for the beginners in this field.,5
96950,Very helpful course. Strongly suggested!,5
96951,"Great course, thanks to the professors. Now I feel more confident reading and planning systematics reviews.",5
96952,"Great content, but not delivered in a very dynamic manner so hard to stay attentive.",3
96953,good material and knowledge ... but some how boring ...,4
96954,Incredible course! You learned a lot from these amazing professors. If you take this course you will know how to do a high quality systematic review and even a meta analysis and publish them.,5
96955,"Excellent teachers, great experience. Gained new knowledge thanks to a well paced set-up of the course and the effort of the professors from the Johns Hopkins University. Successfully published a meta-analysis after the course, in a peer reviewed journal on the SCI list.",5
96956,The lesson are very simple and well discussed. I hope there can be more activities as this needs more application to be practiced. I hope there can be a follow up course on this.,5
96957,"Very well organized, chock full of both theoretical content and details regarding application. Just the right amount of challenging! Would have been nice to have had more exercises that force you to use the information learned in actually choosing/not choosing studies, or writing about the literature systematically. Overall, highly recommend.",5
96958,Great course.,5
96959,thank you very much,4
96960,It is Amazing course thanks for JHH and thanks for Coursera.,5
96961,Great course!,5
96962,Thank you so much for your expertise,5
96963,I think the course was very informative.,5
96964,"After meta-analysing the topics of this course, the p value was found to be statistically significant. Overall, it was fantastic, thanks to the tutors who made it simple to digest. However, it could have been more crunchy if there were topics that explored (even if introductory) using a statististical software like Stata, ReVman, R etc to conduct a meta-analysis. Peace!!",5
96965,This course helps me a lot to organise and support my articles that I am writing. It was perfect!,5
96966,This course is awesome! I love it so much,5
96967,it's really helpful course thank u so much. Musab,5
96968,Excellent introductory material!,4
96969,Good introduction and overview to Systematic Reviews.,5
96970,Excellent Course. The lectures were very clear and crisp with good examples. The method of evaluation was excellent.,5
96971,Thank you so much. Hoping to apply these concepts ahead.,5
96972,Outstanding organization and mix of didactic pedagological techniques !Highly recommended for all interested in improved their understanding of SR and MA critical appraisal of the literature as well as performing your own SR with or without a MA.,5
96973,Excellent Course that will easily Guide you through the journey of systematic review and meta-analysis but requires full attention !!,5
96974,"This is an excellent course provided by Johns Hopkins. It provides excellent lectures for the basic topics to design and interpret a systematic review, with or without quantitative synthesis (i.e., meta-analysis). I would like, though, to better understand other topics, such as network meta-analysis, trial sequential analysis and other methodologies potentially applicable to this important research tool.",5
96975,Great,5
96976,A good course that lacked practical information on performing a meta-analysis.,3
96977,i think it is wonderful work ;i'm really proud of it and it will help me in the following days.thanks,5
96978,Wonderful learning opportunities,5
96979,my first education with coursea. Awesome.,5
96980,very informative and easy to understand!,5
96981,"Excellent course! Lectures are comprehensive and concise, and the lecturers explained the topics well. Quizzes and peer review exams test our understanding of the modules well, and I appreciate the book recommendations.",5
96982,It was comprehensive and worth course to take upon. I would recommend to add course about detailed methodology behind conducting meta-analysis.,4
96983,"Amazing course, definitely learned a lot regarding systematic reviews. The only thing I found to be a bit challenging is that at some lectures they assume you have previous knowledge in stats, while for someone like me this is my first stats course. But don't worry, it doesn't interfere a lot without your overall understanding of systematic reviews.Note: it focuses a lot more on systematic review that it does on meta-analysis, which kind of makes sense because meta-analysis is only an optional component of a systematic review, as you'll get to know in this course.",5
96984,Covered basic information regarding systematic review and meta-analysis. Certain tools were introduced.,5
96985,The course is great as an introductory course to Meta-Analysis. I feel like I know a lot more about Meta-Analysis now.,4
96986,"I never had prior exposure to online courses, this is my first experience and I am very happy to complete the course successfully. It was a very good forum and an excellent opportunity to learn about systematic reviews and meta-analysis from one among the world class university. I express my sincere thanks to Coursera and Johns Hopkins University for providing an excellent course.",5
96987,"Awesome course. Content was delivered in a clear, concise, and precise manner.",5
96988,I would highly recommend this course. It was very informative and I hope Johns Hopkins will continue more in this series. Systematic reviews and meta analyses have become crucial for clinical research and evidence based medicine. This course allows users to gain basic knowledge about both. Great initiative.,5
96989,"systematic meta analysis is good for madecine postguaduate stu,it is helpfui!!!",5
96990,"It is very organized course, I earned a lot of information ... thanks",5
96991,Fantastic! Lots of excellent and useful information.,5
96992,Fantastic course. I hope a degree on this should be made available online. Thanks to the tutors. Your videos and explanation and transcription was clear.,5
96993,"Very good course, it help me alot.",5
96994,"Meta-analysis 101.This course introduces some basic concepts of evidence-based medicine and meta-analysis. The peer assignments are well designed, which encourage students to read papers critically.However, practical and advanced meta-analysis skills are not introduced in lectures. Looking forward to future advanced courses!",4
96995,Gorgeous!,5
96996,great course with informative and clear knowledge gained. I've benefited a lot from it.,5
96997,Great introduction not only for systematic review but also for scientific research.,5
96998,A terrific course.,5
96999,very useful,4
97000,"The course is a good introduction to the topic, however, it is a pity that there is no follow up to the course. At the end of the course you will not be able to perform a SLR + meta-analysis.",4
97001,Great introduction to the process of conducting and reading a systematic review!,5
97002,It's a very good introductory course to systematic reviews.,4
97003,"It's a good course to have a first approach to meta-analysis, not for a deep comprehension or for acquisition of advanced techniques about meta-analysis data menagement. I hope you will organize an advanced course about this issues. Thank you!!",5
97004,Good introduction to conducting systematic reviews in general and a teaser for doing meta-analysis. I enjoyed it!,4
97005,Very well organized and very informative.,4
97006,"Excellent course for students and researchers who want to start exploring systematic reviews and meta-analysis! There some few minor problem with the materials. Also, I wished there more advanced information regarding meta-analysis. Maybe you can develop an second course :)",4
97007,Very well explained. It takes you step by step into the vast world of systematic review,5
97008,This is an excellent introduction to the world of systematic reviews and meta-analysis. I enjoyed the detailed information on every step of this research methodology.,5
97009,"Great introduction to systematic reviews and meta-analysis, it also gives you the tools you will need to continue your studies in the subject.",5
97010,"A very detailed course about writing a systematic review, still helped me to gain better understanding while reading one as a clinician.",5
97011,One of the best courses coming from Johns Hopkins University. Assignments are meaningful and teachings are very engaging. This gave the topic of systematic review and meta-analysis a rigorous treatment.,5
97012,"Extremely important for every one, whether clinician, researcher or both.",5
97013,Very nice course! I wish I had like this when doing my master's degree.Special thanks for teachers speaking in a very understandable way (very good for non-native english-speakers),5
97014,Really good course,5
97015,excellent course with good relevant information,5
97016,"Well matured course that provides a great digest over a very complex topic and is a fantastic gateway to get started on the topic. Don't expect a terribly engaging set of presentations, but it is factually very useful and worth the time for those relatively new to the subject. I found the amount of content easy to handle on the side, while working full time.",4
97017,i get benefit from the course. the explanation is to the point and in an easy and simple way that can be easily understanable,5
97018,Hopkins across the world is the latest idea. Thanks Coursera for such an awesome gift!,5
97019,Great intro to the topic. Nice lecture content and presenters. Left me wanting more! I wish there was an advanced course as a follow up.,5
97020,"i found this course a great intro to the concept of systematic review which is a special type of research that helps resolve conflicts in published studies, provide evidence for healthcare practices and policies and identify the the area in which research is lacking hence orienting it.",5
97021,"The audio quality of a lot of the lectures are quite bad.A number of the slides seem to be un-organised at times, with repeating information, making them confusing.While all the information seems to be presented, it feels like it could be done better with more time spent preparing and recording the videos.",2
97022,Step-by-step way to learn the systematic review and meta-analysis,5
97023,brief and practical,5
97024,"Concept of the course is clear, it is easy to master. And is useful for scientific research work.",5
97025,"It is a good course,It is useful.",5
97026,"Just finished the free mode course. This course is really great. I was expecting a lot from it, and I am very surprised it exceeded my expectations.",5
97027,Really Great.,5
97028,"This is an amazing course! You learn not only the correct way to pronounce words, but you also become a better listener as you now have a ""logic"" rather than an intuitive understanding about how to speak that most teachers don't really teach you.",5
97029,Excellent courseThank you. God bless you,5
97030,"this course was really helpful for me as a teacher I liked the topics, the structures and i'm crazy about the lecturer. I would like to take certificate but unfortunately my salary is hardly enough for food and communal expenses.so I highly recommend everyone to take this course.",5
97031,I am increasing in knowledge. Great information. Happy to be here !,5

97043,Very useful course,5
97044,It was a really helpful for teaching area and worthy to join this course.,5
97045,It´s nice,5
97046,This is a very good course for the beginners.,4
97047,The fact that the essays was peer reviewed made me skeptical about the credibility of this course.,4
97048,"This course helped me to improve my performance, now I have better confidence to teach my next students.",5
97049,It was an amazing experience,3
97050,I only lived all the way to teach how to teach and learn how to be a good teacher !! I recommend this course to people who want to be an excellent teacher !,5
97051,"Great guide, easy to understand, very relevant content!",5
97052,"Excellent!! I love the organization of the themes, the professor and his calm voice, the passion that he showed for education... everything. I have a master's in Education, most of the concepts were known by me but they were presented i such way that I not only enjoyed, I expanded what I knew. The evaluation process was great. Different than other course I have been taking, the questions were actually well thought out aiming to assess my understanding of the subject as a whole, not my attention to details of the lecture.",5
97053,This course was very interesting. It gave me many things to think about as I prepare to become a teacher. I liked the different articles and I now have different ways to think about teaching and learning.,5
97054,This course is very interesting . It provides clarity on fundamental questions about learning. Must watch for teach,5
97055,"It was really boring, hard to keep watching the videos and doing the activities. There was some stuff that could be interesting but you can find it somewhere else.",1
97056,It has opened a wider view about teaching that is ahead of us we have to follow.,5
97057,I am studying to be a teacher and I found every single word useful and clear. Thus concepts are well explained. Thank you for this course,5
97058,"This was a good introduction that bought in some new and previously visited concepts. I did find the course a little 'bitty' compared to other courses I have completed through Coursera, and the assignments were not very clearly structured.That said I would recommend it to anyone looking for a solid introduction to this area.",3
97059,It‘s very hard to me. But it's very important for me. I can learn more about understand my student from this course. Thank you !,5
97060,"This course was very boring and very frustrating. Long long slow lectures with lots, and lots, and lots of questions, and no answers. The briefest of comments on potentially interesting people or topics, but no links to enable those to be followed up. Quizzes on concepts not covered in the material. Conflicting descriptions of assessment requirements. Discussion moderators who continually referred you back to the course material which did not contain the information that people were looking for. Before taking this course I could find only one negative review, which I dismissed as probably being a minority. Having taken the course, I agree with that review wholeheartedly. I did learn a couple of things, despite everything, but I would not recommend this course. Please upgrade it substantially.",1
97061,An awesome course.,5
97062,The introduction was good enough to get me to enroll for the whole specialisation. Which takes some doing!,5
97063,Thanks for this introduction course to give me a new opinions on teaching and learning.,5
97064,"What a fabulous course. The lectures are simple, yet full of golden information. The layout is easy to comprehend and all of the assignments help develop you as a teacher. I'll even go through it at again as a refresher!",5
97065,"The techniques are useful, but a course is a bit boring",4
97066,These courses are packed full of very useful information! I love this series!,5
97067,"The content in this course is a very good introduction to educational theory and practice.There is just one aspect I philosophically disagree with, yet this is a pivotal point in education. The course assumes that Education is a way to change behaviour (as an external factor)Yet I am more inclined to the philosophy of: Education is to lift man up from the animal state; and by this uplift man will change his own relationship with the world (internal factor).The theory and practice given in this course are still valuable though, regardless of this difference in viewpoint.",4
97068,This is a great course for anyone who is already involved in teaching and training or wants to learn about it.,5
97069,"This was really disappointing.There is almost no connection between the experience of the lectures (and that's all the videos are - lectures that track a PowerPoint presentation) and the assignments, quizzes, etc. Reference and source materials are frequently mentioned in passing, but there is no comprehensive list of works cited anywhere. The assignments are often vaguely described and, in more than one case, were described entirely differently in different places.I have nothing good to say about this experience. You're watching a fundamentally disconnected series of mostly ad-hoc discussions of vague concepts. A simple list of books to read would be much more valuable.This is by far the worst MOOC I've taken, from any source, in any discipline. The fact that it actually costs money simply adds to the pain.",1
97070,"Really well put together course, easy to get into, but certainly not to underestimate... the work load of 3-4 hours per week is easily reached, as there's loads of interesting material to go through and the test's at the end are impossible to get through, if you haven't followed the program fully.",4
97071,"The course changed my perception on education and now I do ask questions on why, how and what in relation to teaching. Many a times we remain silent and this is seen as acceptance of the system as it exists.",5
97072,"It´s very focus on primary teaching which is good, but maybe there is a bit too much of theory, I was expecting a bit more of practical resources about how to face a classroom. Good course anyway!",3
97073,I have found this course very interesting and very stimulating. I have been challenged to be a better teacher.,5
97074,"Doctor John MacBeath introduces you in a pretty interesting way to the matters related to the Teaching for Learning specialization, arising a number of relevant subjects to any individual interested on reaching a deeper understanding of his or her learning processes as her or his role in it.",5
97075,"this course is interesting and taught me alot. However, i have finsihed the course and i hope i would be able to attain my certficate as soon as possible or immediately as i need this for my university application",4
97076,This course is highly engaging and I enjoyed learning the Foundations needed to be an effective teacher.,5
97077,This is a fabulous course. John McBeath addresses the heart of the teaching profession.,5
97078,Great material for both new teachers and experienced teachers for reflection on their teaching practice. It focuses on pre-k to secondary school but many of the topics discussed are transferable at all levels. Enjoyed it!,5
97079,Excellent as an introductory course with lots of information to make you think and evaluate your own situation and practice as a teacher at any level.,5
97080,The only course as self development for teachers which eventually shows the right direction to the coming generation to make the world a better place or space to live in.,5
97081,"Very easy to follow, instruction and information presented is valuable and relevant to my profession. I have gained a greater understanding of my role as instructional assistant, and within the realm of teaching, feel an even deeper understanding of the process of learning as it relates to teaching and the profession of teaching in general. Highly recommended course, especially in the series of the Foundation of Teaching for Learning specialization.",5
97082,Tougher than I thought. Excellent information.,4
97083,"Thought provoking and challenging. Excellent for making one reassess what, why and how we interact with students.",5
97084,I hope I'll finish it and get the certificate ^_^,5
97085,It was a great experience.,4
97086,The instructions for writing the essays were confusing. The content was also a bit scattered. It was a little bit dto summize the main points of each lesson.,3
97087,It is wonderful. I really enjoyed it.,5
97088,Very understandable and well explained,5
97089,"Many great thought-provoking concepts of learning theory introduced here. The course is easy to follow, although the the quizzes sometimes contained questions that didn't seem connected to anything discussed in the videos - but I could have missed something, I suppose. I recommend listening at x1.25 speed because the professor has a very ponderous style of speaking.",4
97090,Prepares students for life and the following courses in the specialization,5
97091,Good info but kind of dry,2
97092,"Certainly for self-teachers, disciplined people who want to go the extra step. Really nice contextualizing, not too difficult in terms of time or content but certainly stimulating. Forms a nice basis for continuous improvement and self -reflection for those of use who were not trained to do so in a more formal setting.",4
97093,Its good,5
97094,learnt a lot from this course.. for teachers this is a must course,5
97095,Thanks a lot Coursera! Appreciation Commonwealth Education Trust. Thank you dear Professor John MacBeath and everybody contributing to the development and running this wonderful experience for us.,5
97096,This course is very much benefecial.,5
97097,Relevant information for teachers. This course has caused me to reflect on prior understanding of learning,5
97098,I like the way it is taught!,5
97099,Great class I totally en,4
97100,Finding this course very useful and practical. One criticism is that it takes a sudden leap in the last week expecting that you have a business idea that you a ready to start executing on.,4
97101,"Interesting, gave an unique approach to innovation and creativity.",4
97102,"The content was VERY scarce, and it was obvously prepared in a hurry. This course just touches very superficially the subject to be studied. Not meeting minimum quality standards.",1
97103,In compare with first course of this specialization study materials are too few. Some lectures not longer then 2 !!!! minutes. The whole time of lectures 10-15 minutes,1
97104,I have been looking to get into finance for a long time now but couldnt find something as flexible as this course. The concepts taught here are very simplified and are easy to understand. Overall it has been very fruitful and i am looking forward to complete the specialization.,4
97105,This course has been an amazing experience that broadened my understanding of financial markets! I recommend it to anyone interested in this area and wants to pursue it.,5
97106,"Course content has been very well designed to encompass all the major asset classes and impact of macro economic variables. While all of the topics covered deserve an individual course on itself, but this being a short-term online course, does great justice to the time and fee commitment from students.I would strongly recommend this course to others.Thanks to coursera for designing this course and the respected faculty members for their time and sharing insights into these topics with us.",4
97107,I found this to be a very well put together Course. If I do not offend may I comment on the verbal delivery,5
97108,"I really enjoyed this course. Each unit has many small videos so it is easy to break up. The lecturers attempt to make it interesting (though sometimes they think they're funnier than they are). Regardless, it covers quite a few topics in a way that's very easy to understand. Some of the quizzes do seem to require an advanced calculator, but I was able to use a simple one and kind of estimate.",5
97109,Great course!,5
97110,Accessible for learners with close to zero background.,5
97111,Great learning! The way the proffessor taught is commendable.Even a novice can benefit and learn alot in finance through this course!Thanks to the whole team.,5
97112,Very understandable~~ THX all the lecturers~,5
97113,Awesome course,5
97114,"Good course. However, the language used in this course was a bit tough for a foreigner (non-english speaking participant).",5
97115,Great course!,5
97116,Excellent information in a very informative matter! A person can learn a lot and start thinking differently.Highly recommended!,5
97117,"It's is cool, but some (up to date examples) would be great.",4
97118,Great course!,5
97119,"very useful to help you in understanding how financial markets work , and how they react to number of variables especially Economic and monetary variables",5
97120,Excellent course for those of you who want to succeed and build their own wealthbeing! Professors (pr Michel Girardin in particular) are handsome people who will make you fall in love with financial world,5
97121,It was my first glimpse inside the strange world of making money by being patient. Rushing takes us nowhere. Thank you.,5
97122,Well-taught!,5
97123,Very handy and purposive,5
97124,Very good introduction to the financial markets.Material could be quite ameliorated if scripts were in PDF format.,5
97125,"The course is excellentHowever, I wish that the course is longer; since many things that lecturer teach is so valuable",5
97126,"Outstanding teachers, excellent explanations with real-life examples, making complex topics understandable quite easily. Congratulations",5
97127,First time for me to study MOOC. I learned a lot but there are still concepts I have a hard time grasping.,4
97128,Great course for someone who does not know anything or very little about the financial markets.,5
97129,one of the best courses available for those who are keen to learn and understand how financial markets work.,5
97130,Michel was the best among the others when it came to making me understand and grasp the subjects being taught!!,4
97131,Course was taught by people who gave no indication they had ever bought a security. They read flatly from the teleprompter and rarely looked at their audience. Very disconcerting and not conducive to trusting what is being said.,1
97132,"General knowledge of bond and equity market and its impact by macro economic aspects.East to see that professors are not native English speakers, but was ok.Some lessons, performed by certain professors wear significantly less enjoyable, due to their performance.",4
97133,Learned a lot in this course. Will definitely review it a second time to fully understand all concepts!,5
97134,"a lot of usefull information, presented in an intuitive manner. Thank You!",5

97137,Useful introductioin,4
97138,"The course is nicely paced throughout the four weeks. Love that the videos / content are ""bite-sized"" making it eas to digest admist a busy work schedule. Looking forward to the next course!",5
97139,"I have gained an exceptional understanding of the basic financial markets and the key principles of investment practices. The feedback from UBS professionals, although very short, was quite enlightening and helpful. I am sure ready to continue with this specialization and I will recommend it to many of my friends who are eager to know more about how financial markets work.",5
97140,Great!,5
97141,It is really great,5
97142,"I never kew financial markets were so interesting or so challenging. The video lectures were always a pleasure to watch. I was deeply appreciative of Professor Girardin's affable manner, and his graphic explanation of duration will stay with me for life.",5
97143,"The course offered a good repetition of some major concepts and from time to time I also gained some new insights.For 4 weeks only, however, 70 EUR is rather expensive compared to some other courses offered by Coursera.",4
97144,Excellent summarizing overview of financial markets. Well presented!,5
97145,"Examples that are provided in the course make it easy to understand and to apply in the real world. I have learned a lot about financial markets and theirs relationships with economy. Now, I have better fundamental understanding of investment decisions. It is one of the wonderful learning experiences I have had in Coursera. Thank you for bringing the specialization in more effective ways.",5
97146,Very good course !!!,5
97147,Very useful. The part on valuation could have been a little more detailed. Thanks!,5
97148,Great. It has helped increase my knowledge of financial markets.,5
97149,Great course for those who want to better understand how main financial markets work. Lessons are short but precise and the readings for each module are worth the time.,5
97150,Excellent course and speakers!,5
97151,Excellent. Thank you for an interesting and well presented course.,5
97152,Awesome Course! The Professor uses daily analogies to simplify complex financial concepts and help learners understand the workings of the financial world.,5
97153,"This course is an excellent introduction to financial markets. Everything is explained clearly and concisely. Though it would be nice if foreign exchange markets could also be covered. All in all, excellent course. Thank you!",5
97154,awesome presentationvariety of teacherseasy conversationswhat more do you want ?,5
97155,"A very comprehensive, informative, and engaging course.",5
97156,I am very happy that I took the course and completed it. It was very insightful and the Michel was amazing in his lectures. I look forward to taking few more courses Thank you to all.,5
97157,i recommend this course for every one interested to understand the dynamics of financial markets and the future trends of financial markets and portfolio management,5
97158,"It is very important for every individual to understand the basics of investments. This course is easy to understand and many innovative examples that makes understanding simple, even for a non financial field individual.",5
97159,There is alot of advertisement for UBS in this course.,2
97160,Great course with amazing lecturers and insightful content. The lecture style was fun interactive and really engaged me.,5
97161,Quite informative for beginners.,4
97162,"plain and simple(course content)! I found assignments were very simple , wish increasing in level of difficulty.Modules for reading should be made compulsory.I completed this course in three days.why the hell it needs 4 weeks?There should be serious look at assignments as they are the core part and key measure of understanding and passing should be in terms of questions not percent and there should be increase in number of questions.",4
97163,Very interesting course with good lecturers.,5
97164,"amazing course, great detailing and from the basics.",5
97165,The lecturers is a real deal and the course is so fun and enjoyable.,5

97167,"Great course! Clear, structured and useful. Very nice instructors make it interesting and enjoyable.",5
97168,"Great course, interesting topics, understandable explanations. Highly recommend.",5
97169,I like this course as it is perfect for beginners like me.,5
97170,"Not happy about the course. Very very general information. This can be obtained through any internet reading and doesn't require a purchase of the course. 79 dollars is not peanuts for many countries. The lecturers often refer to the videos which are not part of this course. Examples: PPP valuation has not been part of lectures, but is referred to. Maturity and duration of the bond comparison with the glass of water is referred to, but was not part of the course. For the money - we are getting some shorter version of a bigger course. Not satisfied at all. Just finished all the tests and passed, but not happy. Do not recommend to anyone and surely will not buy the next course.",1
97171,Very informative course,5
97172,Very good indeed from a beginner's perspective. I would recommend it.,4
97173,This course has helped me a lot in deep study regarding the understanding the financial markets.,5
97174,Superb.. This is a perfect course to start with investment management and also a review to the graduates.,4
97175,"I found this course very informative especially after the first week.Great thanks to Mr. Michel who made this course easy to understand, a great teacher indeed.",5
97176,"This was a fantastic course that give the student a good understanding of the concepts in which asset investors use on a daily basis. Michel is in my opinion a world class lecturer in which he explains topics so clearly and in few words. Its very obvious he loves what he does and is very good at it. I would recommend this course to anyone who has an interest in financial markets and plans to take an active role in managing the assets they own; whether it be cash in the bank, the house you live in, your retirement fund or your child's college fund.",5
97177,"It's very informative course, though it suggests that a person who signed up for this possesses/ should possess some basic knowledge in finance. So it takes time to actually understand understanding financial markets. All the rest, it's quite interesting course and rather simple and real-life examples",4
97178,Thoroughly enjoyed the course. Very well thought out and presented in an informative and very engaging manner. Brought to life many subjects I was aware of but lacked in depth understanding.,5
97179,Excellent. Covers a great range of issues and teaches us the basic but pra,5
97180,Great course with good instructors.,5
97181,Excellent! I was very impressed with this course. I am in the industry and found the content relevant and accurate. I also found it easier to learn because the lectures are delivered in video format which I find far easier to learn than reading,5
97182,Excellent course for beginners with small or zero background on Finance. Really passionate teachers and solid course material.,5
97183,Very nicely structured. Great presentations and very easy to understand.,5
97184,"Fantastic course. Videos are clear, informative, have a good mix of theoretical and real-world examples and Michel Girardin (one of the lecturers) has really good, original examples to explain concepts and also keep one entertained (online courses with hours of financial theory can be tough in this regard sometimes!). Also, the video content is interspersed with mini quizzes (generally not graded) which help keep your attention and test learning. Overall very, very pleased - definitely the best online course I've taken in years.",5
97185,not comprehensive enough,3
97186,Beware - will make you upgrade to complete quizzes (and pay) - should definitely be much more upfront about this from the beginning.Seems like very poor tactics on their behalf.,1
97187,useful but boring!,3
97188,"Excellent course!!! I am very very very satisfied with the quality of the faculty - great teachers! - and the overall quality of your staff. Enfin, I feel very glad and gratified with this opportunity. :)",5
97189,This course has increased my knowledge about the economy and especially about emerging markets and bonds. Thank you for this great course!,5
97190,If a person new to finance then its good to refer here.,5
97191,"This course helped me a lot to better understand the financial markets , and the different assets in which we can invest. The presentation was simple and clear in most of the modules. Maybe more examples and detailed description needed in company evaluation especially for students with moderate mathematical background. The module of Bonds needs -in my opinion - reconstruction so that we can read and understand the changes in Bonds' prices we find in the economical websites and newspapers. Anyway, the course is motivating to know more & extend our knowledge. Thanks a lot to all the professors and lecturers who prepared that course. Special thanks to Dr. Michelle and Dr. Ines for their attractive and simple approach. I recommend this course to all interested in investment management either for themselves or for professional purposes.",4
97192,Its a very good and informative course. Especially for people who do not have a financial back ground. The course helps in clearing basic concepts about investments and the financial markets.Thank you!!,5
97193,"Very well delivered, clearly a lot of effort went into it on behalf of the excellent lecturers and the quality production",5
97194,Awesome course,5
97195,Great learning experience!!,5
97196,Great course that taught me the very fundamental conduits on investment,5

97198,Great!,5
97199,it's awesome to be a part of this course,5
97200,Very well structured and the professor are very goo at explaining each and every concept,5
97201,Very good introduction,5
97202,Incredible Course! Thumbs up! Finance is a fundamental aspect of our lives and we would all do well understanding how we can use the markets to improve our future. Thank You very much,5

97207,Comprehensive introductory overview. Lecturers are great!,5
97208,"The evaluation is very confusing. In addition, when graded, it gives different ""correct"" answers overtime the test is presented.",4
97209,Good course but overpriced in comparison to other offerings on Coursera which are more comprehensive and cheaper.,4
97210,Very nicely organized and presented. Thank you!,5
97211,"Well explained, simple brief lectures to understand and yet to detail.Rasul Shaban",4
97212,good course,4
97213,"I enjoyed this course simply because I am new to financial markets. The instructors were able to simplifya subject that I used to find complicated and somewhat intimidating. After learning from these instructors, Financial Markets have actually become a lot of fun for me.",5
97214,"Inconsistent course content, presenters hop between topics, complete lack of definitions, absense of content structure. Moreover, the presentation style is very boring. One thing is for sure - avoid attending finance at university of Geneva by all costs.",1
97215,"This specialization is great! I really enjoyed discovering the basics of financial markets through the internet, it's a (not so) new way of learning, and it was completely adapted to my learning methodology. This way of teaching and transmitting informations is very intuitive, so you don't get all the inconvenient of a normal class. But my opinion might be biased, as I am currently studying Economics at the University of Geneva, and therefore Dr. Girardin Is my teacher every week!It's strange to see your teacher face to face Monday morning, and later on your computer when studying!Can't wait to complete the next ones!",5
97216,Very nice course!,5
97217,Absolutely great course both in terms of content and delivery. A big thank you to the lecturers and course organizers and especially to Michel (loved all his interactive examples)!,5
97218,Amazing course and the information & knowledge about Financial Markets is really great!!,5
97219,It's a good review of concepts for people who already have some financial background knowledge. The professors are very clear in conducting the course in English and have used very innovative demonstrations of examples to illustrate abstract concepts.,5
97220,Superb course! The topics are beautifully explained. Very pragmatic and systematic approach to the issues.,5
97221,is really helpful and useful,5
97222,Excellent course and also very helpful.,5
97223,Covered very practical aspects! THank you so much :),5
97224,"The corse is very well organized. The concepts explained are basic, but foundamental to understand macro-investment decisions and they are explained in a very clear way: every concept is underpinned by a series of example from actual macroeconomic situations, which help to better grasps the theory.Also the balance between the duration of the course and the theory explained is very good.",5
97225,"Very helpful for people who are new to the field. However, I do wish many of the concepts were explained more clearly; often new concepts are introduced and no clear definition is given.",3
97226,the course is easy to understand.,5
97227,very good material as well as way of presenting it . :) :),5
97228,It was a good one for basic learners but there were less explanation on several topics,4
97229,"This course intends to give an overview of the financial markets and the different kinds of investments. All the intructors are great, especially professor Michel, who is the main instructor in this course.Moreover, I considered the tests adequate for learning purposes.",5
97230,Concepts were presented clearly and in an organized fashion. The professors were very nice and relatable. 10/10 would recommend this to a friend,5
97231,I enjoyed the course very much wish here was more interaction with staff though,4
97232,"Very clear on the points he is teaching, and good humor.",4
97233,Easy understanding the basic concept of Financial Market.,4
97234,Great course for kick-starting this well presented Specialization.,5
97235,Very Good.,5
97236,"One of the things that I didn't like is that I couldn't complete the course because, without purchasing the course, I didn't have access to the assignments / quizzes. But the content is good and the Geneva teachers are nice (specially Michel!). Also, some USB guest lectures are not adequate for this type of course, which is for beginners. Sometimes the guest lectures are not even related to the content of the modules where they are presented.",3
97237,I finally understand all the basics about Bonds and Equities and how they react to changes in markets. Great course for all people who are interested in financial markets and their functioning.,5
97238,"The teachers are really great!So far I have studied, I have found that the teachers have worked hard to present the course beautifully and lucidly. Dr. Michel Girardin is just awesome.I liked an earlier course by the University of Geneva (International Organization Management) - which I completed with distinction. I'm enjoying this course very much, as well.I'm not from the finance background, rather from a completely different field - Medicine. These are probably my first true lessons in finance. Really great.By profession, I'm a teacher (junior faculty) and I try to make the classes enjoyable for the medical students here. In this course, my additional gain is to experience the art of teaching - I was amazed by the walking lecture by Dr. Michel Girardin.Thank you very much, respected teachers.Thanks a lot to the University of Geneva and to Coursera.",5
97239,"Great subjects and some great teachers. But every now and then I missed some proper explanations.Further, reverences to articles and books to better understand the subjects were missing as well.",3
97240,"Some very good explanations, especially by Michel Girardin. Some other courses lack explanations.",3
97241,the course could have been enhanced to be more rigorous.,4
97242,"I learn some interesting things. The course gets better for week 3-4. However, the course could use better the Coursera format and strenght.The certified certificate is pricy compared to other courses.In overall it’s good.",3
97243,The course is comprehensive and the instructors have good teaching skills.The level is introductory.I would recommend this course to beginners with limited previous exposure to investment management.,3
97244,"Very thorough and enjoyable. I feel like a learned a lot, and can't wait to complete the other courses for this specialization.",5
97245,This course excellent provides all the basic information which is important and necessary would recommend the course to all the newbies in financial marketsP.S:The professors are AMAZING!,5
97246,"Lively demonstration of concepts and excellent, knowledgeable professors. Would strongly recommend to my friends and family!",5
97247,"Good basic understanding. However the professors can be a bit more professional, sometimes it feels like Im a high school student again, the way they explain things.",3
97248,"First of all, many many thanks for creating such a course and to all Mentors taking time to teach.I wish, however that in some cases the Mentors would slow down and talk in a more comprehensible manner. Especially Guest Lecturers, as sometimes american accent is difficult enough to understand even when talking slowly let alone when going fast.Special thanks to Professor Michel Girardin and Philip Valta for your invaluable and in-depth input.RegardsYevgeny Myronov",4
97249,Best course I had ever,5
97250,Excellent course. The course provides a good understanding of the financial markets and is an excellent introduction to the field of Investment Management.,5
97251,"Very organized. The quizzes in between the videos really help keeping the learner focused and engaged. Lengths of videos are short, which is good for revisiting for a particular topic rather than go through a long video.",5
97252,"The course is excellent, it provides the necessary foundation to understand financial markets which is the starting point for all investors. Some the English enunciation of the instructors is a bit difficult to understand but I got what I needed. Well done.",5
97253,"I am disappointed in the quality of the lectures in this course. They're too summarized -- too quick-- and they lack the thoroughness required to accurately convey the intuition the student needs to comprehend the lessons taught. When I have to spend a significant number of hours watching lectures on YouTube to compensate for the poor quality lectures offered in ""Understand Financial Markets"", I am left wondering why I enrolled in the specialization. I think Coursera needs to have a conversation with the professors at Geneva University about the need for prerequisites before allowing students to enroll in this specialization.",1
97254,"Generally this is a good course. It has a good bit of definitions about markets. As an individual investor I picked up some information on Net Present Value pricing of stock. Now that the courses are not free we have to determine does the cost provide the value for me. I think of the specializations as being one semester of schooling. A general semester last 16 weeks and thus one specialization last 4 months with a capstone project, so about 20 weeks. Total cost of the specialization is roughly equivalent to one semester class at most Colleges. The advantage to the current layout of learning is that it puts the information into a structured timeline. This places time limits on the info which has a tendency to keep me moving toward the goal.",4
97255,The course is fine but the obligation to pay for reviewing quizzies is a mistake if the course expects to get good valuations (in stars) and promotion. There are similar or even better content available in other courses which are truly open and that request for payment if the student wish to get the certificate.Wrong positioning of University of Genève offering this MOOC from an economical point of view. They ask for more than others and will get less.,3
97256,"Excellent programme, there were some mistakes in the translation. For example instead of Yield it is written Year.",5
97257,I thank all who shares in preparation of this great course.,5
97258,"A little too theoretical and the subjects are not easy to follow.It should have more step by step and deep explanation (math stuff).The interest rates vs bonds are difficult for begginers, it should be transmitted in different ways.",3
97259,Excellent work in this putting together this class. Just the right amount of key information presented in a natural way with real life examples and even humor at times.I finally got it how the yield curve works - Thanks!,5
97260,Great job to the team for a very brief yet informative lectures about Financial Management. I really learned and enjoy the videos. A good introductory course for me to study more about Financial Markets. Thank you so much. Maraming Salamat!,5

97262,"A little too basic, but very well explained",4
97263,"just a normal online course, the instructors are just reciting their ppt and prepared materials. Pretty boring.",3
97264,Very useful basic informacion and concepts.,5
97265,It lacks exercises but other than that this course is pretty fun and interesting. I would definitely recommend it.,4
97266,Educative content. Very good for people who want to have a better understanding about the financial markets.,5
97267,"This course is too elementary. U of G is considered to be a top university in the world, I am expecting an advanced course, at least teach us some asset pricing theories, such as APT, thanks.",2
97268,Its a great course.....,5
97269,"This course has really helped me to better understand financial markets, especially bonds market.",5
97270,Well structured course. The graphs used to highlight the key relationships of various variables is insightful.,4
97271,Excellent video series with very good teaching staff.,5
97272,"I like this course very much , it provides us some introduction to the financial market. I completed this course on 15 February 2016. Highly recommended !One the other hand, I feel proud because this is the first batch of this course offering and specifically related to investment management specialization. I'm committed to follow this specialization until completing the capstone project.Thank you very much.Chan",5
97273,"Great lectures,Great Lecturers,Great Guest Talks,Great way to start with the ABC of markets",5
97274,Very and helpful course,5
97275,Very simple and useful,5
97276,Difficulties streaming,3
97277,With pleasure.,5
97278,good for basic knowledge,4
97279,What sets this course apart from any investing course I've taken elsewhere is the focus on international markets not just the the US or Canada. It is an excellent course for those interested in improving their investing returns,5
97280,Thanks a lot!,5
97281,"EXCELLENT!!!MANY MANY HEARTIEST CONGRATULATIONS AND WARM REGARDS TO Dr. Shane Dixon, Dr. Justin Shewell, Jessica Cinco, AND OTHERS! Dr. Shane Dixon MADE THIS WHOLE TESOL (CAPSTONE-1 & 2) COURSE SIMPLY VERY VERY INTERESTING & WORTHY! HE'S SIMPLY INCREDIBLE! MY SPECIAL GOOD WISHES & REGARDS TO THIS VERY SPECIAL PERSON! THANK YOU, ALL!!!",5
97282,"It was a wonderful experience. I have no words to express how delighted I am to finally get this certificate after completing the two parts of the specialization. It is more than a certificate for me. I am from Pakistan and our country does not offer such opportunities. The British Council here doesn't even offer CELTA or DELTA for Pakistan. I went all the way to Malaysia for this. However, my experience there was bitter. So imagine how elated I was when I saw ASU offering a language related course online. It was my biggest desire in 2012 and after waiting so many years I came across this course on coursera and had an opportunity to learn teaching, lesson planning, designing and much more. I thought TEACHER TALK was rubbish and waste of time. This specialization has changed me as a teacher. It has evolved me as a teacher. Thanks, Dr. Shane, Dr. Justin and Ms. Jessica for all of it.Regards,Sassi",5
97283,"This is one of the best course I have done. The high level of teaching, the quality of the material and the structure made this course so good and of higher level than many others done at schools. The ability of the teachers to make every class so especial, made this course more relevant than it seems to be. The techniques taught can be used everywhere.I highly recommend the course for those who wants to become a teacher, not just an english teacher, but a teacher in any course. Better teacher produces better professionals, and this is how a student can get more from one course.",5
97284,I have learned and met a lot people from this course!,5
97285,Thanks a lot for priceless Course :),5
97286,Such a great experience ...,5
97287,"This was great!I express my deepest gratitude to all those who made this course. Shane, Jessica, you became a part of my family! Now my life is going to change, thank to you!",5
97288,It has been a challenging journey. The course is well-designed!,5
97289,"it was a great experience, and it make me personally aware many new things in teaching that makes me better. thank you all for all this effort and hard working to improve us.",5
97290,Great course for teachers! The implementation of this practices makes the teaching process interesting and exciting and as the result students eager to learn English.,5
97291,"It has been a wonderful experience in my life! Thank you, dear teachers.",5
97292,It is very handy for teachers ..,5
97293,great course,5
97294,I really happy to pass my capstone 2 course.. Hurrah I got the specialization....,5
97295,It is a great course thanks our Teachers,5
97296,The Capstone Project 2 was intense and challenging. It's not only the work load that makes it challenging. It is rather the process of reviewing your own work and deciding if it is good enough to be submitted for the final review by somebody from the ASU. It was funny and eye-opening to get back to the videos made six years ago for the previous courses and realize how much I learned since then.,5
97297,I learnt a lot in this course. I thanks Coursera and the teachers from Arizona university for this opportunity .,5
97298,a wonderful experience! thank you!!,5
97299,"The course is a helpful final step that incorporates all previous courses and puts them to use. However, it would be better to assign one micro lesson as homework per week, and make only those who have studied previous courses eligible to the capstone. In this case, week 4 would be less loaded. One more thing I would like to mention refers to mentors' review of the work. I would hope mentors can put in some helpful remarks at a prior stage. This is likely to give guidance to learners so that the final teaching portfolio can be better modified based on such feedback. It has been a wonderful learning journey. Thank you!",4
97300,The whole program is really good! Very accessible! I thought almost too accessible (until I realized that my classes really did get better!). Overall a great way to learn how to put together a substantive ESL program.,5
97301,Excellent course. I learned a lot! Great teachers!,5
97302,Excellent course! Highly recommended.,5
97303,Good course for English teachers.,5

97307,This is one of the best TESOL online courses you can find. I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is thinking about becoming an English teacher.,5
97308,Kind of Confusing but good anyway.,4
97309,I'd recommend this course to anyone who wishes to teach English. I've enjoyed its creativity and the way the professors have taught throughout the entire course. It deserves ten stars not just five. Great job !,5
97310,"This was a very useful course. The teacher is excellent, the materials are well designed and the topic is fascinating. I'm glad I invested my time!",5
97311,Very interesting and I really learned a lot and know exactly how to begin my own startup company.,5
97312,"Fantastic course! Assignments, interviews and lectures are all filled with great information.",5
97313,It was a really insightful course elaborating on each customer funded business model so that you both understand and enjoy learning. The content of this course are highly functional and useful for a startup.,5
97314,"Brilliant course, I got a lot out of this. Covers the main revenue models for customer funding. A great counter to the fashionable way of starting a company (business plan + VC) and a course I'll recommend to those looking to start their own businesses.The assignments were genuinely challenging (not quizzes) which had me out speaking to entrepreneurs about their perspectives - something I honestly wouldn't have done if not encouraged to do by this course.The course does assume that you have at least a rough idea for a business before you start. If you're just vaguely interested in business this will be less relevant for you.",5
97315,Great Course. Very informative.,5
97316,Good one. But do this course if you are already ready with your idea/prototype.,5
97317,Great course. I really liked the professor.,5
97318,Highly recommended for anyone starting or owning a business!,5
97319,That's great! Very useful and non-ordinary course from John Mullins.,5
97320,"Definitely worth taking! Eye opener on lots of issues and topics. I took the course while in the middle of launching my venture. I will definitely put some of what I learned there in motion and certainly keep all in mind before planing my next move.The course rang lots of bells as i already got VCs buying shares in some of my companies. I would have had taken the course before, I would certainly have done things differently.Better late than never!Thanks J Mullins and LBS",4
97321,"Truly inspiring course, very dynamic and with a lot of useful tools as the interviews and the recommended readings. I feel that i learned a bunch out of the course how the VC ecosystem works and some key facts to give a new life or perspective to my business.",5
97322,"Well structured, Interviews bring amazing value added, highly motivational and very professional talk",5
97323,"Very interesting and useful. It was a pleasure to take this course, by professor John Mullins. I read one of his books, ""The Customer-Funded Business"" which bring some valuable insights to topics revealed during this course. The assignments were useful ass well, and support me to better understand the concepts taught during the course. I recommend this course for everyone that want to have a deeper understanding of the Internet business models and some of the necessary entrepreneurial skills.",5
97324,"This is a fabulous course, a must take for aspiring and practicing entrepreneurs. Guides you how to survive and swim along the sharks.",5
97325,Great course with lots of interviews from entrepreneurs and VC professionals. Great insight from real-life cases.,5
97326,classic content and methodology. Inspiring Lect'ures.,5
97327,I really enjoy interview with founders . This course give me lot of insights to founded by venture with customers and involve them as soon as possible. Thanks,4
97328,"I have taken a course about VC, and this course is about not needing VC. It's great to have different opinions, and this course offers an easy-to-understand format which consists of introductions of concepts and interviews from startups and investors. Very good course for moving past theoretical ideas and implementation of solutions in real business situations.",5
97329,"I found this course quite interesting, it made be consider I perspective I previously hadn't. The only drawback is that it is rather slow in places.",4
97330,"Excellent course, easy to understand, all sorts of examples and interviews: from entrepreneurs to VC executives, suppliers, costumers... You will definitely learn something useful here.",5
97331,Thank you for very interesting lectures and inspiring interviews,5
97332,Valuable not only for those who wanna start without VC's,4
97333,"I have done a few courses on entrepreneurship and venture capital, so I was quite curious to see what this course had to offer, taking the opposite approach.And I must say, that it has been the most valuable learning experience so far for me on Coursera. It's really good and it gave me confidence that I'm on the right track, because I will much rather work with my customers than investors, and then bootstrap until I have to money to grow.",5
97334,one of the best courses on entrepreneurship. Changed my orientation regarding start ups and developing businesses.,5
97335,"This Course is currently changing my life , The instructor Professor Mullins is The best, he inspired me a lot",5
97336,"Excelent course, with great interviews. I am sorry I didn't get it 5 years ago. I would have saved hours and hours preparing for a VC, that I would have used to get customers.",5
97337,"A great set of ideas, strategies, and examples on how to grow without Venture Capital. I personally love the interviews with experts and successful entrepreneurs. Plus, it has some of the most interesting homework assignments ever; example: talk to at least five entrepreneurs about their experience with VC. Excellent!",5
97338,Great course! A lot of interesting interviews to important investors and entrepreneurs. Thank you!,5
97339,"A great, practical approach to growing a startup",4
97340,Very useful course for entrepreneurs who don't want to invest their time looking for investors money,5
97341,Very Useful,3
97342,"As a recent MBA graduate, I can only recommend this course. So far the course is based on diverse and interesting interviews to know first hand the opinion and experience of some of the best players of the sector. These interviews are complemented with optional and mandatory readings to allow any student to catch up with the needed knowledge to take advantage of this MOOC.",5
97343,Fantastic course. A must for every entrepreneur.,5
97344,"The lecture / interview approach brings diversity and different views on the table. The topic of the MOOC is actually quite simple, and it's its simplicity that makes it so important - first thought for the large majority of entrepreneurs should be to raise money by their own means, ie building a sellable product and finance the business through customers. The fact that it isn't so nowadays, is the reason for so many failures and it's also why this course is so relevant.",4
97345,"This course is very helpful to all those aspiring entrepreneurs who have an idea but are not sure of sorting the financials out. Thanks a lot to University of London, London Business School and Prof. John Mullins",5

97350,"This is a great course for anyone interested in teaching evolutionary topics in the classroom. The lectures are well organized and are easy to follow, and the assessments are manageable and useful for reinforcing all the material. I particularly liked all the different teaching resources offered or facilitated by this course, as I will likely be incorporating many of them into my lesson plans.",5
97351,Excellent course. Includes both basic and decent portion of advanced information about evolution. I totally recommend this one!,5
97352,"good course, complete in terms of basic knowlegde in evolution, so very good for someone not very familiar with all the details on this subject. However, I was expecting more information on the teaching part, and especially I think most of the lectures on it should have been like the one in week 4.",4
97353,Current and well explained for teachers or anyone wanting to be informed on the topic.Recommended.,5
97354,It was a bit short but it was very clear and with useful information.,4
97355,Very interesting!,5
97356,"Nice course! Be prepared to a lot of reading but it was very fun, specially the written assignment and the resources for teaching evolution. One star out because the certificate has to be bought.",4
97357,"This is a nice short course, but it could be arranged more efficiently. It is a very important cause.",4
97358,Nice course to introduce students into a very interesting topic. The material and information are easy to understand and use not only for the teacher but the students as well.,5
97359,Problems with the Peer-Reviewed activity. Perfect in the rest.,4
97360,"Relies on lots of external reading. The videos and write ups are very interesting, and the course gives lots of great links to further research, which is required to fully understand the large number of things mentioned in the videos.",4

97362,Great Course. I have learned a lot. Regards from Brazil!!,5
97363,"Good overview of evolution. I appreciated the videos discussing how to best teach evolution in the classroom. The instructors assume you have some science knowledge, so if you do not, you may find some vocabulary and topics are not explained as well as they should be.",4

97369,Made me more confident in teaching evolution.,5
97370,"I took this class for general knowledge. As a Teacher Naturalist for years, I wanted the additional education and perspective on new topics (AIDS, TB in Russia, new findings etc). ""Brushing up"" via a class like this was perfect.",5
97371,"Very interesting, love it. Just a constructive criticism: it would be better if the actual content and the ""how to teach it"" could be even more connected. There are several evolution courses out there with different levels of deepness but, as far as I known, is difficult to find courses on ""ok, how to talk about this in class"". You should include things that ""how to avoid the trap of starting discussions with religious people and if you enter one of such, how to deliver the msg without going into a fight... and anti-R.Dawkings approach"". Or another nice topic could be ""how to counter-attack usual/frequent anti-evolution arguments in class"" and so on. I mean... I would like to go beyond the content and be even more ""for educators"". But please, don't get me wrong, the course was awesome.",4
97372,Excellent course with great insights on pedagogic methods and ways to handle this difficult scientific issues in the classroom,5
97373,I love the lecturers' teaching style!,5
97374,This course did what it said it was going to do. I feel more confident in my teaching ability and am walking away with a notebook full of understanding and ways to incorporate my learning into my eighth grade science classroom!

97375,Incredible course! If you are looking for a way to expand your orizons this is the way.,5

97385,"Not bad, but would be better if the course could explain more on the details.",4
97386,"Without a comprehensive background in thermodynamics (which I do not have), advanced mathematics and statistics, this course is extremely hard to impossible to follow. Formulas come out of nowhere and the explanation of the conceptual theory is very thin.",2
97387,Fascinating and inspiring!,4
97388,"The material is very, very good!I am not very confortable with the professor as a lecturer, though. He is very distractig. At the end I opted for just reading the transcripts instead of watching the videos.It is slightly annoying that the References are not properly quoted sometimes.",4
97389,"The course was great, however I think it should be more video content.",2
97390,"this course is a decent introduction and overview from a sociological perspective, of the city. It is well structured, progresses quickly, and begins to contrast the sociological analysis with contemporary theory and critical approaches.",3
97391,"Topic and approach are interesting, however the disturbingly-modulated voice and exaggerated accent of the professor can get a bit unbearable at times and make lectures arduous to follow and enjoy.",3
97392,Excellent course. Lots of information and very fast paced. The instructor is very experienced and knows what he is talking about.,5
97393,Overall a great course to be introduce to music production! The teacher is great and it covers a lot of material in a very short time. I totally recommend it!,5
97394,Great course ! It was very helpful !,5
97395,"This is everything I've ever dreamed ofThis course is all you need to listen to song mixes and be able to replicate everything you hear in a DAW, if you can listen closely enoughHighly recommend",5
97396,Very interesting course.,5
97397,very informative. I really liked this lecture series.,5
97398,"I've just completed the course subject to peer review grading. I must say that this was the WORST online course I've ever taken and I've taken a lot of online courses (including YouTube tutorials by people who were clearly intoxicated when creating their masterpieces).To begin, the recommended software options for screen movies and presentation are awful choices - not to mention ""Prezi"" is subscription service. I didn't use it. Try Open Office which has a ""PowerPoint"" type presentation software if you are looking to save costs. There's also an enormous technical problem with the screen movie makers suggested (at least with the PC versions). You cannot record from your microphone and capture internal sound card information (i.e. sounds produced by your DAW) simultaneously with any of the ""suggested"" programs I tried. The solution was a virtual sound card (I used Voice Meeter) where I could route the sounds accordingly so you could hear the sound produced by my DAW while I spoke. Considering this is a technology course, you would think this would be addressed. It is not.There is almost no practical discussion. There's plenty of ""what,"" --- an overwhelming amount of what actually --- but not much ""how"" or ""why.""Others may experience this course differently depending on your goals. If you record vocals and real instruments and want to learn how to do this so everything sounds fantastic, this isn't the course for you. There's a tiny bit of that discussed with microphone placement and the like, but it quickly moves to digital sound creation. If you want to use synths and effects and noise things and such to create EDM music ... well, this isn't the course for you either, but maybe it would be more beneficial to you than most other categories.So, who is this course for? I can't say I'm sure of the answer to that. If you are wanting to be a sound designer, perhaps you would learn the vocabulary for sound design but not much ""how."" If you use Logix as your DAW, perhaps you will learn where something is you hadn't seen before (although the videos are hard to follow as some things are happening off screen or aren't the focus of the video).In the end, this course was very much a ""self teaching"" course. I didn't learn much from the video lectures provided by Berklee other than application of a few terms in music I'd never considered much with a background in playing instruments rather than playing a digital synth, like ""ADSR."" I spent more time on other websites and YouTube videos and in my DAW's operation manual as we were often told, ""Go to your DAW and figure out how to use an XYZ."" Rarely did it include ""how and why"" to use that XYZ for musicality.The quizzes were awful as well. There's a lot of ""minutia"" detail in the lectures that never seems to have any relevance because there's no practical application discussed. Make sure you know this not very relevant information because it will be on the quiz --- like how to determine the word length and bit depth using some formula involving 2 to the power of something.... it still doesn't make since because I don't know why or how it applies.Also, note that not everything is completely uniform in DAWs with some terms being different in each one. This was extremely confusing because I don't use Logix and the lessons do. I had a terrible time figuring out many things simply because my DAW had another term or button name for it.I'm glad this is over. I feel like I learned a little bit, but don't feel like it's information I'll retain for long since I have no idea how to use much of the information for my purposes. Maybe on a game of Jeopardy?Sorry for the length of this, but I hope you find the information helpful in deciding whether you will benefit from this class.",2
97399,good course!!!,4
97400,Not so practical,3
97401,"This is rich, fully packed with the exact knowledge needed to succeed in music industry.",5
97402,Vey informative,4
97403,"I would like to thank Coursera, Berklee and Mr. Loudon Stearns for this really informative course on the technology of music production. I enjoyed the course a lot and I learned a ton of things about the fundamentals of sound, of the mixing process and on synthesis. Highly recommended!",5
97404,This course is packed with information about the basics of many of the musical elements you need to consider when producing. I think even experts would learn a thing or two from this course because it covers such a wide range of topics.,5
97405,"I feel like there's so much content in this course, but I didn't really learn anything...It's a lot of talking, ending with ""go to the forums and ask your peers about all these concepts that you need to know but that I won't talk about.""",3

97416,"Excellent, very clear and useful. Thank you a lot Loudon.",5
97417,"This is the course to take if you don't know what phantom power is, how attack on a compressor works, or what a high-pass filter does. It gives a solid overview on all the major recording mixing components, and explains why you'd use them, and shows you examples of how.",5
97418,"This is probably one of the best courses I have ever taken. Although time was a limiting factor, a broad range of essential topics was covered thoroughly (given the time), and I really feel that I learnt a lot about hardware, software, sound engineering, and production skills. I also learnt a lot of terminology, which I was finding very confusing during my efforts to teach myself, and feel like I had a good foundation upon which to continue my learning and improve my skills.",5
97419,really awesome!,5
97420,"This course is great! As a beginner interested in music production, this course taught me many basics that I had no opportunity to learn! I gained a basic understanding of music production without paying a single dollar! Thank you cousera and Berklee for offering the opportunity! I recommended this course to my friend and any one interested in music should definitely try this course.",5
97421,This course is amazing since it teaches you a lot of useful techniques that can be used in the most popular DAWs. It totally changes the way you perceive sound.,5

97426,Extremely informative. Definitely going to pay for the certificate,5

97439,It's the most effective course i have followed on line. The simple language get you involved in every single detail of the matter. Will encourage anyone to give a try to this course and the next thing you'll know is that you have increased your knowledge.,4
97440,Great course,5
97441,"Really good organized , great content and easy learning process.",5
97442,"Great material, even though more profundization required.",4
97443,Do like it. Thanks a lot for a good practice-value information,5
97444,"High quality course that challenging, but not too demanding. The course uses relevant cases and really makes you think about strategy implementation.",5
97445,"For me, this is the best of the courses in the Strategic Management & Innovation series. The videos have been kept short and well structured. The lecturer is clear and very composed. The reviews and read ups are purely excellent in driving home practicality of real life scenarios. They give a good understanding of situations companies have found themselves in and specifics applied to weathering storms.An excellent course with excellent delivery. Very applicable to my current job role in coordinating alignment and harmonization of my organisation's group structure.Owolabi, Nigeria",5
97446,The best course I have taken here so far! The teacher really knows how to promote curiosity and enhance knowledge to the students.,5
97447,This was a very good experience for me. The material was easily digestible but at the same time with at lot of depth. I love how the professor invites you to dig into the more academic material without it being a prerequisite,5
97448,Toughest of the 3 in the full coursework. Fun and challenging. You are sure to learn something even if,5
97449,The Professor knows very well how to express the ideas and concepts at the same time he gives real life examples. The course is very well structured and it has a lot of interesting and useful material! Very good one!,5
97450,I enjoyed the content and learned a lot about the many different facets to take into account when implementing a strategy which at first glance may not visible.,5
97451,I found this course very interesting and resourceful.,5
97452,"Very good structured with well prepared materials support. Thank you, Nikolay.",5
97453,Strategy implementation has never been as clear as presented in this course!,5
97454,"This is by far the course I've enjoyed the most - well put together, full of information and ideas to take forward and reflect when implementing any strategic initiatives in an organization.",5
97455,Amazing course! Well worthed!,5
97456,"Excellent course. The innovation theme comes up a lot in lectures and examples, ""as advertised"" in the specialization title. Lectures are nicely chunked, address specific issues and are to the point. Highly recommended!",5
97457,Excellent class. Have enjoyed the whole series.,5
97458,Very good course. But the videos could be condensed in larger and more elaborated movies.,4
97459,Excellent hands on and very practical course. Enjoyed the learning journey,5
97460,Informative course. I learned a lot about business structure.,5
97461,The lecture course is extremely helpful and insightful. Thanks to Coursera for the series.,5
97462,Teacher is a little harder to follow and less coherent than others in the specialisation. Still good.,4
97463,"Dear NicolaiThanks, Excellent JobGiorgi",5
97464,I realy enjoy the course thank you a lot cousera and CBS and specially all the professors,5
97465,"Strategic implementation, something that people generally forget about after creating their ""marvellous"" strategies and then watch them fail. This course teaches us how not to make that mistake.The course was nicely organised, though I believe the rubric for the last peer review assignment could do with a bit of tweaking. Rating on a 1-5 scale for about 10 questions clearly showed central tendency problems, as well as lots of subjectivity in the reviews. I hope it can be improved in the future!",3
97466,"wonderful class, giving me clear picture about 6 aspects of strategy implementation (Goals and metrics; organizational structure; culture; communication; resistance and risks; power and informal networks), also very important analysis with state / substantiate / actions.",4
97467,"Thank you for the clarity in which the aspects and importance of implementation and the pitfalls to be avoided was communicated. The case studies adopted were an eye-opener to various aspects of good implementation - be it culture at Netflix & Pixar, or risk mitigation in Samsung and Uber. Much appreciated.",5
97468,The course is concise but my expectation to learn the implementation of strategy is well established and great!,5
97469,Great course! Definitely my best of the series. Highly detailed with very pointed insights. Slides were also very helpful in ensuring retention of knowledge. Great stuff- bravo!,5
97470,Amazing course with rich content of concepts and tools.It would be perfect if assisted with recommended readings,5
97471,The contents and structure of the course was very good. I enjoyed taking all the sessions.,4
97472,Transversal view about different implementation areas,4
97473,"TL;DR -- Good videos but short and not always relevant material; the course should be titled ""A First Light Introduction to Strategy Implementation""The ""Strategy Implementation"" course is rather a first introduction to the concepts. The material is quite short: only 30 minutes of videos every week and no interviews with ""real-life"" managers.The additional articles to read most relate to blue-chip companies that succeeded: Samsung, Toyota, Netflix, Google, and of course the obligatory Apple mentioned in every Strategy course on the planet. However, it would be much more interesting to discuss failures and/or duller companies.Finally, the final peer-review exercise is a bit broken but that is the case of every MOOC peer-graded approach (cf. https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/hack-higher-education/problems-peer-grading-coursera to know more).On the upside, videos are well edited and clear and easy to understand.",2
97474,Excellent course and teachers!! Congratulations,5
97475,"Material was very good and well structured.I think that one main issue is the assignment. We would need much more info/hard facts to make it much more interesting (i.e. less theoritical).Moreover, assignments are reviewed by people 1/ who did not necessarily went through the 2 previous courses 2/ did not see our previous documents ie for course 1 and 2 3/ did not necessarily understand the question (one person complained because I did not answer the question ""edgy vs. conservative"" => I guess she was misled by the support info which were the same as for the first course).This problem could be avoided by offering a distinct case for each assignment, so that there is no confusion/mis-match.In any case, ""mange tak"" for all your courses. I went through 3 so far, and the ones from CBS are clearly the best I had (videos - content and speed - slides/ support documents, quizzes).",3
97476,Excellent speaker ! Good examples so far !,5
97477,"Very good collection of case studies and articles, in addition to the very well crafted videos.",5
97478,"Great! well-organized the final project, and I loved the fact that we had access to the slides at the end of the lesson. It had great value for me. Were very usefull",5
97479,This is one of the most practical strategy session you will come across. I have read many books and have also gone through webinars and sessions on Coursera but this course by CBS just stands out.This course is best suited for both learners as well as practitioners. I would love to undergo more such courses designed by CBS.,5
97480,This course was very enriching! Excellent!,5
97481,Video quality had some issues.,4
97482,Great Professor and Great Content.Very very insightful.,5
97483,"Shame that the format was changed and the quizzes and assignments were not open. Teaching was as great as the first 2 courses, and slides were useful.",3
97484,"A great course, a practical view of the importance of the implementation of strategies.",5
97485,Nice and pragmatic! Some very interesting real use cases :),4
97486,"The content is outstanding. Very clear instructions and very informative, but it suffers from the ""tragedy of the forums"", if you have any question or is struggling with the content, you are by your own.",4
97487,"Good teacher, objective approach, interesting, informative and enough material.",5
97488,I am thoroughly enjoying the course so far.,5
97489,"A very good insight in the field of terrorism, its deffinition, impact, counter measures, history and future, from the academical point of view. The course is very well organized and I would recommend it to anyone with interest in the field.",5
97490,"What skills did I learn in this course?The history of terrorism, its main causes, several terrorist groups that I did not know and several events that have occurred in past decades that I did not know. I also learned a lot of literature and many literary and academic sources that are based on international research and gave me a broader view of terrorism history, myths, policies and trends. On the other hand I was updated in modus operandi of different groups and statistics that helped me to understand the phenomenon.Excellent course. Many thanks to the teachers, directors, classmates, and all those who have made this course possible. Especially Edwin thanks",5
97491,"This course has been incredibly helpful in making sense of the news and the world today. I especially appreciate the continuing contact and ""office chats"" which help put current events in perspective. Thank you!",5
97492,Interesting compilation,5
97493,"In my opinion, this course is so simple but yet an effective learning tool for those individuals who are a beginners in the field of terrorism and counterterrorism studies. Even though, if it is not your field of study, this course gives you a beginners look on how things actually role in this field and gives you a sense of satisfaction along with deep and clear understanding of this body of knowledge than what the mainstream media shows. This course have given me and think it will for others, an incentive to do something about these issues mentioned in the course.",4
97494,Understand a little more about terrorism as the current conflict,5
97495,"The course is extremely well organized. Theoretical part is presented in a comprehensible way. Mainstream views, their flaws and possible solutions are given, the author always mentions counteragruments and does not try to impose his personal thoughts. Individual tasks allow to get deeper into the studied cases. I also admire external invited partisipants of the lectures, as it provides more diverse perspectives. And last, but not least, it`s great that the course evolves with current agenda.Thank You for this wonderful work!",5
97496,Very usefull concepts and practice knowledge.,5
97497,"An excellent endeavour to highlight how we understand and counter terrorism today. It reinforces Jenkin's perspective that ""Unless we think like a terrorist we are liable to miss the point"". My congratulation to Dr Bakker , his team,and the university. BRAVO..",5
97498,"Interesting and informative, but the material seemed dated. The paper on Jihadi terrorists in Europe is from 2006, and information from the global terrorism database is from 2010, for example. Some of the lecture content also seemed years behind the times -- like the omission of any mention of the increase in terrorist attacks in Western Europe. (Yes, the lecture on foreign fighters was more current.)Maybe it's there somewhere, but all MOOCs should disclose when the lectures were recorded.",3
97499,"An extraordinary course !! with key foundations, historical and current information on the subject, masterfully explained by Mr. Edwin Bakker.A course full of relevant and valuable information to understand the phenomena and changes that are occurring in our world.A course that we should all take to know the role we play in this world so changing and so scourged by wars and misunderstandings.",5
97500,"Fantastic MOOC! This course is great for the ones who want to learn more about Terrorism studies and Terrorism History. It's not a easy one, if you are commited to read all the sugested readings, However it does give you a solid backgorund in this area of study, and it's a nice beggining for the ones, like me, that intend to continue to study Terrorism & Counterterrorism at a University level.",5
97501,Love the class. Very informative. I just wish there were easier ways to prevent terrorism.,5
97502,Best course you can have in the teme!,5
97503,it is a very useful course for the beginners. this course might be improved by adding one week for talking about the empirical literature on terrorism in political science field.,5
97504,"As an International Relations student, I got asked so many times from friends and family to explain what was going on in Syria. It wasn't until this course that I realized I didn't know as much as I thought I did about terrorism. I recommend it to anyone who wants to understand our present day events.",5
97505,This is a truly amazing course! It's hard to believe that I learned more in this free course than my terrorism course for mu undergraduate degree in criminal justice.,5
97506,"Great, in-depth on topic.",4
97507,Very clearly explained course with nice videos and material.,5
97508,Excellent course! Leiden University's courses are great as always!,5
97509,Fascinating and very clear,5
97510,"Great course, thank you!",5
97511,"Interesting course, supported by a good lecturer's team and interesting delivery method.For those who know nothing about Terrism and Counter-terrorism, it is a fast and efficient way to know more about different field of studies, and interesting to understand what are current biases surrounding the notion of Terrorism in our contemporary world.However, the course remains perhaps too generic, and would require more details, especially on crucial topics such as policies (Having examples or working on how to approach policy design may be of great value for the student to understand these challenges, but also for the Leiden University in order to capture inivative approaches.But again, generally speaking, this is an excellent course, with good pace, added value and interactivity.",4
97512,"Very clear lectures, interesting material. Learned a lot.",5
97513,"With a Security and Law Enforcement background, I found this course to be very rewarding. Theories, ideas and trends discussed within the course highlight the issues regarding Terrorism, Counter terrorism and provide further understanding for me in my professional capacities.",5
97514,"I liked very much the course and I would like to get enrolled in others courses related. It helped me a lot to much better develop my work of inter-faith's dialogue and i think important my institution to include the theme of counterterrorism and foreign fighters at our magazine as prevention to avoid conflicts and wrong decision by youngers. As christian, to better understand the muslim and islam world to promote peace is fundamental.",5
97515,An interesting course. Could do with a bit of a technical overhaul as it feels a little clunky in terms of access to course materials and technical structure. Overall well presented and excellent content.,3
97516,Well laid out and thought provoking content.,4
97517,Great course.,5
97518,"Very nice course, easy to",5
97519,Need to have more up to date data. Need more guest lecturers.,4
97520,"A very interesting well presented course, that provides a good all rounded insight into terrorism and counter terrorism. which is easy to follow and provides you with a good understanding of todays issues.",5
97521,This class was very informative and gave balance to the sensationalistic reporting of the media. I think the world would be a better place if more people took this course.,5
97522,"I have been very interested in this course since the beginning, and although it has been an additional effort to the language of the language and to have to make it compatible with my working life, I have not thrown the towel and I have put a special effort to finish it. I have learned to approach this problem from a professional perspective thanks to the approach and structure that Professor Bakker has given to this course and has also served me to document extensively as well as to learn to investigate terrorism and counterterrorism. My most sincere congratulations to the professor and to the whole team of the University department.",5
97523,"It's good see an excellent teacher who shows us to look at the terrorism not via his perspective but wants us to use our own. Techniques he is using is also nice and not boring. As a student, i would take this course(and Edwin Bakker if could be possible) if this could be a lesson in my university. I have learned many things and he aroused my interest about the terrorism subject more than ever.",5
97524,Great course. Great teacher. Great modules,5
97525,"This is a very well balanced course, in that it focuses on many different views on the research of terrorism, from many different platforms, both academic and non-academic, from all parts of the world. Even within the scope of academic, it focuses on the study through the sociology, psychological, political science and many other discipline's lenses.It also has a wide variety of activities and assessments, such as the essays, discussions, hang out and multiple-choice questions, which sustain the attention and interest of us students.Another very important plus-point for this course is that it is offered quite frequently, and allows students to suspend 1 session and continue in the following sessions (and the next 3 to 4 sessions are already on display) which allows a very sizeable amount of flexibility and allows us to plan our calendar accordingly.Flexible, interesting, holistic and updated",5
97526,"I really enjoyed and got lots of concrete advantages in taking part in this course, mainly because West Africa where I am living, has been daily targeted by violent extremism ( Mali, Nigeria, Niger, Côte d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso, etc.), and it was great time for me to understand more the origins, consequences and acceptable strategies , plans and measures states, communities and individuals can put in place to reduce the impact of these violent actions on our lives and futures. Huge thanks for have given me chance to access such a wide range of knowledge, skill and practical tips on Terrorism and Counterterrorism. Merci beaucoup!!!",5
97527,Awesome material!,5
97528,This was a very well put together class! It had so much to offer and really brought a major slew of terrorism studies to the forefront.,5
97529,The course is very comprehensive and enlightening. The professor explained all the major points concerning terrorism. I would definitely recommend this course to my colleagues majoring in international affairs because it helps to understand the current state of the world from a different perspective.,5
97530,It´s a great course that makes posible to know about Terrorism and it´s causes,5
97531,"I think it is significant to spread results of academic researches on topics connected with (counter-)terrorism and real facts. At first, it promotes popular myths deflation; secondly, it encourages listeners to create and can conduce new openings. The most insightful lessnos for me was the ones about modern groups in Syria, assumptions on T and CT and also about problems of terrorism definition consensus.It is also sad that there are almost no duscussions on the forum (excluding the first weeks).Thanks to this course lecturer, professor Bakker, for the scope of information and easily understandable English!",5
97532,I really want to recommend this course. It is presented in a clear and didactive way. Encouraging us to open our mind to many aspects of what terrorism is and how todeal with it. I enjoyed every minute of it.,5
97533,"I took this course when ISIS was starting to better understand the current world issues, I ended up learning much more than I expected.",5
97534,Very insightful,5
97535,"Fantastic course, comprehensive and easy to follow. A good introduction to the field.",4
97536,"Useful, interesting and important course of high quality. To recommend!",5
97537,Excellent introduction & exploration in the analysis of terrorism & counterterrorism. The course also provides interesting readings. Recommended!,5
97538,Highly informative and engaging course!,5
97539,Very informative. Highly recommended to everyone! Can`t wait for the updates.,5
97540,"A pretty good course. The last week about foreign fighters didn't seem to flow as well as the other weeks (possibly because it was added later due to recent world developments).The course referenced many scholarly articles and sources, sometimes including those of the professor of the course. There is no shortage of scholarly reading material.However, some of the reading material came from websites that demanded registration after viewing the document the first time. This wasn't often, but there were a few (under 5 throughout the course) quiz questions that referenced these articles.",4
97541,When i started this course i did not know what to expect but as i progress i became very impress with the materials provided and the dept of information available on the subject. Terrorism has now moved from an item on the news to me to an intimate subject worth exploring further. I became intimately connected with this subject and vowed to continue exploring the phenomenon deeper. Thank you very much for the wealth of knowledge presented.Vannie Curwen,5
97542,Interesting course that I thoroughly enjoyed. Would recommend.,5
97543,Great interactive course with a nice approach to difficult topic.,5
97544,"A really good introduction to the course, well explained, good videos, I only wish I could have read the extra materials too. Only one complaint (very minor) - I live in Colombia and found a couple of references to Columbia in the materials. But overall super.",5
97545,An excellent course on terrorism and counter terrorism. would like to recommend to friends.,5
97546,"This was a great course! It's like a big summary of this discipline, because it would take a lot longer to study it in depth. The videos are interesting with some graphics to help us out. There is a transcript for every week and I used it every time. The only negative point would be the style of those transcripts; the way they are presented. The paragraphs are not in line and there's no real sections in the text. It makes it harder to read. Overall, I'm really glad with this couse and I must say the online community was definitely an asset.",4
97547,A good overview on Terrorism issue.,5
97548,"Material was interesting, but mentors/teaching assistants and the course director were non-existent. Hard to get any significant discussions going.",2
97549,"All in all, a very interesting and comprehensive course on terrorism and counterterrorism history, theory, state-of-the-art knowledge and evolution. Please allow me to recommend two publications on ISIS and why it was born: ""Black Flags - The Rise of ISIS"" by Joby Warrick, and ""The Rise of Islamic State"" by Patrick Cockburn"". With kind regards, Enrico Pinna",5
97550,Thank you for this extensive and very accessible overview of the field of terrorism studies. I particularly appreciated the variety of recommended articles and sources.,5
97551,Wonderful course especially for beginners. Very much informative easy to understand. Videos are very interactive and keeps one engaged. Would like to do further courses in this area.,4
97552,"This Course is totally illuminating! Great backgrounder for a knowledge seeker about terrorism like me. It became more significant & engaging because of the great materials & great Facilitator & Professor, Edwin Bakker!",5
97553,it's very wonderful to share this great mooc with academic people like you really i learned more ideas and it gives me a big power to continue this studies thank you .,5
97554,Really impressed and motivated to learn different types of Terrorist Names and organization. It gives me an idea to start think critically and develop mechanism to stop Terrorist in the country. I really appreciate it. ThanksBilu KasandaPapua New Guinea,5
97555,"Interesting course but:1) The transcripts for each week are appalling. Here is a copied and pasted example: ""Separatist groups remained active in almost 90% of decapitation cases where only a third of ideologically ideological organizations such as left wing and right wing organizations. Are damaged by it. And then, in general, in 17% of the cases. So 7% of the cases, decapitation led to the collapse of an organization."" How are those that are hearing impaired meant to understand what the course leader is communicating? It took me so long to understand the transcript that I may as well have listened instead. The subtitles option reads the same as the transcript - not much good for anyone with anything but perfect hearing.2) The estimated timings for each activity are somewhat optimistic. '10 minutes' is the recommended reading time for each week's reading content. Within this reading list are, on average, 8 articles, some of which amount to over 70 pages - if each article is roughly 25-40 pages on average, and there are around 8 articles, how will this reading activity take the student only '10 minutes' to complete?Apart from that, I did really enjoy the course!!",4
97556,"Really enjoyed the material. The videos were simple, especially for a beginner. This is the first course I completed online and the experience was really good. Prof. Bakker is an able instructor and the concepts were well explained. The tests were simple though. Most of them took only one or two attempts to pass. That counts as a positive by the way.",5
97557,"Excellent, timely information from a five star instructor.",5
97558,"Due to the new wave of attacks in Europe, I believe the subject of this course is pretty important. Therefore, it would be great if Prof. Bakker could review some of the lessons given that are out of date.",4
97559,It's a great course to go through,4
97560,"Loved the time I spent studying this course, if I was going to evaluate it on terms of the title sayings ""it's all and more""How is it more? I am already hungry for more :D",5
97561,Hi!I have done this course because I really wanted to get into the topic of terrorism and the history of terrorism. This course has given me great insight and Prof Bakker is excellent at presenting the material and explaining the complex concepts.Thank you for this great course!,5
97562,Very good courses for someone who want to understand the basics ofTerrorism and Counterterrorism. Only thing I would suggest to improve the course will be to be more up date with the latest event on terrorist attack in Europe.,4
97563,"In general good, but not updated - seems from around 2013, so the new developments are not mentioned.",3
97564,Good review of the theory but course is outdated given the number of events in the last 2 years that relate to the information provided in the course -- particularly as it relates to attacks,3
97565,more about the study of terrorism than about terrorism,2
97566,Its excellent practice for the knowledge of counter terrorism.,5
97567,Interesting course,5
97568,This is a wonderful course. I obtained all the knowledge necessary to start working in this field of International Relations.,5
97569,A course that challenges your vision about terrorism and the approaches to counter it,5
97570,The Course is really good. The presentation is intense and clearly structured. I would specifically emphasize the quality of the required and recommended reading lists.,5
97571,Professor Bakker knows his stuff when it comes to terrorism.,5
97572,A lot of information and very well presented. May need some updating to reflect the quickly changing landscape of terrorism. Thanks for a great course!,4
97573,"Great course, very interesting material. I found that the course material did not match the quiz material, though I was not seriously bothered by it. I learnt a lot and will continue to follow the theory of terrorism and the practice of counterterrorism.",4
97574,This is a great course even for non-english speakers,5
97575,"The best online course I have ever had. Lots of information on the subject,engagin, very well presented.Edwin, thank you, well done and I am looking forward for more from you.",5
97576,This course was so interesting. I learnt a lot and enjoyed every part of it.,5
97577,One of the best courses I ever made in my life. The videos gave me the opportunity to write my own notes and help me - with the additional readings - to learn about the main subject.,5
97578,"This excellent, balanced course uses a great combination of concise videos and additional reading. I enrolled hoping to better understand this hot-topic and Prof. Bakker's course was perfect.",5
97579,"Excellent content and nicely delivered. Would have liked some more variation in the delivery - show us videos, problems to solve, more details for example on Munich massacre - detailed deconstruction of the act of terror. Found it difficult with the tests that involved ""check all that apply"".Recommended course.",4
97580,"Edwin Bakker did a great course. If you are interested in (Counter-)Terrorism Studies, enroll.",5
97581,Very interesting course !,5
97582,"Very compelling arguments and facts. I was looking for something to do and always enjoy broadening knowledge.The content was heavy enough to be meaningful, but light enough to be enjoyable. I enjoyed the discussion forums. I will be continuing the series.",5
97583,"Excellent course for understanding studies and policies about terrorism, its origins and the ways for understanding it.Terrorism is not about killing people; it's about fearing people too.Maybe, the course which based on the writes of Mr. Bakker and one of his books could think us a commercial or promotional purposses, but It's a great, really great, course and way for understanding actually world we're living, and an excellent way for naming many things which happen all of us.Information is another fact power will release us from fear.Thanks.",4
97584,"In my opinion, this course is great. I'm doing my MSc in Forensic Psychology and I did this course to learn more about terrorism.The professor does a very good job at keeping the audience interested and he speaks clearly and slowly enough for everybody to understand.For a 7 week course, you get tons of information and, most importantly, it is well organized, going through modules in a systematic and thoughful way. Every week you have about 3 or 4 required readings, which will deepen your knowledge about the subjects addressed during the videos.I would strongly recommend this course to anyone who wants to have someone very knowledgeable guide you through an interesting and current topic. Thumbs up to Coursera as well, everything went perfectly.",5
97585,Great course. Good introduction on a pretty complex subject. Well brought and great articles included!,4
97586,Theoretically the course is very lacking. There is little focus on the scholarly work in the field except perhaps the first few lectures. The content and scope of the course is too small. Overall however the content is good for a very basic introduction and,3
97587,"This is an interesting and well structured course. In addition, the discussions between the students are stimulating.",4
97588,Altogether a useful introduction to an interesting topic -- despite the generalizing approach and the sometimes conservative instead of neutral presentation.,3
97589,Not updated data,3
97590,"Much better than expected. Thank you, professor Edwin Bakker.",5
97591,"Interesting, well thought, broad and deep, a must for anyone interested in the topic.",5
97592,"Great course, really helps get a firm grasp on the concept of defining terrorism in context to regional conflict and sociological climate.",5
97593,A very in-depth skim of the beginning of a new trend in study and how we view another uneasy subject.,5
97594,Really interesting and opened my eyes to understanding the world's perspective on some elements of terrorism,4
97595,"Excellent work by Prof Bekkar. The course is not an easy one, although Prof Bekkar has given a very systematic overview of the subject. I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in National Security.",5
97596,I found this course to be very interesting. In the US you hear many things from our politicians and media but very little of it has to do with actual numbers and statistics. Now understandably some of those numbers have changed since this course was put together but I think the general idea that terrorism is a constantly evolving entity was presented well. Although I had several distractions tugging at me during this course the information presented has motivated me to continue my study in this area. Thank you.,5
97597,"This is a great overview of terrorism and counter-terrorism, and identifies the many flaws due to lack of knowledge policymakers still make in dealing with this phenomena. The rigor of the course is challenging but not impossible. I like that a section on Foreign Fighters has now been added to further enhance the course. I will use this knowledge to apply to another topic I am researching - gang dynamics and gang violence, which I believe shares many similarities. My only criticism is of the final, which I found to ask several questions about some obscure facts and did not truly test for the body of knowledge in my opinion, hence the 4 not 5 stars.",4
97598,"Excellent course, somewhat ruined by discussion forum inappropriateness.",5
97599,"It's a good introduction. Being green in this subject, it really changes my understanding of terrorism.",5
97600,Average. Doesn't really like the Professor's style. He spends too many time trying to explain that he feels really concern about the victims etc. I feel that the content of the class could have been interesting but the organization was messy. Finally it gives the impression that academics know barely anything about the subject. I would have prefer a more historical approach. Overall i've watched all the content but in the future i won't spend much time checking for new Mooc from him. Thanks for the try though,3
97601,This course was very informative and helped to solidify the knowledge that I had coming into the course. I would recommend this course to anyone from novice to expert.,5
97602,Really great overview and introduction to a tricky and ever changing subject!,5
97603,"Good fist MOOC experience. Pity the google hangout wasn't up but never mind. Would prefer more questions in the videos to check I'm listening attentively.Would also like to see a list of all the reading material in one place rather than per lectiure. Then I can go to each web page and save as epub usiing the crhome dotepub extension and copy to my ereader.Anyway you can streamline that kind of admin task would be appreciated. You ought to spruke ways to read the web pages, because reading it on a laptop or even tablet is a bit tedious. Also with the PDFs, some info on saving them as resizable PDFs would be appreciated.Course content was good and I like the coursera front end.Need someway to manage tthe growing library of reading material that accumalates not just with this one course but if you do multiple MOOCs over time,Thank!",4

97606,"Really interesting, reflexions and work with so many différents people on an attractive and complex dom",4
97607,"I would like to give 4.5 but it is not an option. Mainly because the course is good but sometimes Professor Bakker fails to hold my attention, due to lack of fire in his lecturing style. Whilst I know lectures cannot always be exciting , no matter how keen one is on the subject, I feel that some of the more tedious course material would be absorbed better if presented in a less monotone manner.",4
97608,"Excellent, insightful thought provoking course",5
97609,Very Insightful and transforming,4
97610,Very well covered intro into the study of terrorism and counterterrorism. Gives the learner new perspectives and a challenge to research further into the subject. This is a course that should be taken by everyone in a security or governance related field,5

97619,"I am enjoying this course very much, it is informative and very well organized and presented. I highly recommend it to anyone with an internet in the topic as it provides an excellent overview and includes current academic and non academic (mass media, world leaders. etc). perspectives. The video lectures are exciting and I look forward to the time I spend viewing them, the core readings are relevant and there are good suggestions for those wanted to gain a deeper understanding of the material.

97632,"Excellent course. A thorough MOOC that gives more insight in the practice of terrorism and counterterrorism; what works and what doesn't, dividing myth from truth in a political sensitive subject.",5
97633,"It was a great course, i learned the mean aspects about terrorism and counter terrorism. I think the methodology used was essential to have more interest on the topics handled.I recommend it!",5
97634,Well shaped course. I can follow along without getting bored easily. Very useful and insightful into today's issues with terrorism.,5
97635,"I certainly enjoyed taking this course. Professor Bakker couldn`t be nicer and overall amazing, I understood and memorized every single bit of the studies. The reading was very useful as well. Thank you very much!",5
97636,"Really deep, complete. The efforts of the creators can be seen at first view. Congratulations to Dr. Bakker for the clases and the lectures. The best course I've ever had!",5
97637,"Excellent explainations, graphics and methodology to learn",5
97638,Great!,5
97639,"Superb! After six weeks, I've survived and of course enjoyed the readings and lectures. I've learned a lot in this course. Thank you Professor Bakker and team.",5
97640,"It was a good course, however, it seems that the recording was from the earlier course. Which I don't mind, however, some of the comment wasn't relevant, so it was a bit weird.In terms of content and how the course run, it was beyond my expectation. The list of literature provided were quite extesive and strategicaly chosen.I wish there's a whole syllabus that we can access in the beginning of the course to prepare for the assignment.",4
97641,An excellent course for beginners.,5
97642,it was halful,1

97652,"Excellent course, give us a great idea what is the studies about terrorism and show us how many we are far from a scholar research here in Brazil.",4
97653,Amazing teaching and reading files. Having a great time learning.,5
97654,"My opinion about the course is without doubt positive. It is geared to both college-educated people and for those people without previous knowledge course. The course allows different levels of depth; both can be used to acquire general knowledge about terrorism and counterterrorism, to elaborate on specific aspects, because it offers the student a varied and useful bibliography and recommended readings.As far as the platform is concerned, it is very intuitive and easy to handle, even an online course.My feeling has been to meet not only the vastness of the subject, the platform can be part of the course and the ability to communicate through forums with students sharing concerns and seek solutions.It's an easy course to follow although it online because it is well structured and has a good organization.This does not mean that the course is exceeded without hard work, as the estimated 5/6 hours a week of dedication is pretty accurate.It is not the typical course online almost testimonial. You have to work hard if you want to get a good result.So maybe it's the most rewarding thing I have done. From what I have learned and by the possibilities I see this field.It has also been rewarding by Professor Dr. Edwin Baker and his team for their skill and dedication, they have been tremendously didactic. If it were not for them, I would not have been able to finish. And fellow students from all countries, from forums and debates that have exposed enriching opinions. Thanks to all.",5
97655,"A most interesting and insightful course. The quizzes challenge the student, and give opportunity for individual thinking.",5
97656,"Women have lived in the midst of armed conflict in different parts of the world, but each context we have our own truth. This course allows me as leader of women find a clear path to our own resilience.thanks prof. dr. Edwin Bakker, thanks University of Leiden.",5
97657,I've taken this course for a while but prefered to stop as I found it very not academic in terms of ethics and objectivity. It spreads anxiety and takes too much liberty with History.,1
97658,My first course here on Coursera and I am completely satisfied with both the lectures and the professor.,5
97659,Good information but definitely different from that of the law enforcement communities,5
97660,C,5
97661,Absolutely brilliant course. :),5
97662,"A very helpful course, understanding the definition of terrorism, but also understand what are differences between terrorism and counterterrorism and what it takes to prevent them.",5
97663,"I really like the professor, all the material given, and of course the topic. It's a very interesting course and I love that the professor provides names of important authors in the field, books, films and also schools specialized in studies on terrorism and counterterrorism. I started considering counterterrorism as a career path after my Law degree, we will see how the course will go, but so far (week threem, about to start week four) so good!",5
97664,Very good teacher and Theme discussion,5
97665,"While making the case that theory and practice do not much up, more could be said about current practices, both effective, and non-effective.",4
97666,"Very interesting course. I found the reading material sources particularly relevant without exceeding unnecessary in quantity and issues. Professor Edwin Bakker didactic approach is especially suitable to my ideal concept of how a teacher should communicate with his/her audience. Together with Moral Foundations of Politics held by Professor Ian Shapiro, I would rate these two the most attractive and expectations matching courses I've ever come across online.Thanks to Coursera, Leiden University and all the people who makes this miracle of quality online teaching for free ever possible.Stefano",5
97667,Very informative and engaging!,4
97668,Excellent course with absolutely no political bias whatsoever. Very well planned and delivered with excellent insights and well-rounded viewpoints.,5
97669,"Very objective, theoretical and empirical point of view of terrorism. Very clear explanations and very interesting lectures added about the subject. Very recommendable",4
97670,"This is a really interesting course with current information about the state of terrorism and counterterrorism studies today and with an updated module on ISIS and what is happening in Syria at the moment. The history is an important aspect ,so having finished the course I feel I have a good overview of where we are and where we are coming from with an acknowledgement of the future. I wasn't sure that I would finish since one of the quizzes was so tricky but I got through it and learnt to revise well for the final exam. The videos are very well presented by Dr. Bakker and guests and the essential and supplementary readings very pertinent and enlarging.I wish I still had access to those materials as I didn't read everything I would have liked to but know I can at least refer to Perspectives on Terrorism online whenever I want to for current articles.",5
97671,Just for get our opinion.,2
97672,Good course for a general understanding of Terrorism History.,4
97673,"I like this course... very interesting, well structured and nothing boring....",5
97674,It is a great experience and has been developed very efficiently to provide a valuable tool for the insight and education of a very important phenomenon in the global community.,5
97675,"I enjoyed a lot this curse, I learn many things I didn't know before I take it, I bought the book, and really it was helped me a lot. Congratulations for a great job.",5
97676,"Not only very interesting, also very professional! High level education.",5
97677,"This course is by far the most professional, extensive online MOOC course I have ever had the pleasure to take. I look forward to continuing my studies in Terrorism and CT.",5
97678,Excellent course. Organized and with teaching materials of good quality.,5
97679,"When discussed in popular media, terrorism is a topic that is quite sensationalized. In contrast, Professor Bakker offered a very balanced view of terrorism in this course, tackling common perceptions of terrorism and counterterrorism in an organized fashion, and backing up his claims with arguments from both sides as well as hard data collected by scholars in the field.I also like that the course was kept current with added discussion on Syria. The lectures on Syria were a bit less clear and organized than the previous ones, but then again, hindsight is 20/20, and the Syria conflict is a current event.By and large, I liked that Professor Bakker did not ""preach"" his thoughts on terrorism, e.g. making leaps of faith and then expecting us to take unproven assumptions as the basis for a further argument. If I had to make one suggestion on how to improve the course, I would say that the handful of videos by external speakers were not properly contextualized in the course. In particular, I didn't understand why there was a video of a woman from Amnesty International talking about drone strikes and urging political action, since it was not referenced at all by other lectures.",5
97680,A real addition for every student studying something international!,5
97681,Thank you very much for awarding me with a verified certificate of accomplishment. Indeed the course was a wonderful experience.,4
97682,"Fantastic course. Though the message is clear, some statistic numbers are a lot of out date.It's been an eyeopener for me in many ways.",4
97683,awesome course,5
97684,It was very good to learn terrorism from the theory angle and believe the two groups should work closer.,3
97685,"This course, which delves into the minds of the experts, can expand your knowledge into what's really happening, not just the opinions of the media. Further, it goes deep into the 'why' in a world only interested in the 'who' and 'where'.",5
97686,"Well done, well explained, and very interesting assignments",5
97687,One of the best courses in this area.Thanks for this great opportunity.,5
97688,"An extremely informative and well designed course, I had a wonderful experience learning from Prof. dr. Bakker, his team and colleagues and all the guest scholars who gave their valuable time to this course. I think this curse is a shining example of the wonderful novelty of coursera in providing quality education to people literally across the globe!It's been a pleasure doing this course and I recommend it to all my friends interested in this field and look forward to working on many other courses in the future!",5
97689,"I have learned a lot since the very beginning of this course, i found very accurate the content in each module, and i should mention that profesor Bakker is very objective at explaining, and when it comes to sharing his opinions he gives reasonable arguments.",5
97690,This Course made me lear about a very interesing topic.I feel satisfied and happy!,5
97691,The quality and quantity of the material provided are simply outstanding. “Terrorism and Counterterrorism: Comparing Theory and Practice” is first and foremost a well-structured course built upon solid academic standards. I would recommend it even to those who already have knowledge in this field because most certainly there will be something that you did not know.Excellent course!,5
97692,A great overview and introduction to the theory and practice of terrorism and counter-terrorism.,5
97693,"One of the best courses ever. Enjoyed the Structural Architecture of each module, term analysis, supplementary reading material, polls, even transcripts.Thank You very much!",5
97694,Interesting course. Able to achieve more in-depth understand on Terrorism and Co,4
97695,Excellent tutor - leading speakers from the field with a good slant on all angles that we are covering out there today.

97696,Thank you! Prof. & TA's .. Awesome Course to give good Foundation to Understand the Concepts.,5

97698,Awesome course.,5
97699,"This is one of the best course that showcase our most vital in a way most contemporary matters. Hopefully, the people who will take part in this course will have improved their level of humanity and their partial eyes through a inevitable process.",5
97700,"Very helpful for a basic understanding of terrorism and counterterrorism, and a knowledge with the current reseach in this field. A very pleasent experience studying with Prof. Bakker, and looking forward to the next course with Leiden University.",5
97701,Very interesting,5
97702,Very informative. Great Instructor.,5
97703,"I found this course scholarly and informative. The presentation was clear and the arguments carefully researched and well balanced. It changed the way I think about terrorism - responding to anger with anger is counter-productive and doesn't really address the root causes. Thank you Prof. Bakkar for sharing your expertise and insights with a wide audience.Some quotes from or interviews with former 'terrorists', or from members of marginalised groups within Western societies would have given us a perspective from the other side of the debate. Student colleagues may have been able to add this sort of thing.",4
97704,"It is a great theme, but at many points the course focuses on ""who said what"", regarding authors and papers, and emphasizes this type of question throughout all the tests. I think a longer course where these statements and papers could be properly discussed and explained would easily be a 5-star rating. The instructor clearly knows a lot on the subject and the material is top quality.",3
97705,i think that topics like these are really interesting and for me is important that people know and understand what and why is happening this in the world,5
97706,Exceptional and Expository Course. I RECOMMEND THIS FOR POLICY MAKERS,5
97707,Excellent Course Thanks to Pr. Edwin Bakker,5
97708,Very interesting course,5
97709,"Very interesting. May need permanent updates, for instance through short addition video lectures.Course transcripts are really useful, in particular when translated!",4
97710,Informative and well presented.,4
97711,"A lot of reading is needed which, on one hand, is beneficial to the students but on the other can be exhausting as well. Anyway, I had a great time and gain a better perspective on terrorism.",4
97712,It was awesome!,5
97713,Very useful course. Instructor is very good. They way instructor taught is simple & very helpful. Thank you for this friendly course.,5
97714,"I loved the fact that we could achieve the course in our own timings and I obviously love the whole course, the lectures, the videos, I couldn´t feel more satisfied and grateful!",5
97715,Great course !,5
97716,Very smart approach of such a difficult topic. Thank you!,4
97717,"Great course, just one little problem : the ""anglo-saxon"" oriented theories on wich this course is based (nothing about the french scholars and studies, although France knows a lot - and a lot more than US scholars for example - about terrorism and specially jihadist terrorism that we unfortunately know since the middle of 80's. Some names : Gilles Kepel, Olivier Roy, Mathieu Guideres). Some assumptions about history of terrorism are factually wrong too: Narodnaïa Volia was not an anarchist movement, but a nihilist (Tchernytchevsky, Netchaiev) one. Militants came from russian aristocracy and their ideology was based on the education of the peasant people of russia when anarchists thank that the revolution would come from the workers and the new proletarian class. And anarchy came first from France (Proudhon, Fourier, etc…) and moved after to Russia. Finally, the role of PFLP in the history of terrorism is much more important than PLO (new modus operandi - plane high jacking and hostages, collusion with left-wing AND right wing movements) : of course I don't talk there about political influence but about history of terrorism, movements and modus operandi.Check out the great book ""Histoire du terrorism"" - Gilles Ferragu, Paris, 2014.Anyway i enjoy very much this course. Many thanks from a parisian student !!!",4
97718,An extremely interesting course very well presented and organize,5
97719,"Love this couse, love how explain things.The best is that is open all the time and i can go to school, work and then take this course.",5
97720,A very good and thought provoking course.It is a re-run of an archived course and sadly a number of reference materials that had been on the dashboard are not reposted with it. Also there are references to discussion forums that don't exist. If the missing material and content were up to date it would be a strong and complete course.,2
97721,For those of you who want to have a better insight about terrorism and counter-terrorism..Already welcome to all the new fellow students..,5
97722,"Very nice Course, complete information and easy explanation for all the concepts.",5

97729,"i have not seen best web UI than coursera Ui,its awesome.",5
97730,A bit too basic,3
97731,Good course with details on certain topics. It will be better if we could have the slides presented for download for future reference. The amount of time the slides are show at times is insufficient to copy down all the notes.,4
97732,It has nothing to do with widening network. It is completely misleading. This is just a very short course about office etiquette. That's it.I was very much looking forward to this course. Sadly I got very disappointed.,1
97733,learn the basic knowledge of interpersonal communication.awareness of the communicate style may differ with people from diverse culture and various postionsacknowledge the skills in different occasion.,5
97734,"I liked the course very much, but it is brief. I think it will help us more if some topics are explained in detail.",3
97735,"Great course, learned a lot",5
97736,"Great course. My suggestion is to ensure that students develop their feedback, rather than just saying: ""good work"", ""great"", ""nothing to report"". It is a bit frustrating to develop such a large effort and receive this type of feedback just for others to pass the course...",5
97737,I found the process effective and helpful. The fact it connects to earlier courses and lay out the build up of the project over weeks is excellent. Having the final task a compilation of earlier work with executive summary is excellent model. At some stages I felt time pressure given my work duties and I am happy the process made it easier to continue.,5
97738,excelent course to apply the knowledge of the previous courses,5
97739,A very well thought final project where one can apply all the tools but also get the best out of such tools to create valuable analysis with the information found.,5
97740,A well structured course for acquiring the fundamental knowledge on business strategy.,4
97741,The final project gives a deeper insight and understanding of how to apply the strategist's toolkits in creating valuable competitive position for an organization. Great Professors,4

I enjoyed every minute of the course and recommend others to do the same:) he knowledge being delivered here is of paramount value not only to those teaching English but also to any teacher of any subject.

97791,"Appreciate this course a lot, it was crisp and to the point. Major focus was on using Design Thinking tool.The only downside was the lack of reference material. Course should include the slides that were presented in the video as well as some additional reading material (available for free)",3

97809,good course for developers who think to launch their product in creative manner,4
97810,Wonderful Course! There was information and thinking that I could apply to not only my job but my life too!,5
97811,Good course for beginners in design thinking / collective intelligence methods. Very good and enjoyable videos,4

97817,Excellent course! It gave me the opportunity to rethink,5
97818,Awesome course by ProfJeanne M. LiedtkaonDesign Thinking !!!,5
97819,"Interesting course, but the evaluation process should be reworked with weekly quizz to ensure that the main concepts have been understood and a different final exam which does not assume that you already had the opportunity to apply and reflect upon what you have learned",3
97820,Great!,5
97821,"Excellent, fresh content. I've taken many courses on design thinking, but this one was unique in its tone and approach. It speaks to the executive audience in a way other materials have not, which I appreciated.",5
97822,Great!!!,5
97823,"This course was incredibly interesting and opened my mind to thinking about life and problems differently! But the lectures were very conceptual and I felt myself waiting for the professor to go deeper into detail on the tools themselves and applying them to real world applications. A class that I can point to as a great example of this is the ""Agile Meets Design Thinking"" course from Darden.",4
97824,This course was extremely helpful in getting the perspective and live examples of Design thinking!,5
97825,Great course to support Design Thinking concepts and tools!,5
97826,I would like to have more participation on the forums,4
97827,Just great!,5
97828,Loved the coursework and the examples used to illustrate the use of Design Thinking tools.,5
97829,"Design Thinking for Business innovation is a new concept to me, Its a wonderful insight on how to do innovation using tools and techniques of the DT course, Jeanne Liedtka is just great. thanks",5

97831,"Really enjoyed this course. It had a management stance, which for me as a product designer was insightful. Clearly presented.",4
97832,This course provided an engaging introduction to Design Thinking along with its practical application and interesting use cases.,5
97833,The course give you a good idea about what design thinking is and shows some interesting cases. In my opinion the course is sometimes too academic. It would be better if were more practical,4
97834,Great course!,5
97835,Good insights and tells a lot about mindset change.,5
97836,Scientific and detailed approach to Design Thinking for Innovation.,5
97837,"The topic is really good, but the course does not cover the tools or methodology detailed enough. It is too high level and not many examples or assignments.",2
97838,The course is made for managers who want to get on the innovation wagon.,3
97839,Nice course! Great approach to the methodology.,4
97840,"I think the professor was great. I did not like that the whole course evaluation was in just the five last days with a pair review, it should have quizes form the beginning, that help you grasp the concepts in a better way. Quizes might be related to how to act in hypothetical situations...",4
97841,Self Assessment. I am sure you will be another executive after taking this course,5
97842,"Really helped me to gain another perspective on different solutions and how thinking out of the box, and even in the box but from another perspective may be very productive and innovative.",5
97843,I think its a straightforward course thus being effective. It talks about the mindshift needed and the tools available. It also brings several good examples. I also like Professor Liedtka enthusiasm and holistic vision.,5
97844,Great Course,4
97845,I enjoyed learning about the several Design Thinking tools with practical examples for each of them. Breaking down the design process into the four 'What' stages changed my perception towards how to approach problem solving in the industry. I believe the lessons I learned in this course will be helpful in my career.,5
97846,"The content is very interesting and I learned a lot about Design Thinking. However, the lecturer sounds like she's reading the text, which sometimes makes it hard to focus on what she's saying.",3
97847,The lecture videos move very fast at times but the information is concise and useful. The professor uses lots of examples to illustrate each of the topics covered and helps facilitate the students in adapting the concepts into their own lives and experiences.,5
97848,"Final assignment is targeted at people who have the power and authority to make large decisions or try these methods on projects, which may not always be the case. Otherwise excellent materials and good video lectures. Found the information very useful, and I actively recommend this course to others.",4
97849,It was useful to apply concept on daily basis,4

97853,"it was very good course, the content very rich and well explained.",5
97854,"A great beginner course in the world of design thinking. One note of caution is that it underplays the concept of ""wicked problems"" and newly minted students are in for a rude shock if they tried these techniques in such situations. Consider this course your first guitar lesson, and like learning to play guitar, you will need a lot more practice to be proficient...",4
97855,This course is very helpful in finding new ways how to be more creative and would give you a new perspective in thinking innovatively.,5
97856,Added a new perspective to my MBA thinking!,5
97857,this course helps me a lot. i gain so much information and knowledge in terms of design thinking. thank you for this wonderful and helpful course,5
97858,"The course Material its great, its very clear and complete. There should be more practical lessons that complement the theory, you may get a bit more experience with small practice exercises that ilustrate the concepts taught in the course",4
97859,"Awesome course, definitely recommend!",5
97860,An excellent introduction to design thinking. The stories are great and the tools explained in the course are useful in many sectors of business,5

97862,Quite wonderful and impactful course.,5
97863,Very nice and coherent overview of DT approach. I highly recommend committing few hours to this course and gaining valuable insights,5
97864,"Great examples, very dynamic course and you can inmediatly use it in your day to day work",5
97865,"Great introduction, both accessible and technical, to Design Thinking. Thks to all the contributors & teachers!",5
97866,Thank you so much. Great effort. If the videos can be shorter and focus more on the tools that would be great.,4
97867,"Topic is very interesting, however I think that there should be a strong way to share more information from the University to the participants such as readings, more videos and more forums to create a more dynamic and even more interesting environment.",4
97868,Excellent course to take. It changes the way I think about challenges.,5
97869,Its very nice course,5
97870,"Excellent lectures, adequate reference material. Very solid foundation course on design thinking. Only thing to make it better is to add more exercises and additional reference material.",4
97871,As a design manager I should say this course actually opened my eyes to a new world. I hope be able to make good changes in my world by using this knowledge more and more in my life. Thanks to All :),5
97872,Very good! The course could be a bit longer to exploit more examples and tools!,4
97873,Insightful and full of hands on tools and process. Really open minded. Highly recommended,5
97874,"This course is great to get to grips with the design thinking methodology and tools. Down side is that you only get feedback on your work from your peers, not from faculty.",4
97875,The course content and material was very well put together and enabled a well paced learning within the provided duration. However I'd suggest that the assignment gets some more information early on as if it is left too late the time may be limited.,5
97876,Very helpful.,5
97877,Great Course,5
97878,Short and crisp course on design thinking - a good crash course and introduction to a few design thinking innovation tools that can be applied in practice almost immediately after the course is completed. practical but it can do with some more case studies and deliberate discussion questions every week to keep the discussion board focused and engaged,4
97879,"For a self paced, online course this is an excellent beginners course. The lectures are simple and examples given are very apt. I also liked the peer grading enforced as I could learn from them as well.",5
97880,"Could be less generic! The exemples are a little bit abstract, not much hands on or practical.",3
97881,"A great course into a totally new concept. Explains in great depth, the myriad opportunities Design Thinking brings for all of usKudos to the Team of Design Thinking",5
97882,Great Course,5
97883,I would appreciate more practical cases with the detailed methodology that were applied. Also I will love external resources to study and examples of design thinking applied in different types of industries,3
97884,"Excellent course, it is easy to follow and give very clear step by step approach",5
97885,Very nice initiation to design thinking.,5
97886,More clear examples needed to make concepts clear,2
97887,A must-do course for anyone and everyone. Very inspired by this course.,5
97888,I learn so much and how the video lectures are presented really break it down very easy to understand. I find the information very useful to my own entrepreneurship and design thinking processes. I feel ready to try out some of these steps soon.,5
97889,"Very nice course, it requires a bit of practical experience with the tools",4
97890,"The course videos are well made and insightful. Except for the very end there are no quizzes and assignments. This misses out what for me is a vital part of the learning experience, regular feedback and reflection.",3
97891,"Lots of good material.One think that I would suggest is.. a video with main steps of each of the 4 tool.. not a detailed video or steps, but a baseline to follow. maybe with an study case.",4
97892,Very good introduction to design thinking.,5
97893,"really interesting, many tools to keep going with this topic",5
97894,"Design thinking is for everyone, the problem is people haven't realized. Until we have a number of people who understand and are ready to follow design thinking processes, it would be waste of a great concept. We all need to use DT in our everyday lives.",4
97895,"Very well made and understandable, with a lot of examples.Really help me learn and I learned a lot from it!",5
97896,The lecture videos are very interesting and informative.,5
97897,Excellent pragmatic take on Design Thinking - a fairly complex subject that was made as easy to understand. Really enjoyed Prof Liedtka - am ready for a more advanced course on this very interesting subject - thank you so much,5
97898,"Great content, very relevant to business problems",5
97899,"Very helpful, very professional staff and content.",4
97900,This course starts quite well but it´s awful at finish,3
97901,Insightful and provides a framework for design thinking - foreground a growth mindset while not neglecting disconfirming facts while experimenting!,5
97902,very good course. nice insights,5
97903,"I audited this course. The videos are in fact useful. However, it would appear that the real interaction is reserved for the later weeks of the course. Thus moving from theory to application can be a bit abstract. Of course I did purchase the book and workbook created by the author and have found them to have additional material to support application.",3
97904,"Although I did the free version, I have to say that it is a super easy, well laid out introduction to design thinking... Makes you buy lots of books and go in to researching the tools though :-)Thanks! I will definitely come back for certification...",5
97905,Very well done and extremely inspiring!,5
97906,A very well laid out structured learning program. Course pace & content is great & triggers enough thinking during the course assignment. I recommend the course to all those who want to bring in structure to thinking & innovation,5
97907,"I can't say I really enjoyed this 5 week course. The flow itself was more like ""food for thought"" where a bunch of ideas are presented as sort of an intellectual gymnastics exercise with no point really. By week 5 you are just plain bored. The content wasn't concise enough. It could have easily been a 4 week course or even shorter had they not tried to belabor each topic. It all was too high level and never really got down enough to earth. I have done other courses on the same topic which were better put together.",2
97908,"Interesting course with well-organized lectures and graphics. I enjoyed the diversity of case studies, and especially hearing about countries other than the US and organizations other than large corporations with big budgets. The practice grading of the final project was well done and illuminating. It was effective in helping me understand the grading criteria better.It would be helpful if the printouts were 1 slide per page, as on the page the type is small and difficult to read. Small, weekly assignments such as posting a reflection question in the forum could be helpful. One guest presenter spoke too quickly, so I was thankful for the transcript.It would be nice if those auditing the course could also participate in the final assignment w/ peer feedback.",4
97909,very useful :),5
97910,Excellent! Many thanks for this course. Philippe.,5
97911,I'm delighted... Very applicable to the current work environment,5
97912,Great intro to concepts and critical assessment of mainstream business methods.Some of the concepts introduced need more discussion on drawbacks or common abuse by designers.,4
97913,Great course!,5
97914,"This as been one of the most rewarding MOOCs I have taken, and I can't recommend it enough . ‎Professor Jeanne Liedtka totally demystified the design thinking process, and tools, and made it very accessible. Thank you Coursera, thank you ‎Professor Liedtka.",5
97915,"A good introduction into the topic of design thinking.Even thought the participants only will get real understanding of the material when executing them in real life, as with so many topics that are being sought, this course helps you to understand what is special to design thinking. It helped me to distinguish it from e.g. agile/scrum, and be able to work within a design thinking team.",5
97916,I learned a lot about design thinking. All the examples were very clear and useful.,5
97917,"Interesting approach, content & delivery. Sound examples & study material.",4
97918,Best ever!!! I felt in love with this course! Thanks! :),5
97919,This course is basically about watching uninspiring videos. It needs a lot of design thinking itself.I have bought the book however. It is really useful.,1
97920,I am two weeks into the course and really like it. The ideas and concepts mentioned are quite profound. And hope to apply them soon enough in both my personal and professional life.One additional thing which would really like seeing in the course is use of questions just to ascertain our mastery over concepts. Something like the other course which I am taking concurrently -- Think again: How to understand arguments. Where intermediate quizzes ensures that learners are understanding what the intention is followed by 'Share your thoughts' questions to express your views and discuss specific course material with other learners. I feel this mix of quizzes and sharing really helps in learning the course.,4
97921,Excellent introduction to Design Thinking !,5
97922,Very good introduction to design thinking. Provides some useful tools that I have already used in my personal and professional projects and will continue to use in the future. Every video lesson was well done and tied the overall theme into the content well. Highly recommended!,5
97923,I love the way the course was structured and how Professor Liedtka taught the class. She has a lot of knowledge to pass which is so invaluable to today's organizations. This class provided a great intro to design thinking and how we need creativity and a more human centered approach in today's organizations. The only thing I wish we had was supplemental material to download to help enhance the learning experience.,4
97924,I think it's an essential course!,5
97925,Amazing.The trainers are fabulous.,5
97926,I love the way the slides and material is available.The examples of Design Thinking helped me understand more of every step.,5
97927,"It's a great introductory course about design thinking! short-videos, cases and a nice final project. :)",5
97928,"Very interesting course, but a bit short though - it just covers the surface of design thinking and some of its tools (very well done).",4
97929,Can we get Ed Hesse to do some classes!! He was my favorite part in a very interesting series on design thinking,5
97930,The course was well planned. Very easy to follow and with very interesting examples.,5
97931,A very nicely designed course. Would recommend this course for everyone!,4
97932,This course certainly contributees heavily to the creator within you.,5
97933,Great course for beginners!,5
97934,"Excellent course! Thanks to Jeanne, Darden School of Business",5
97935,Absolutely awesome course. Makes you really go back to the drawing board and re-evalate if we are building products the right way with our customers in mind. A must have course for every product developer and entrepreneur.,5
97936,The best. So grateful for this class offering. A must-take course.,5
97937,Great,5
97938,Great course. Learning a new way to problem solve and think in an innovative mindset is something we all need to succeed in this every competitive world.,4
97939,Its a good course for beginners and provides some good insights on how to change the thought,4
97940,"One of the best courses I have ever attended. I am really impressed with the presentation of the content and the creativity of delivering the ideas. I have purchased the book ""GROWTH"" from Amazon, to add on what I've already learned in a deeper manner.Thank you,Thuraya Al Souli",5
97941,Simply great!,4
97942,Very good course that features intersting lecturers that provide you with real insights.,5
97943,"This was, by far, the most useful online course I have taken. The course quality is excellent and the concepts were explained clearly. I highly recommend.",5
97944,Real methods for Design Engineering,5
97945,Great course!,5
97946,Good course... Why don't you bring entire specialization here,5
97947,Great course! Easy to follow and I have learned a lot!,5
97948,I found the course useful as an overview into the process of design thinking. The content was delivered in an engaging manner and the examples and case studies were memorable.,4
97949,Excellent course! I only can recommend it. Jeanne Liedtka has a great way to teach.,5
97950,"Very interesting course, it's perfect for a basic understanding of the design thinking field",5
97951,"Great class, the business examples are very clear a easy to understand.",5
97952,Excellent course for business leaders to get a flavour of this concept with some real-world case studies. I'm actually making it a compulsory course for my management team.Clear presentation style pitched at just the right level with bite sized videos that can be watched offline with the App.Only improvement would be the addition of some quizzes through the course to test understanding.,5
97953,Really enjoyed the course as a refresher and baseline for Design,4
97954,"Filled with real world examples and step-by-step process, Design Thinking for Innovation is an awesome course to get started on Design Thinking. This was specially useful for my upcoming projects so thank you very much!",5
97955,TOP CLASS!! Changed mi mind set,5
97956,"Content is fairly good with weak story line and connection across the various modules. Also the lack of in session quiz modules or weekly quiz module to re-inforce learning is disappointing.It's also possible that i was expecting a lot from a course on design thinking and what it turned out to be was just a scratching of the surface of what the definition of Design Thinking is all about. Having read numerous books on Lean Thinking, Agile development, Minimum Viable Propositions, etc. I was really expecting a solid rigorous approach to the world of design thinking.This course let me down and I just managed to scrape through at the end...almost gave up.",3
97957,"Great course from the beginning to the end. It challenge you, motivates you and become a person with a different sense of (and tools for) innovation.",5
97958,A very compelling and resourceful course. Professor Jeanne M. Liedtka's approach to educating design thinking is rather fascinating.,5
97959,"Very inspiring course, I will definately use it in my work. Money well spent!!",4
97960,Great course!,5
97961,I like this course but I hope also provide free certificate also.,5
97962,"Great course! It gave me some great new viewpoints from which to problem solve. The case studies were relevant and interesting, and the guest speakers were good as well. I wish discussions had been a little more structured - it was kind of a free-for-all which led to a lot of off-topic nonsense to weed through. After the second week, I really stopped checking in because it was too time consuming and that's a little sad. But that would be my only suggestion for improvement.",4
97963,A useful overview of design-thinking concepts with a focus on application.,5
97964,Great content!,5
97965,Could be better! But is good and very useful.,4
97966,An excellent opportunity to learn what Design Thinking is,5
97967,One of the best courses I have taken from Coursera. The professor and the team involved in this course are great. Highly value added content.,5
97968,"So far, this is the best online course I have taken. Prof. Liedtka was engaging, their case studies were all interesting, and the pace was just perfect. From a course designer perspective, this one is tops.",5
97969,Compelling and interesing course mainly oriented to business and/or management students and workers. It's also complementary knowledge for designers (of any kind) who are looking to manage and direct different communication approaches to specific stakeholders groups in order to develop design applications.,5
97970,"Great materials, great learning system! I could get some inspiration and learning, but i thought it was to short.",3
97971,"Interesting course that clearly describes design thinking. Some of the lectures are really excellent, although some did not meet my expectations. My only other problem was that at times I felt more like I was watching an advert for the course creator's book rather than learning about Design Thinking.",4
97972,A very well-done introduction to Design Thinking,3
97973,Good course! The flow of the modules fit perfectly.But I wished they uploaded the lecture slides and the templates for the design thinking process.,4
97974,Great Course! The problems which were discussed were very realistic. I loved how to breakdown each problem and work towards it.,5
97975,"There should have been more knowledge testing as the course progressed. The first week and last week model didn't help me to incorporate the progress, and I grew disillusioned just listening to the video. I even had purchased the professor's book, but found the course differing significantly from the book. Lost interest is it progressed, but completed it.",4
97976,This course is for me because innovation is my concern.,5
97977,A true learning experience. Good for breaking paradigms and think differently plus efficiently,5
97978,Great experience and learned a lot... felling very thankful for the coursera platform.,5
97979,"Very good course, an a very good amendment to the book!Thank you very muchRegardsStefan",5
97980,"Nice Course, right to the point. Good use of some of design tools. Probably will be better if the course has more in depth info and more tools but is really helpful.",4
97981,A good beginning to help structure the thinking process,4
97982,Great ex,5
97983,"The lectures where nice, but the course was too short, the last exam was not quite good. As i have no chance to try out all these techniques at work, I had trouble to remember where I had to use something similar. Was lucky to find one",4
97984,Awsome course involving how to organize and implement innovative ideas into an organization.,4
97985,Short but very powerful course on highly effective thinking techniques targeted at business professionals,4
97986,"Great course, the course apply system thinking for business model design or redesign.",5
97987,excellent course. it is an good tool as a companion for those who bought the books from professor Jeanne Liedtka.,5
97988,The case studies included in this course really hammer home the principles being taught.,5
97989,awesome knowledge!,5
97990,Good Insights..,4
97991,Great course! Helps you understand how to approach product development and strategy!,5
97992,"Best course ever, very hands-ond oriented, practical example applicable to real life business innovation projects.",5
97993,Its best MOOC for Design Thinking!,4
97994,"It's a very good course, I think it can be structured in a better way, also it doesn't explain a lot of innovaation process, rather, it gives you an overview of the tools and best practices. If you're looking for a suplement of your design thinking knowledge this is it.",4
97995,Nice Videos. I think the class should have evaluations ( at least one moment where you could check your theoric knowledge).,4
97996,Great course. Loved it. Wish the team all the very best.,5
97997,Some quizzes and more than one assignment would have been more challenging.,4
97998,"I previously gave this course a 5-star review; however, upon realising that there is no way to access the classroom after receiving the final grade and certificate, I simply can't give it the same excellent review. I have no way of accessing discussions and my final assignment to see any feedback classmates have given. There is also no option to re-take the final assignment, which was peer-graded and I believe I was not properly evaluated by my peers.",3
97999,This course is very applicable to my current role at my corporat,5
98000,"Thanks a lot Jeanne for making available this course on Design Thinking.It was a clear materialisation of the process for exploring opportunities for innovation.i also love the slides with great formalisations of some concepts.Maybe one more thing, it was very useful to have a short overview of previous week at the beginning of a new module. it is coherent with how we manage our MOOC learning behavior, with sometime a lack of time and long periods away from tje course.Joel.",5
98001,Great tools to think outside the box!,5
98002,"Informative, good presentations and examples.",5
98003,"A very interesting course, with lots of good content. I am excited to learn more now about design thinking. The video featuring Dr. Hess was hilarious! I would love to take a course with him!",5
98004,This is a good class to get insights on the creative process and to add tools into your toolbox for developing ideas and how to potentially form a great idea from a challenge by providing a solution.,4
98005,This is a great overview of Design Thinking and how it applies to any business.I would highly recommend that participants read any of the books published by Professor Liedtka as it provides many interesting examples which reinforce the concepts discussed in class.,4
98006,"The course was very informative, well organized and easy to understand and relate to.",5
98007,"Wonderful course! It was very interesting, well conducted, ideas presented in a way that's easy to understand. I definitely recommend it :)",5
98008,A methodological approach that provides both a global overview of Design Thinking and tools to solve real life scenarios with it.,5
98009,"The course is pretty uneventful. I have done some courses from other universities, which are more interactive and fun. But the content is great!",3
98010,Wonderful Course. Got to learn a lot of new and interesting stuff. And interacted with quite a lot of intelligent and enthusiastic learners.,5

98016,Simply great!,5
98017,Great high level view of Design Thinking with excellent case studies.,5
98018,jeanne liedtka is a good teacher.,5
98019,The two teachers taught clearly and the homework is really helpful！,5
98020,Very good structured,4
98021,"Best teachers, they are very responsible for questions.",5

98025,Very interesting course,5
98026,"I really liked this course because it analyzes with balance the data, concepts and instruments of the great problems and challenges of global sustainability. The modular structure with videos, texts, readings, tests, collective tasks is clear, enjoyable and helps to study and re-study the contents. I have worked for several years as a consultant in corporate social responsibility and I manage a multimedia producer expert in the pedagogical design of courses and materials in environmental management. Through the course he learned a more precise reflection on sustainability issues and will soon start a postgraduate university course in Chile on Sustainability Management. This course helped me to make this decision.A final suggestion for the applications of this course is to update the information in the topics for appreciate better the trends . Thank you very much.",5
98027,This is my first time doing an online certificate course from Coursera and I have to say it had been a wonderful and informative experience for me. The lectures were easy to understand and really helped me to change so many of my misconceptions on sustainability and energy. I would like to thank Prof. Jonathan for give such brilliant lectures and sharing his views. I would also like to thank my classmates for their support and also would like to congratulate them on their achievement as well along with best wishes for their future.Thank You Coursera for such an initiative to spread knowledge,5
98028,Introduction to Sustainability has given me greater insight on the world on a sustainable path. Whether we are approaching a J curve or S curve. This course broadens your knowledge and sharpens your mind to be a great thinker when it comes to sustainability. And i'm glad to partake and complete this course.,5
98029,"Really great introduction to the principles of sustainability. A lot of reading was required, more than I expected out of an online course being taken for pleasure, but that being said I enjoyed the content and learning about this topic. Videos combined with the reading made everything very straightforward and easy to understand. My only critique was that some of the test questions were worded in a confusing way and/or didn't provide an explanation as to why one answer was correct vs another, however I understand the challenges of not simply providing the answers to questions given the course format.",4

98072,"Really awesome course! Especially the peer review assignments. They give an overall view of what are the problems being faced by everyone around the world!

98081,"A very comprehensive introduction, well structured and narrated. Video lectures were interesting and easy-to-follow.

98091,"I've been a supporter of environmental sustainability efforts for a long time, however, I lacked training/knowledge (as my undergraduate studies are in Business). Passion is great, but in the real world, you need skills to back up that passion.

98099,Excellent course and material. Really enjoyed this one. Thank you.,5
98100,This is a very detailed course. You need to bring some time 1 or 2 h a week are not enough. But it is very well structured and everything is very well explained.,5
98101,"I like how the lectures are delivered. It is very engaging, and the content has been very useful. Level of details is also good for me.",5
98102,Good course material. I am learning lot of new things.,4
98103,"I am from India, this course was a good opener for me as I am a teacher for special children, yes patience is the world but the interesting part is it makes me want to learn more and the way to teach these special kids and try to create new ideas as to how i can make it happen.",5
98104,"This was a very useful and challenging course for me. I have had the opportunity to learn very interesting concepts such as spiral of inquiry, growth mindset, grit and assessment for learning! Thanks a lot for this course and your effort and passion put into developing it!",5
98105,This is excellent course for teachers,5
98106,This course gave me a lot to ponder. So enlightening!,5

98110,Very good course,4
98111,"Gave me much to think about, presented in a pleasant and easy to accept way, gave me a few ideas worth trying out, and even encouraged me to persist with my plan to involve my school more with its community. Encouragement is always welcome.But why did you use that picture?",5
98112,Thorough and the course lecturers really transmit their interest and passion for the subject which is important in any course. Thoroughly recommend it if you are interested in planning around a subject and seeing the bigger picture.,5
98113,"I thank you so much for creating this course. It has helped me right now and will help me in the future. I can tell you that your video player is very efficient. It streams very well and all teachers that were involved in this program did a very good job with their topics and were able to get it right to the finest points.Thanks again for everybody involved and that has dedicated time to put this online program together.Sincerely,Steve Cardona",5
98114,Really exciting!,5
98115,I like this course and recommend others to take this gives broader ideas and teaching techniques and methods.,5
98116,Very informative and I learned so much. Would recommend to all teachers out there.,5
98117,"There are ideas we are all familiar with in this course. Good ones for a new teacher who may be oblivious but there is little concrete information about what those ideas look like in a class setting. For example, there might be a discussion of leadership or respect but no ideas about what those look like. It's a lot of teacher talk with no substance.",1
98118,Quick course on the foundations to be applied on a daily basis in the classroom. They provide with useful information and videos on how to develop from a beginning teacher. I found the course a bit too quick and not going too in depth with certain topics; but overall quite good.,4
98119,Thank you so much for the most interesting course! I've had real pleasure taking it.,5
98120,"In this course, you can see HOW to start a school year by setting up the rules and practicing with your students at the beginning of a school year. Students would know teachers expectation and act accordingly by the rules, otherwise they would receive punishment. Involve students in setting class rules if possible. I learned a lot from this course.",4
98121,"Very well mounted course.For the majority of the topics explained, focused on techniques, not jut on theory.Good suplemental lectures listed.",5
98122,More programming assignments would have helped understanding the topics covered in the course better.,4
98123,A very useful course! thanks prof.,5
98124,"Itś a geat course, and the teacher shared his knowlege",5
98125,It's worth to learn!,5
98126,"Interessant, but it wasn't organized too well. Some questions referred to topics which came in the next lesson",3
98127,"Too much theories ,I hope the professor add more programming assignment.",3
98128,"Very good course, but could have something practical.",5
98129,great introductory course for IR,5
98130,"The course was great. What I had a real problem with was the lack of response for problems with the Honors programming assignments. I never received any feedback from the TA's and when I submitted to MeTa support, they said the school design the programs so they can't help. I got a Segmentation Fault on Assignment one which I never did get resolved. Because of this, I was unable to get the Honors status.",3
98131,Great!,5
98132,excellent material and great explanations! The main problem here is that quizzes will sometimes cover subjects not introduced until the following week.,3
98133,This course is really great but the programming assignments need to be updated.,4
98134,thanks,5
98135,Great course for those trying to understand how ro analyse and process text data. It has the right amount of tools to help you understand the basics of information retrieval and search engines.,5
98136,Ok. It was a rerun and there wasn't much help in the Forum and there were too few exercises. But it was really interesting.,3
98137,The explanation is detailed and clear. But the missing star is because I hoped the course would have programming assignments using popular language as python.,4
98138,Good survey of techniques,4
98139,A great overview of text retrieval methods. Good coverage of search engines. A longer course will cover search engine better (remember this is a 6 weeker),5
98140,"The videos could not be too longer than they actually are. If this change, could be done, the student or user could have more time to dig into the assignments problems and even read more textbooks related to the main topic.",4
98141,"Excellent ! Well organized, presented with aptitude to detail. Definitely will recommend and take further units in this specialization.Thanks Prof",5
98142,Excellent Introduction to Text Retrieval and Search Engines technologies.,5
98143,much help for deep understanding of TR,5
98144,The course is interesting and you can learn a lot. The professor is very knowledgeable in the area of search engines. However the course goes very early into mathematical details without too much context. The programming assignments are great and I would focus more on them as they really show you how the engine works.,4
98145,"Love the way the professor introduces the concepts, doesn't overwhelm the student!",5
98146,thanks,5
98147,"This is not a class I would normally pursue. I took it as part of the ""Data Mining"" certification. That being said, this class was wonderful. I learned the basics of text retrieval and search engines. I went from knowing nothing, to having a working sense of how search engine algorithms work. It was a challenging course for me, but very much worth the time and effort I put into it. It was like pulling back the curtain on the code behind Google, Netflix, and Amazon searches, and that has made me think of the world in a different way. I am now a human happily collaborating with machine learning systems. Thank you!!",5
98148,Very good course for someone who wants to understand how text retrieval works.,5
98149,This course is complemented with a software and text (not mandatory) and good explanation with diagrams...,5
98150,"Very theoretical and somewhat dry. If you are interested in applied machine learning techniques (for text retrieval and analysis) this is not really the course to take. Gives a solid background though which, in my opinion, every aspiring data analyst needs.",3
98151,Great insights in this course... I learned so much!!,5
98152,"The material is compelling and the lecturer is engaging, but the course is not well prepared. The assessments are not relevant to the material covered and there are no collateral materials (e.g., downloadable slides/handouts) available to assist in learning.",2
98153,It is an excellent trending topic!,5
98154,"I want to bring it to Coursera's attention that this specialization on Conflict Management is poor quality, poor value and hardly any content. Week 1 is only a welcome lecture!! It is a 3-4 week course stretched out to 3 months so that students can be charged money $$$.It should not be a paid specialization. It does not meet Coursera's high standards. Can you please forward this review to the right person?",1
98155,"I recommend this course for its clarity, easiness and accuracy.",5
98156,"Great course, lots of useful information and the practical application is laid out with case studies. Too bad you have to pay to participate in the assignments...",4
98157,"The course is a very nice introduction to the whole specialization. The structure of the course is very well developed, contains quite a number of use cases that give illustrations to conflicts and possible resolutions. The professor(s) of the course invested quite some effort and time to it.",4
98158,Loved it! It really broke down the understanding of conflict in lovely bite sizes. I can't wait to start the 2nd course in the specialization!,5
98159,Great Course Great Instructors,5
98160,Every easy to follow. A gentle start to recognize conflict issues both within yourself and colleagues.,4
98161,Very good course a lot to learn specially with the globalization and working with different cultures is a really with tool for personal and company improvement.,5
98162,I definitely would recommend more essential books and maybe TED Talks as well.Great books on communication were written by William UryGetting to YesGetting to Yes with yourself (essential book)Beyond Reasonhttps://www.amazon.de/Getting-Yes-Yourself-Worthy-Opponents/dp/0062390678/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1479132707&sr=8-6&keywords=William+ury,3
98163,Great intro to conflict resolution.,4
98164,Thank you so much for organizing this course. I learned a lot in a few days and tried to reflect on what I did in the past and tried to analyze the problems in an organization I know here to understand what went wrong and what they could have done otherwise to avoid internal conflicts that led to a high turn over rate. Thanks again for I learned so much.,5
98165,Interesting,4
98166,This course was fun and fits into real world experiences. I was able to use common sense along with the course material. Nalja speaks very clear and easy to follow.,5
98167,Great introductory course. Very useful subject to understand.,5
98168,Nice course. Informative,4
98169,this course changed me a whole lot.,5
98170,So helpful. I learned a lot.,4
98171,"Interesting, bit not worthy of the invested money.",2
98172,Really useful!,5
98173,"its relatively a good course, although i expected the analogy to be more of a conflict manager.s perspective rather than being in the saddle of a party to the conflict. However it still helps in conflict resolution",4
98174,"Very basic, decent information.",3
98175,This course enhanced my understanding in conflicts.,5
98176,A concise and brilliant course,5
98177,"Good, to the point. Quick and easy tools to identify the sources and types of conflict and the tools you can use to successfully resolve conflict.",5
98178,Good course,4
98179,Platitudes and generalizations. The interviews with real people are the only redeeming factor. I wasn't impressed.,2
98180,Is a good course,5
98181,The format of the course is not very engaging. The instructor shows slides with generic statements and then reads them slowly. The case studies are quite artificial and the answers are too obvious. I was expecting more tricks how to apply this in practice.,2
98182,Great course. I appreciate the work that went into it.,4
98183,"I really enjoyed the course. While i loved the case studies, i found the presentations inelegant and not on par with the quiality of the case studies at all. I hope that this can be improved in the future.",4
98184,This course provides a great introduction into conflict management. The assignments really allowed me to reflect on times when I was both successful in dealing with a conflict and when I failed.The only drawback is that the concepts are presented rather linearly.,4
98185,It is good organized and structured. Interviews are very interesting. Business cases too simple. I would recommend to make the first impression of the subject.,4
98186,highly interesting...,4
98187,"It gave the algorithm to address a conflict, professionally. Concepts are common sense, mostly but the combination and how to use them is provided in here.",5
98188,"Great course, but sometime it is boring since the introductor just read materials. Hope this can be improved in the future.",3
98189,"A great course that equips you to manage a conflict filled world with ease, bringing people, organizations and nations together to live and operate in peace, harmony and good understanding for greater achievement.",5
98190,I really enjoyed this course and it has been very beneficial.,5
98191,A must-learn for EVERY individual,5
98192,"I didn't learn a whole lot -perhaps it is because I'm not coming into a professional setting as a newbie anymore? I found a lot of the examples juvenile - 'wearing a robe to the office' or 'stealing things'. I was looking for more substantial examples of idealogical conflict I guess -stuff that is harder to resolve than being a person of integrity and making good decisions. I know this is just module 1, but the content didn't feel valuable for the most part. The assignments were alright.",2
98193,Excellent course and teacher. Congratulations!!,5
98194,Good class to attend to learn about types of conflict.,5
98195,Very good class,4
98196,Great,5
98197,Not very interesting or well-presented.,1
98198,Great course and content,5
98199,This is a joke right?5 minutes long videos with questions after it shall teach me effective?!you guys are ridiculous!,1
98200,"Helpful introduction to conflict resolution. I appreciated having the various categories and causes mapped out. It makes it easier to talk about conflict once you've internalized the terms of the categories: interpersonal/intergroup/intercultural, values/economic/power, etc. Looking forward to the next installment of this course.",4
98201,very good，you will learn what you want .,5
98202,Highly recommended if like me you have professional communication difficulties.,5
98203,Feel too short.,3
98204,Effective but could be more detailed.,3
98205,very good course,5
98206,Great one. i must recommend that everyone has to go through this course. Wonderful one,5
98207,"Great, Thanks",5
98208,Informative but not ideal for anyone not going into business.,3
98209,"The contents are OK, but the unity packages for the course are unaccessible(download speed is about 8kb/s and stops at 30MB, never able to download). Have left comments in the forum, but no one has replied.",3
98210,Nice.Learned a lot.,5
98211,well organized and structured,5

98215,very professional best in web!!,5
98216,"I had a great time learning about measuring brand assets, marketing return on investment, and customer lifetime value. Thank you to Raj, his team, and that darn squash for getting me through it! Highly recommend this course to others looking for a refresher course or a solid intro to Marketing Analytics.",5
98217,I liked this course very much. Best part of this course was assignment.,4
98218,Great Course :),5
98219,Mixing marketing analytics with useful and fruiitful tools to be implemented.,5
98220,"Interesting, and helpful.",3
98221,The course was very helpful and helped me know about Marketing Analytics as an emerging tool for firms to very specifically identify key performance indicators. It was both information and entertainment. No words to express how Raj has helped us all sail through. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to him for the same.,5
98222,It is a very clear and easy to learn course. 100% recommended.,5
98223,Great course to understand the basic elements of Marketing Analytics,5
98224,when you finish the course you won't be able to print out your certificate so don't even waste your time with this bs website. I am beyond pissed rn and I'm reporting this to everyone this a real comment about this course too.,1
98225,"Loved the information provided. Was insightful and also loved the professors teaching behaviorr, technique and enthusiasm.",5
98226,"Goos course, more detail in the exercises good the great.",5
98227,Great course for beginners.,5
98228,Its a must take course for who ever interest in marketing analytics. The lecture and contents are too good.,5
98229,I would like the course to include more data rich assignmnts where students are providded with a complex data rich problem and asked to build analytics model and arrive at decision making process. The data sets could be close to real time situations. This will help them in showcasing their analytical work.Overall I developed good understading about brand architecture and marketing experiments.,5
98230,"The course was very informative and is easy to follow. The professor has a lot of case studies which shows he is a marketing practitioner and shares real/sample cases that help you better understand the concepts taught (not just theoretically). He also supplemented the class with interview/talks with professionals who make use of ROI, Media Attribution and Data collection and they share their advise to students from their own experience. I truly enjoyed this course and learned so much. I have recommended it to my friends who are market research/consumer insight practitioners.",5
98231,"It's a very interesting course. demands study and it has some real life examples that may be really useful. Nevertheless, it could work on more actionable tools for the daily management.",4
98232,Excellent teacher,4
98233,Very engaging professor. Thorough and in-depth. Very enjoyable class.,5
98234,This is one realy heplful courese for marketing analytics.,5

98236,very well structured and executed course,5
98237,"as a novice student, I think that marketing analytics is a valuable entry level course . thank you for offering this wonderful course.",5
98238,"The content is very relevant to understand Marketing Analytics. The course is presented through a good enthusiasm, humour at a good pace.",4
98239,"Lots of valuable information, very well structured & presented.",5
98240,Great course with various aspects of analytics used in marketing,5
98241,"I found this was a well-organized fundamental course, despite my slight disappointment that I wanted to gain more knowledge and concepts on some other analysis methods. If you look for analytics course that focuses more on tool or skill, this is not the one.",4
98242,Great time and learning's i had during this period,5
98243,Very good insights into contemporary business,5
98244,"Well, It was such a pleasure to understand marketing Analytics. It was so customised that i could learn each and every concept rapidly. Thank you so much to professor who made it possible and it was pleasure that the way he teaches and makes you understand each and every concept so easily.",5
98245,great basic work to grow upon,5
98246,"Very interesting, very interactive course. I have learnt a lot of new concepts in marketing analytics and it accentuates my willingness to continue my learning in this area. Thank you for the great content!",4
98247,"This was an excellent course from content to instruction to testing. I would highly recommend this course if you want to truly understand how and why to measure marketing performance. The instructor was fantastic, and I thoroughly enjoyed his banter with cameraman Kyle and his squash challenges.",5
98248,"I would recommend this course to anyone who is looking to learn some high-level methods of assess a business' value, customer value and product value. The course also provided methods of measuring the bottom line contributions of previous, current and planned marketing campaigns; and approaches to A/B test these campaigns. Lastly, I would recommend purchasing the book that professor Raj Venkatesan co-wrote to gain a more complete understanding of Marketing Analytics.",5
98249,"It was a wonderful experience and great insights into the field of marketing analytics. Any amateur who's new to the field of marketing can learn this very easily. Although it's not designed for industry purpose, it provides deeper insights with industry led examples. The course was never boring and I'm ever grateful to Mr. Rajkumar Venkatesan for walking me through this course.A very useful course for one who wants to gain better insights on Marketing Analytics.",5
98250,"This course is really very in depth and is a good mix of solid theory and real world application. I think it's a must for anyone in advertising, sales or marketing.",5
98251,A little be difficult for me.,1
98252,"Course was well structured and well delivered. Just what I needed to refresh get an overview of current issues and practices. I enjoyed Raj's style, and thought the ""squash"" to prepare us for the harder parts, was great. I would gladly take another one of his courses.",5
98253,"Very nicely designed course, I have about 10 years of experience in Marketing Analytics and still found many very useful tools for analysis. The quantitative part (squash time :-) is especially impressive - two thumbs up!",5
98254,Very well defined and good materials!,5
98255,A very good course with an excellent Professor who teaches step by step properly.,5
98256,very Informative Course !,5
98257,"Good intro course to marketing analytics! Professor is a little goofy with his squash, but it's endearing after a bit.",4
98258,Amazing course!,5
98259,"Good theoretical knowledge. The program create awareness about Marketing analytics, The program could be improved with more detailed examples across different industry. It would be logical to have a part 2 where theory is applied for practical learning.",3
98260,Everythibg under one roof. This was really helpful for my job interview,5
98261,This course is very well structured and designed for marketing specialists.,5
98262,Excellent overview class! Highly recommend!,4
98263,"Very useful and practical....just a bit difficult for entry-level learner, For example, M-net model .Dupon",5
98264,Very good information a little confusion with the regression it's like doing algebra but I like the course.,3
98265,Informative and well laid out. Interesting case studies.,5
98266,"Superb co-relation of industry examples with theory. Great balance of math. More importantly, not a bore.",5
98267,Realistic and Practical,5
98268,"i like it so much, i found it helpful,funny and has a lot of information.",5
98269,"It was very interesting, informative and practice applied. I definitly will use it in my market analyses. Thank You Rajkumar Venkatesan for this course",5
98270,"My first course at Coursera, it's wonderful and exactly what I need.",5
98271,While slightly difficult the professor did a fantastic job of adding humor to make the class more engaging. He started with the general principles of the course material to give us a basic understanding and then followed it up with with the reinforcing technical knowledge of the equations. My only complaints are the information comes at you very quickly and when complex requires rewinding several times to understand. Also I wish some of the work was actually linked to some analytic software to get a real feel for what the interaction would be like in real world situations taking the information directly from the dashboard and implementing it into a strategy.,4
98272,I am starting to love this course . Extremely resourceful,5
98273,Amazing course. But buying certificate is not good,5
98274,"Great course, very detailed and informative.A must take for every marketeer.",5
98275,Material could be more detailed.,4
98276,"Simple, clear and add great value to me",5
98277,Excellent !! Precise and implementation oriented.,5
98278,Good Topics and learnt the unkwon,4
98279,I enjoyed the topics studied the assignments were helpful in reviewing the subject of lessons taught.,4
98280,"Very objective, practical, and industry-relevant.",5
98281,The course is well-done and useful. Thanks.,5
98282,"Was good... I would like to see more ""Analytics""",4
98283,This introductory course gives a pretty much clear idea of the basics of marketing analytics. The practical based approach actually works if its taken seriously. Lots of examples covered and the questions are tricky. All in all I have been quite happy with the progress that I have personally made through this course.,5
98284,Very good course on Marketing Analytics. Especially good for someone looking to enter the field of marketing analtytics or for marketing managers who are trying to be more data driven.,5
98285,"This course is very hands-on and detailed, unlike other similar ones I've taken. Prof. Raj does and excellent job combining the ""soft"" (design, branding, communicaiton, etc.) and ""hard"" skills (number crunching, formulas, etc.). You will learn how to back-up your arguments with figures and analyze how your actions impact KIPs in your company",5
98286,Great course,5
98287,It has great content.A good investment of your time.,3
98288,thank you for your fantastic course,5
98289,"One of the best courses that i have taken on Coursera. Challenging, Excellent delivery and awesome faculty. Hats off to his enthusiasm. Would definitely love to take any other course that he brings up in the future. Thank you for the wonderful knowledge that i have gained post completion of this course.",5
98290,"The course fails to clearly explain how to use so many of the formulas that the professor just glides over in class. The quiz was far harder than it should have been, mainly because the professor failed to properly introduce and teach students to use the formulas.",2
98291,Just thank you!,5
98292,Not bad by the now,3
98293,Difficult to follow.,2
98294,The most interesting course out of the first 3.,5
98295,"A lot of talking, I missed some practical tasks / projects to be lead through to practise the subject",2
98296,Thanks,5
98297,"Easily understandable even to those without prior knowledge of finance, but at the same time can also provide new information to those who have already studied finance.",5
98298,Very good course to understand corporate finance..,5
98299,Great One Melbourne and BNY Mellon.,4
98300,pretty good one,5
98301,Very useful and enjoyful course.,5
98302,Great course!,5
98303,"Similarly to the other courses in the specialization, interesting, well structured and very well presented and with content made easy to understand.",5
98304,very interesting in order to understand the firm stratégies.,5
98305,Truly exceptional teaching and an immense amount of study material!,5
98306,"Quite informative about project decision criteria, gathering capital for firm, about mergers and acquisition and at last about risk management.",3
98307,Excellent course. I thought it was very much informative about the subject matter. I need to view the videos a few more times to gain more expertise over the subject matter.,5
98308,"Good course, quite challenging!",5
98309,it was a great experience.,4
98310,This course has a good logical approach.,5
98311,"Outstanding Course! Out of all the finance courses and corporate finance courses I've taken on Coursera, this was the most broad, engaging, and challenging! I learned new concepts that I feel are relevant to dealing with Corporate finance in the real world!",5
98312,"Good explanations of material, instructor and instructions are easy to understand. A lot of focus on state/gov't regulations that could be more condensed.",4
98313,"This course provides a good overview about virtual instruction and online learning for those who are looking to transition from classroom teaching. The topics are broken down into manageable chunks and a few interviews with other people help to add interest. However, when I wanted to go back and reread for clarification, I found the transcript to be poorly edited and at times almost unintelligible. As an example: iNACOL (National Association for Online and Blended Learning) is referred to many times in the video lectures and was transcribed in the text in a number of different ways: ""Ian Nicole"", ""Inacles"" and ""iNickel."" I really wish the people who put this course together has taken the time to read and edit the transcripts of the video lectures. Many sentences were written without punctuation or contained misspelled words. (enrollment was spelled enrolment) Often I just wanted to read it the lecture, not hear the instructor's voice but found the written text to be less than clear. I also wish there had been a way to ask questions regarding the material, but unfortunately, there was not, not that I could find. Finally, some of the questions on the final quiz are confusing. For example, question #5 "" Which two of the following..."" and then in parentheses it says to check all that apply. I hope this feedback helps to point out some of the problems that hinder virtual instruction.",3
98314,"This course lay down a solid foundation for the virtual education specialization, on which you can build a great practice in the field.",4
98315,"A lot of concise and informative materials, a lot of additional resources for each class, a big inspiration for my work and self development!",4
98316,"I thought the introduction to the vocabulary to this form of instruction to be interesting. Although, I did struggle with some of the quizzes and had trouble distinguishing what they were requesting because I felt they needed a glossary of all the terminology. All in all a good course.",4
98317,"The course provides a good basis for understanding online instruction. The videos were informative, though I recommend reading the lecture transcripts first then watching the videos as the video slides were basic and didn't really add to the lecture's organization.",4
98318,"This is a good course for learning about the reasons, rules and methods of virtual instruction but I think some more interactivity and an increase in the number of in video quizzes would help. I also think more screen shots and a greater number of screen changes would improve the experience.",3
98319,You will find extensive information of the subject in this course.,5
98320,"All in all I liked the course, it's easy to comprehend and well structured. Nevertheless, I missed the lecurer, I'd really liked that the lectured didn't read the script but retold it in the camera, it would be more of a face to face communication. Besides, some interviews would be nice.",3
98321,interesting introduction,4
98322,Very well planned. Could have more interaction with teacher.,4
98323,"This was a good course, a little hard to follow at times but very beneficial.",3
98324,"It is ironic that a course about virtual instruction is one of the worst online courses I have taken. The content was good, if a little outdated (hence the two stars vs only one), but the course design and delivery were lacking.The videos were excruciating for visual learners (or really any non-auditory learners). The video for Week 2, Lesson 2, for example, had a single static image on the screen for eleven minutes. Words were added to the image during that time, but all in all there were 26 words of text on the slide. Really?!? ELEVEN MINUTES. 26 WORDS. Give me a transcript or make it an audio file. Don't keep me chained to my laptop watching a static image for ELEVEN MINUTES!The instructor droned and was clearly reading from a script. She did not even use the video to highlight key terms or spotlight key references. Whenever she mentioned a reference I wanted to look at, I had to either hope it was on the course reference page (many of them weren't there) or try to figure out how to spell the author's name based on her pronunciation of it. It was just really, really hard to get through.The tests were also poorly designed. What states do x y or z. Who cares? I don't live in those states. Which online school has this policy? Again who cares? Maybe a question about why states/schools have different approaches or how outcomes differ between states/schools, but memorizing a laundry list of which state or school has which policies and practices is useless and did not advance the learning objectives in any way.",2
98325,"I would have given this course NO stars at all if that option were available!!!The course is designed in contradiction of all the principles it preaches--there are no forums for the students, there is no way you could contact the instructor, the instructor keeps reading badly, stammering like a first-grader, speaks monotonously and there's no interaction whatsoever!Furthermore, there are mistakes in the quizzes and you have to choose blatantly wrong options if you want to get the 100% score!Although the subject matter about Virtual Instruction is pretty interesting and the instructor made it sound like the most boring thing in the world!Many of the links are outdated or not working at all and often the documents she refers to are 10 or more years old. Bear in mind that Virtual Instruction is a fast developing field and the technology as well as the legal framework are changing very fast too.In a nutshell, if this course were not a part of a Specialization track, I would not have paid for it.Unless you want to do the specialization, I wouldn't recommend this course or any by the UC Irvine because all of the lack forums and no channels for communication with the instructors!!!In one word BAD!",1
98326,"Some materials are useful but the teacher has no idea of teaching techniques and good presentation. Very bad choice for the University of Irvin, California to entrust such an interesting course to such an incompetent and feeble instructor. She is reading in a monotonous way and nothing more. Her presentations have no meaning. She does not appear in the video lectures. She can not introduce animated elements. The materials she selected are sometimes and only somehow relevant. The most of the materials have only percentages, and small details on history. A course of poor quality.",1
98327,"This is an excellent introduction to Virtual Instruction. There is a ""goldmine"" of additional resources that provide addition insights and learning if you take advantage of them. Great Learning Tips for various online tools.",5
98328,"A paradox that a course about virtual instruction is the worst course I've done on Coursera. I am on a verge of quitting it. 1. Despite lots of good information, there is no effort to present it in an interesting and engaging way. 2. Virtual educators say that the students should interact with the platform every 3-4 minutes and yet they give you 15 min video to listen to and look at the same picture. 3. No forums available but the notice about forums interrupts all the videos.",1
98329,"No option of completing the course without paying. So why do you call your site FREE online courses? And why do we have to go into the trouble of attending the class and watching the videos, and reading the material without being capable of at least watching our results in assignments?",1
98330,Give clear understanding about virtual teaching.,4
98331,The videos talk about forums but there is no forum. It leaves the impression that the course was designed and then abandoned.,3
98332,"I found much of the content to be interesting and timely. However, I thought the quizzes were poorly written. There was no feedback, so as a learner it was hard to grow from errors. Also, there were many that required more than one answer, if you missed one, you missed entire question. Without feedback, it was difficult to know which one you missed. The week 4 lesson content was a bit dense for an introductory course. It was dry and could've been more global. Last, the large lesson assignment was only graded by peers with no feedback from the instructor.",2
98333,"Although the content is good, the course itself does not reflect in any way what a good asynchronous course should be. Where is the discussion board? How can one communicate with the instructor or with other classmates? Although peer review of an assignment is one aspect of asynchronous and synchronous education, said assignment should also be reviewed by an instructor, especially when said instruction carries so much weight. In addition, I think overall the tests are unfair. I was marked wrong twice for a question that asked my opinion! Also, in the ""check all that apply"" questions, if one misses one of the answers, the whole question is marked wrong. Finally, many of the test questions themselves are irrelevant to the content of the course. One last thing- the course says it's a five week program, but there are only 4 weeks. Something needs to be adjusted.",1
98334,"It is an excellent course, very systematically presented. I am hard of hearing but thanks to the subtitles I managed to follow the course. Thank you for making this course available.",5
98335,"I really enjoyed learning more about satellite communications. I currently studying at the department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, and this course is my first approach so space communication technologies, I am waiting for the next step.",5
98336,Very professinoal and informal. Thank you,5
98337,"Amazing lessons, very understandable, even for a complex matter. You can see clearly a lot of care was taken to produce it. I reeeeally appreciated taking this course and recomend it to everyone. MERCI!!!!!",5
98338,Great course! Really Recommend it!,5
98339,thanks for this best tetorial for telecommunication satellite :),5
98340,Of Course it's really interesting course and i sure it's giving a lot of knowledge. But unfortunately i absolutely can't listening french speech. Thank you for your big work and i hope to finish your course wen it will be in englsh. With best regrads Nik,5
98341,"Very interesting course, very well organized.",5
98342,"If the lecture had been in English, it would have been a lot more understandable. I had to read the subtitles to understand. It was quite good.",3
98343,it is very best course to learn basic things of Satellite communication. I really enjoyed lot. The way syllabus is framed that is awesome. Thank u so much for Coursera and experts from Institut Mines-Telecom.,5
98344,"The course has helped me understand the role of satellite in current communication systems, be it the television, mobile telephones or even the internet, and its possible role in the future. The lectures are basically in French with English subtitles and transcript available. However, it would have been much better if the lectures were in English.With regards to the course structure and content, a good focus on Internet through satellite was placed which is a good thing. However with regards to distribution of content, the last week had maybe too much when compared to other weeks (more than 3hrs of video, other weeks have 1hr or 2hrs). Overall, a good course for beginners who have interest in space and communication.",4
98345,it meet the expectations hope there is a part 2 soon,5
98346,"Some sections were rather basic, lacking insight on some topics. It may be suitable for people with incipient engineering knowledge but for the slightly trained a bit repetitive. Still, the lectures were quite entertaining and the approach taken remarkable didactic.",3
98347,I have gone through week one and nearly half of week two of the course only and found it interesting.,5
98348,Great course for first level into the subject. Hope it will be offered in English next time.,4
98349,It was straightforward and well structured to allow someone with no (technical) background to follow.,4
98350,Great,5
98351,"A nice course for beginners that include basics of communication, satellite segments and services. Please include slides when the course reruns in future and additional study resources for better understanding of concepts.",3
98352,"I signed up for Intro to Satellite Communications to learn about the industry to go along with a new job. The instructors did a fantastic job explaining the material and used a lot of good diagrams and metaphors to help explain complex topics. I felt I learned a great deal about SatCom, Radio Frequency theory, and internet protocol through this course. My only suggestion would be to help those of us who don't have a mathematics background to better understand many of the formulas and equations used in the course, as I struggled to comprehend some of these topics, but understood the general concepts. Other than perhaps ""dumbing down"" or spending more time on the math portion, great course, great professors, and I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is interested in communication.",5
98353,"It is a good course to understand Satellite communication from system engineering point of view.Course content is well arranged to address Commercial aspects of Satellite communication, Application of satellite communication for different services. It also includes expert talk which gives insight in the Satellite communication for career point of view.",4
98354,"The syllabus is well framed, understanding the wide audience, the format and the duration. Wish the course was in English, it would have star rating from me. Thanks!",4
98355,"Well constructed, very good overview material and a great refresher course.",5
98356,It was sometimes repetitive as I knew quite a bit of the course (I'm a student in electrical engineering) but it's an excellent course for someone with no previous knowledge of telecoms and satellite,4
98357,I was very impressed by the course it helped to have a better understanding of Satellite communications. But I was a bit dissapointed about the networking and services it was a bit light. Overall it is a very good course.,5
98358,"I really enjoyed weeks 1 and 2. They were more business focused. Weeks 3 through 6 were super technical. All in all, it was a great primer for satellite communications. Congrats to the team!",3
98359,Very Informative and useful,5
98360,Only if they speak in English,4
98361,"Really enjoyed the pacing, detail of lectures and complexity of assignments. Well crafted course.",5
98362,I think whole course was well explained but sometimes I had a hard time to get a key point in videos.,4
98363,Very well balance course with usable and valuable materials,5
98364,"This is very well designed course, especially for a beginner who has never used Agile methodologies before.",5
98365,I found this course very nice and beneficial to my professional thinking. It make me rethink the way I thought about requirements collection in formal methods.,5
98366,Great course!,5
98367,"Great course! Really well thought, very organized framework, and engaging teaching. It will stretch you and encourage more deliberate thinking and help you better connect with your end-users to then create more valuable solutions for them while meeting business objectives.",5
98368,"Interesting, insightful, well explained, practical.",4
98369,"It is an awesome course, a must have if you want to get the ideea how to develop and plan your software or design ideea.",5
98370,"Practical part is significantly important after theory. I have never enjoyed training before, but this course is excellent.",5
98371,"great course, it gives you the tools to start to build a software product focused on the User",5
98372,"Great, thorough course.",5
98373,"This course was an excellent introduction to Agile, particularly for a 'newbie'. Having heard about Agile I've been interested in learning more and found this course to be exactly what I needed.",5
98374,I really loved this course on agile because it introduces Personas and user stories in enough detail to get started. Needless to say the videos are pleasant to watch and the materials are very comprehensive. I didn't subscribe for the certificate because I won't be applying agile to software design.Great job!,5
98375,This course completely opened my eyes as a team lead. Software development is now very clear.,5
98376,Longer than it should be,3
98377,I only have read books on Agile. This course has been very valuable in the months since I have taken it.,5
98378,"Excellent material, easy to follow lecturing style that kept me engaged in small enough chunks that were easy to fit into what ever spare time I had. I also learned a lot grading peer assignments which was also great.",5
98379,Great introductory course.,5
98380,Very practical and helpful.,5
98381,"Very good course. Excellent material and good coverage of the subject matter. Lecturer does a very good job of presenting the information in a clear, easy to understand manner. Exercises are well thought out and provide practical experience with the material. All and all great course. Can't wait to take the second part of this series.",5
98382,A very good introduction to agile and design thinking. I don't hesitate to recommend this course.,5
98383,"I really enjoyed it, having been a developer for a long time, it was interesting to see how the story card comes together",5
98384,It is good in general.The instructor is thorough and provides lots of information and useful templates. I feel sometimes there are missing links in the explanation. The work load is fair and the exercises are helpful.,4
98385,Good course,5
98386,Fantastic course.Lectures and Assignments are well combined. Learnt a lot!,5
98387,"Awesome course that definitely required some dedication indeed. The quizes were fun because they were challenging ... there should have been a way to randomize the questions better because the questions were awesome but repeated in different tries to improve my scores ... and so, it became easier to correct your mistakes (that's a positive actually).",5
98388,a must have skill set for anyone working on agile environment. solid and structured approach on how to understand a problem and build a user story .,5
98389,Very good explanaitions and way to guide us throught the course,5
98390,"Excellent training, thanks a lot Alex.Your teaching skills are really great and all the materials are really valuable.",5
98391,A should do course!,5
98392,The professor has done a great job unearthing a very deep understanding of Agile. I would recommend this course to anyone who is serious about Agile.,5
98393,"Great course, it explains the basic Agile concepts and clarifies how to create good user stories.",4
98394,I highly recommend it!,5
98395,Great course which is very relevant and helpful from agile practitioner.,5
98396,"This course is great, it has finally given me the language I need to speak to work I have been doing but did not know had this much structure around it!",5
98397,Great explanations of concepts and very helpful skits for the example case study!,5
98398,great course,5
98399,"Great course, great material and tutors.",5
98400,This course is brilliant and the lecturer is a very good speaker.,5
98401,As a beginner in the filed I can say the course was perfect as a start.,5
98402,Really useful and interesting course!It surpassed my expectations by far. The knowledge and understanding of Design Thinking and the simplicity that it was presented and connected with Agile was truly remarkable.Would definitely recommend it.,5
98403,Really impressed with the various techniques and reinforcements applied online instruction.,5
98404,"this course is attending my spectations,and it's helping me to make rigth some concepts I was doing in the worng way",5
98405,"although this is my first time in learning about Design thinking, I'm happy to say that I love the way Coursera put together the specialization.I am really excited about what I have learnt so far, most especially in this first week alone! for instance I got to here about the importance of instrumenting observation at the design and experimentation stage of a product and releasing in small batches as way of achieving expected outcome.I look forward to more opportunities to learn more about Design Thinking under Coursera and her partner institutions.Thank you",5
98406,I thought the course was very informative and a great foundation for the new few courses I plan to take. I only wish there was a better summary after completing each week. Better material to study vs a very long document to review.,4
98407,"Great stuff. This guy explains and illustrates concepts clearly, uses the pedagogical tools intelligently and sweats the presentational details. I'm excited about going deeper into this specialization.",5
98408,"The value of this course exceeded my expectations. The course contains lots of useful, relevant and well-structured information related to Agile practices and Design Thinking. I knew about Agile before taking the course, and had been practicing it for some time in one way or another, but this course has greatly improved my understanding of basic principles of agile and, more importantly, taught me some very specific approaches and methodologies which can be applied to real-life projects.I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in Agile or IT development in general.",5
98409,"The course material is invaluably helpful for anyone looking for a new approach to innovation and provides learners with a ""method"" or path for what often appears as magic or intuition. Assignments are a little bit too easy to complete imo and could be made harder to deepen our understanding and make information stick for the long run.",4
98410,Very informative.Very useful.,5
98411,Loved it! Content is great and form perfect for a deep glimpse into Agile and Design thinking.Thank you!,5
98412,Watching the videos has made taking this unit much easier and more efficient. The material is at the right level of detail and each topic is explained well. Love Coursera also!,5
98413,"This course has given me really valuable methodology to thing about new processes, how it is important for users and for the company overall.",5
98414,Excellent introduction to Agile methods focusing on really understanding the customer through personas and problem statements.,5
98415,"While the content and the curriculum of the course is ok, the course is not moderated enough in terms of answering the questions the participants have",3
98416,"A great course to start. IT bridges between Design Thinking and Agile. I found that very valuable, especially for Product Owners who need to understand what ""Pre-Scrum"" activities are required/helpful in their role, i.e. it doesn't make sense to define what you want before you know what you need.Some of the videos have a bit of lengths, if you're already familiar with the topic. But that might be part of the didactics for beginners.The Quizzes sometimes seem to be a bit 'awkward' - i.e. maybe they aren't very obvious for non-native speakers while they are for native speakers? It's often littel details, or rather the tone of the sentence, that seems to make it the right answer.The access to templates etc. is great although they are available in the internet anyway if you know where to look.The skits remind me the TV distance learning for English in the 70ies in Germany. I find the funny but not as usefull as they could be. But I like the idea.",4
98417,"Just a wonderful course filled with rich details and priceless experiences. A must-see for all those seriously interested in management, whatever your field or industry.",5
98418,"It would be nice with more than [Ted the HVAC tech] to clear things up, he is hard to relate to if you have another kind of software you want to develop.Othervise i really like the methods and the videos, the teacher is easy to understand, he has good points and is good at explaning his material.",4
98419,Recommend this course as a good introduction. User Stories is most valuable part.,4
98420,I really liked the teacher and the course. With rich examples and study cases that usually are not find in this kind of courses. I found this course with the correct balance between theoretical and practical parts.,5
98421,"Classes are ok, but there is no support at all, no advisors to answer your questions, even if you pay for the course.",2
98422,"I'm learning so much.So excited to share this process and these principles in education, in business and my personal pursuits!!",5
98423,Clear theory with great tool and great example!,5
98424,Very practical course with lots of worked examples and templates - I can immediately relate this to my work and wish I had known some of these techniques in the past!,5
98425,"Its the best a an IT professional or product development expert has to keep handy with,as software and aspiring entrepreneur,it personally taught me a lot and changed the way i go about my development. If you ever want to have certainty over the market direction of your product,Agile Meets Design thinking might not be the only but is the best way to go.Thumbs up to the organizers of the course, it was not only well taught and delivered but fun and engaging.",5
98426,"Good course. Introduce you to agile methodology, and show how to do first steps in agile development. Also the is excellent, interesting assignment project",5
98427,Good content easily explained with practical approach. Recommended,5
98428,I enjoy how focused and well presented lectures are. My second course from Univ of Virginia prepared in a superb way.,5
98429,This course bolstered my framework of project management. Thank you! Can't wait to apply this to my next project.,5
98430,"Good introduction, goes deep enough with good examples",5
98431,great course,5
98432,"excellent mooc, thank you very much.",5
98433,A very good course! Thank you so much for putting the rich contents all together!,5
98434,Excellent course. Very informative. Great survey of a lot of information. Excellent production quality.,5
98435,It is a good starting point to utilize the advanced R programming techniques,5
98436,"It was very dificul, i think yoou need to improve the example you give the the students and be more interactive",3
98437,"Good content, a lot of work loaded in the quiz of the last week, beware of this.",4
98438,The instruction from the first three weeks does not sufficiently prepare me for the final project.,3
98439,"Excellent intro to using Tidyverse (dplyr, tidyr, readr) to manipulate and clean data in R. Occasionally the readings and the SWIRL homework don't quite match up, but it's not a dealbreaker by any means. It was definitely worth my time overall.",4
98440,Very helpful information provided that I will use on a regular basis.,5
98441,"This course, and the Specialization as a whole, is poorly structured and a rather cursory overview that is unlikely to satisfy serious learners. If the material is completely new to you then it will likely leave you confused as it does not adequately explain the concepts. If you are already somewhat familiar and are looking for deeper dive into R and programming you will be disappointed as the courses just don't have the depth of material needed to gain mastery over the subject.Your money and time would probably be better spent on a couple of books by Wickham.",1
98442,Great Course ¡,5
98443,"Excellent course. I learned a lot and was happy to have plenty of exercises for practice. If anything, I would suggest tweaking some of the R lessons in Weeks 1-3 to not give away the answer quite so quickly.",5
98444,This was a quick an relevant intro to the getting data and conducting basic manipulations,4
98445,"There's not much substance. Also, considering there is not video the course seems very non-interactive. Its nice to see the instructors speak and work through examples. Hoping this course was just a quick primer for the R newbies.",2
98446,"Very well organized material + Swirl tutorial, e-book + videos to get well versed with R programming",5
98447,One must have some R knowledge prior to take this course. I would recommend to take the other R programming course from the Data Science track before.,3
98448,Really enjoyed the way the course was presented.,4
98449,An excellent introduction to the concept of tidy data and the tools to manipulate it.,5
98450,"I feel that the training could be more extensive prior to assignments. The assignments often cause me to randomly search packages for correct functions to use and how to apply proper syntax, etc.",3
98451,"Amazing course, I would say addictive. However the swirl lesson #12 on Data Manipulation and quiz of week #4 on Reading and Summarizing Data offer a huge difficulty spike in comparison with the rest of the assignments. I would say almost too high compared to the rest, I would rather increase the difficulty gradually.",5
98452,"This is a good introduction to R but I do wonder if there could be a little more content, particularly in week 4.",4
98453,The course is a great introduction to R. The book is highly recommended.,5
98454,The material gets progressively tougher but I never felt totally overwhelmed. My only feedback is for the mentors to be more responsive in the forums - if we're posting it means we've already thrown everything at the question and still couldn't figure it out.,4
98455,Well thought out. Learnt some new approaches to common tasks.,5
98456,The instructors did nothing. They did not even respond to a single question through the entirety of the course. The information in the readings was helpful though.,3
98457,Course is good one. A bit on the tougher side for a beginner. More support should be provided in the quiz section from moderators in hlping understand the problem statement as for a beginer it becomes an overwhelming task,5
98458,Really like the way the quizzes work in this class. They force you to experiment and learn by doing.,5
98459,"The explanation is clear enough, assignments and courses are strongly related.",5
98460,This course was a very good and powerful intro in data wrangling and tidy data. The base of the course is the interactive swirl environment which lets you experiment and play around while guiding and teaching you. The exercises in the end of the course can be a challenge and force you to combine and use all the knowledge presented throughout the course.,5
98461,"Excelent course to start with the basics of R language. It gives a modern introduction to R programming avoiding traditional topics like loops and conditionals keeping them for more advanced programming topics. It also covers almost all tidyverse packages with a shallow introduction to the most common packages.I have acomplaint. The dataset for the final quiz was outdated, I managed to pass the quiz guessing variable names.",4
98462,"All in all good stuff. A couple of comments:Swirl grading should be a little more flexible; sure cut is more succinct that nested ifelse's, but there's more than one way to skin the data-analytic cat in R, as I'm sure y'all are aware.Also, I recommend more emphasis on data tables. I use them exclusively due to the dramatic performance improvement over data frames. And in my brief experiments, dplyr and tidyr commands worked on them too.This first course was review for me. Nonetheless I definitely learned a few practical things that will up my data science game (which can always use upping).",4
98463,Nice course and well explained through Swirl(),5
98464,I am a newer. I think this class is very helpful!,5
98465,"Course is good. However, some of the packages discussed in the examples, such as ggplot etc. should be discussed in more detail.",4
98466,A very nice introduction to the R programming environment. I learned a lot and it was fun to do!,4
98467,Could have been better. Expected some interaction/videos from the mentors.,4
98468,"This is a really great introductory course to R as a programming language. By the end of it, you do become proficient in reading data from different formats into R and in performing basic data manipulation routines using cutting edge packages. Fantastic if you are a beginner. If you are already fairly experienced in R, only the last week of the course may hold some interest to you.",5
98469,Very good introduction to R capabilities.,5
98470,"This course starts out with the basics of R programming and the use of the tidyverse set of package that are essential for data manipulation. By the time it reaches the fourth week, it takes more time and effort but is worth the effort.",5
98471,Perfect Course!,5
98472,One of the best R-coursera course. This course elevate my experiences on advanced data manipulation.,5
98473,REALLY NICE AND EFFECTIVE COURSE,5
98474,"The first course of the specialization is very simple. The specialization was announced to be on an intermediate level but at the same time, you need to spend money on a very basic course with swirl assignments pretty much copying the course content. The good thing is that it includes very modern approaches to data analysis and new packages. The second course is much better, nevertheless.",2
98475,I absolutely loved this class. It taught me very useful data manipulation techniques such as piping and other aspects of the tidyverse. I'd recommend the course to anyone interested in doing serious work in R.,5
98476,Really enjoyed and learned a lot.,5
98477,this course is a introductory level on the R usage!,4
98478,"very well, structure, the quiz was admirably hard, but satisfying to work through and solve. you made me think outside the box, excellent",4
98479,Superb advanced R course.,5
98480,An excellent introduction to the R-Programming Environment!,5
98481,"If you have done the Data Science Specialization prior, this is a lot of review. It is good review though. If there were any skills that would be good to get repeat practice on, it would be these skills.",5
98482,+: I reached my goal for the course and now I understand a bit about R. I succeeded to pass within much shorter time than anticipated course duration. The course certificate is posted to my Linkedin profile.-: No human mentors on the course discussion forum - all questions answered by other students. Automatic tests in swirl are too restrictive and do not accept perfectly correct student solutions slightly different to those anticipated by the authors. Week 2 assignment is much different from the reading material. Nothing taught about charting in R.Overall comment: I think it is good value for money.,4
98483,"this is an excellent online course. it involves many cutting-edge topics on online courses and learning assessment. You can appreciate very deep thoughts, amazing expertise of the instructor and innovative online course design here. It deserves your any time spent in this course.",5
98484,"This course is not free. You must pay to access assignments and quizzes.I am really annoyed with the direction Coursera is moving in regard to premium content. If they keep up this trend, I'll move to Class Central or other MOOCs.",1
98485,"I liked the course a lot. I was impressed by Dr Moerman's passion to qualitative research methods (though sometimes his vivid gesticulation and jumping distracted me from the material). Assignments were quite useful for understanding of course concepts, though they took a lot of time.",5
98486,"I really enjoyed this course, I would have liked a bit more explanation for certain concepts and perhaps some reading that were shorter, like articles (the suggested readings were mostly books). The assignments were designed to apply your knowledge and build on what you were learning, I thought this was a great learning experience!",5
98487,I found the video lectures less helpful with this course (than the quantitative course) and resorted to reading the transcripts in order to learn the important information. I did enjoy the assignments ( observation and interview processes) and found the application helped better understand the theory.,3
98488,"Fun classes, challenging assignments",5
98489,This course is so well done! The classes are taught with enthusiasm and the material covered is very interesting and valuable. Loved this class!,5
98490,"Engaging lecturer, relevant content. I was able to immediately use the content of this course in my work.",5
98491,Excellent course! Thank you very much.,5
98492,Really good course. Gerben Moerman is really good instructor and also I'd never bored while watching his videos.,5
98493,This is a very well presented course packed full of relevant information. I especially enjoy the prof's energy!,5
98494,"A very enthusiastic teacher, but the information was difficult to follow and some of the assessments took over 4 hours to complete. This made it hard to get the work done.",2
98495,"Thank you so much for this wonderful lecture! For the first time, I enjoyed a research method course! I learned more than a lot! I look forward to see more lectures! Thank you, thank you!!",5
98496,"This was a tougher course than I expected, but Dr. Moerman does a great job of taking a huge field with some inherently fuzzy concepts and practices, then breaking them down logically. The focus on assignments more than exams is really useful, since so much of qualitative research involves talking, listening, and writing.",5
98497,Too theoretical and completely disliked it. Even too basic for an introductory course. I paid it and got unitl week 4 and just couldn't find the motivation to continue.,1
98498,"This course is great, I enjoyed it.",5
98499,"Very vague, abstract ideas in the lectures. Would be much better if more real-life examples and scenarios were used in the lectures to convey those abstract ideas.",2
98500,the teacher is great! WOW,5
98501,"Great introductory course, with interesting, practical assignments and a very engaging lecturer. I recommend it for those at undergraduate/early stages of post-graduate studies who want to get a leg up in qualitative research methods.",5
98502,I found this course very useful and would recommend it to friends if they are interested,3
98503,"The teacher is really passionate, everything's very clear and easy to understand. It's full of all the basic knowledge one needs to know about qualitative research methods to begin working with them.",5
98504,Not recommended.,1
98505,"I found this to be an excellent course for not only developing my knowledge of qualitative research methods, but also expanding it. Having done a previous course in University I was surprised at the amount of new information this course had. The peer reviews felt fair and were always informative, I have never been exposed to such global critique!",5
98506,very good course,5
98507,The material is good and the professors quirky way of presenting is interesting to me at least. I'm enjoying his lectures and am able to follow his examples.,4
98508,Great job!,5
98509,"The course looks very interesting. The professor is very knowledgeable about the subject, so that makes learning it much easier. Thank you!",5
98510,Excellent introduction to qualitative research methods. Loved the lecturers enthusiastic style and quirky sense of humour. Very engaging.Assessments were practical and supported the course material.,5
98511,Great Course !!!,5
98512,Very well explained. The guy in the video jumps and make it harder to be distracted. Nice. I hope to see more courses from you.,5
98513,Scattered lectures that are hard to follow and choppy,1
98514,Awesome course!I loved the lectures and the homework assignments. They were fun and creative. Dr. Moerman is very well prepared in this subjects and his explanations were engaging and thought provoking. I hope I can meet him some day to thank him personally.Greetings!,5
98515,"Very good course. The tutor is simply awesome! His passion oozes out through every thought, word, gesture.",5
98516,"content is not good, too scattered content, cannot find focus.assignments are meaningless.",1
98517,"Interesting and very special course ,because of it qualitative nature.Though this also adds the assessment problems.I would give a 5+ ,if not the assessment part.",4
98518,"good; but not as good as the other modules in the specialisation; the instructions for the assignments are a bit too convoluted, clarity would be added not by adding more information, but by reducing the text.",4
98519,Just fabulous. The instructor is amazing.,5
98520,"I had done ALL the tasks in February-March - I don't remember exactly when, but I received my certificate in May. The course was interesting, but I needed the certificate for my application to university. Now I'm so dissapointed.",2
98521,Good theory and presentation,5
98522,"Very informative, lively and fun",5
98523,"Good combination of theory and practice. For the assignments you have to conduct an observation and an interview and analyse your collected data, without doing this as a researcher there won't be a complete understanding of the discussed theory.",5
98524,The lector is just amazingly incredible!!!,5
98525,"I found this course to be excellent. I really enjoyed the content and learned so very much.My only criticism is not of the course content but simply the nature of the course. I am currently working full time and doing a Masters degree part time, and I did this on top of that, so I found the work load to be exceptionally heavy. Not a problem for someone who isn't working though.Superb course - thank you.",5
98526,"Very enthusiastic lecturer, which made learning that much more enjoyable! The course content is fantastic. My only comment is the grading system for the assignments / how the assignments are designed - in my opinion the grading system could be improved to reflect efforts and correct submission done by students.",4
98527,"This course covered a broad swath of diverse material in an admirably compact form. The instructor was surprisingly passionate! about the topic, but once I got used to his style I could see it was because he was really invested in this type of work and really invested in getting us to understand it. Comprehension quizzes along with the lectures would have been nice to help absorb all the new vocabulary. There was also a creative use of the Coursera system to get us to do actual data gathering and coding (at least at a beginning level) on our own. As for the material, I felt like I was getting to see a secret world that everyone else around me already somehow knew about. As I am new to social science, I wondered how to find out about this secret arsenal of tools for dealing with interview and ethnography data that always seem to be referred to but never explained. Well, here they are! And now I have them too! Much appreciated.",5
98528,"The content and material were really good, interesting and challenging. I wanted to thank you very much for this really great introductory course.",5
98529,Wish I could have more interactions and discussions with other students. Would help clarify notions,4
98530,"I really enjoyed the course, I learned a lot and I am planning to do more focused reading on qualitative methods especially analysis. Gerban's presentations are excellent, I wish all tutors are like him, they are organised, clear and easy to understand.",5
98531,Great course! I am new in the field of qualitative research and I am enjoying every lecture here. Gerben is an interesting lecturer. I wish I could attend some of his class in person. I guess it must be difficult to fall asleep in his classes with his expressiveness.,5
98532,"For a Chinese student who rarely had experience touch on Western Philosophy, the startling line is a little complex and hard to gain the ""pure meaning"" of the course. But after look the videos over and over again, I feel better now. In China, I never witnessed a teacher jumping in front of the students, in front of the camera or in the livid classroom. So I really appreciate to see Mr. Moerman who show his passion in the field of study and teaching itself. I really love this course and the ""elephants"".Now I have less than 24 hours to finish the first assignment. Though many website are forbid by the ""Great wall"", such as google, I will do my best to finish the assignment which is the first English homework in my life.",5
98533,Great teacher and class!,5
98534,"Dr Moerman is passionate about qualitative research and does use some interesting examples to illustrate his ideas, some of which are drawn from his own research experiences. Do note that if you were to take this course, you need time because the assignments are time consuming and the videos are (I think) a little longer than they really need to be. Also, some of the assignments are designed in a pretty strange way (e.g. one week's assignment requires a shocking 10 peer reviews to pass but when I took the course, there were only a few submissions). This probably means I can't get my cert until the next session starts - if I'm lucky!",2
98535,"The instructor's presentations are so irritating due to him acting in a jumpy, nervous, and hyper-excited manner that I could not stand watching the lectures. If you don't mind that, it's probably not a bad course.",2
98536,"The lecture videos are interesting, engaging, and informative, and the assignments are so much fun to complete!",5
98537,"Excellent course , a lot of motivation!",5
98538,"This course is challenging and exciting. I liked the creative approach of the team, including graphic design and illustration work. The tasks are stimulating and very interactive. I could feel or at least imagine the spirit of the real qualitative research process. The theoretical and practical knowledge from the course was very useful for writing my master's thesis. Thank you!",5
98539,Video's were great but some of the assignments were unpractical and the tests were based on minuscule details.,2
98540,LOVED IT!!!!,5
98541,"good course, well thought through.some of the lectures didn't quite get the message across clearly and some of the assignments didn't quite measure what they intended, but overall i was much impressed, thanks.",4
98542,"Good course and teacher, learned a lot and kept me interested",5
98543,Great Learning site,5
98544,It is a course really helping people not to go library many years.,5
98545,"Clear videos's, structure is missing sometimes, but great examples",4
98546,"Engaging and broad-based course on qualitative research methods. Real world assignments were required, so there was a considerable commitment, which of course led to a sound learning experience. Generally I prefer courses with multiple lecturers, but the lecturer here was entertaining and interesting to watch, and very committed to ensuring that we learnt from the course. Also I noted that when students raised issues about the quizzes or assignments they were dealt with. Thanks Coursera and University of Amsterdam.",5
98547,Excellent course. Prof is just awesome.,5
98548,"An excellent teacher, interesting material, and demanding homework.",5
98549,This is a very good course that is helpful both to UG students and experts in this topic.,5
98550,"A very good course, although I think there are a couple of improvements that can be made. I flagged a few comments on various areas of the class.",4
98551,Very encouraging to go further on qualitative analysis.,4
98552,"I am a strictly Quantitative Scientist so I was not sure if I would like this course or enjoy it. Surprisingly, I both liked it and enjoyed it. It was interesting learning about the Qualitative Methods that I had no idea about. The professor is very animated and keeps your interest throughout the course. I now have an appreciation for Qualitative Research Methods instead of looking down my nose at them. Great Course with a great professor.",5
98553,"Very clear and concise explanation with fantastic examples to help with retaining information. The lecturer is full of life and it is very contagious.I joined this course to learn more about qualitative research. I am not new to qualitative research but i learn more each time I revisit the subject.If you intend to conduct some form of qualitative research as part of your job or preparation towards a postgraduate research degree, this course is a must enrol. Excellent",5
98554,Very animated and enthusiastic instructor. Providing the lecture slides was very helpful.,5
98555,"Good, but it lacks proper materials to come back to - slides are very heavy and not clear and transcript is missing connections to slides.",3
98556,The lecturer makes difficult concepts very approachable as well as making them interesting. These are some of the best explanations I have seen that are also easily accessible to undergraduates and learners new to this material.,5
98557,Very convoluted; examples not so clear; still interesting and well produced.,3
98558,Too abstract and unroganized,1
98559,"it was a lot of work and there were some errors and issues, esp. trouble with peer review. the professor was dynamic and encouraging. content and most activities were very helpful.",4
98560,excellent teacher!,5
98561,"A wordeful course. full energy and ideas for data analysis, Highly recommended",5
98562,I hope it will be helpful,5
98563,Very interesting and helpful course!,5
98564,this is a great course i loved it,5
98565,the best place to learning,5
98566,I would really like to appreciate coursera and Prof. Margaret Wooldridge and lastly University of Mighigan for providing an opportunity to underwent through this which has cleared all the basis and conceptual theory of the subject,5
98567,"Great course of thermodynamic. I learn a lot about energy generation, mechanical equipments and fluids properties",5
98568,Excellent way of explaining the subject! Hats off to you ma'am!,5
98569,Great course! The prof. Margaret have a awesome didatic.,5
98570,"Fantastic course. Want to revise and refine your basic thermodynamics concepts specially related to Mechanical engineering? Then go for it, This course is for you.",5
98571,I am very thankful of University of Michigan and Coursera. Thank you sir for giving me a chance to study in your institute.I have no words to say about your institute. Just say thank you.once again thank you..so much..,5
98572,Its Very Helpful,5
98573,"Very good for an introductory course, clear explanations and exercises. looking forward for more courses in medium level",4
98574,It is very useful,5
98575,"Great course and a very friendly professor :) However there were some mistakes here and there, which are annoying because you do not expect a professor to make such mistakes. Furthermore there could be more up to date, data. Especially data on energy use etc should not be from the year 2004 if we are in 2017. Overall though a biiiiiig thank you!",4
98576,thank you very much,5
98577,Excellent course teaching the fundamentals of thermodynamics.,4
98578,Simply Perfect it!! I have no comments to it!,5
98579,I started learning courses from online this is so use full to me.I also recommended my friends to learn online.THANKS FOR PROVIDING THIS COURSE.,5
98580,"I wanted to learn cycle part in Thermodynamics. The professor gave me a new insight in terms of renewable energy, consumption of energy, etc.Thanks. I appreciate your class.",5
98581,"Excellent overview of the First and Second Laws of Thermodynamics. I gained insight into how power is generated across the world and became more fluent in working with concepts such as work, enthalpy, entropy, total internal energy, specific heat, and others.",4
98582,A useful course for anyone in chemical engineering. I enjoyed the material. Its well structured. Would be nice if Professor Wooldridge gave more example problems.,4
98583,"Easy to understand and a must required basic course for Thermal Engineering. Pretty much focussed on Steam cycles only (but good for me). I would also say that it is not the course material but presentation of it, that makes a course interesting and I really liked that here. Thanks to all the good people involved in the making of it and above all to Prof. Margaret. Thank you!",5
98584,"The course is really helpful as a refresher for somebody who studied the subject 10 years back. I loved how the concepts were explained. Its a must recommend for any body who is going to study the subject in Undergrad to get good hold on concepts. Thanks for the course, It was something that I really needed at this moment in my assignment",5
98585,"i find this course so useful, so now i can better let students to understand well.",5
98586,This course is a very good introductory course to Thermodynamics. It has a lot of depth and breadth not just of the core Sciences but of the applications and other ramifications too. It is a good course to get a decent grasp of the subject for higher learning.,5
98587,"Excellent course, the topics are very nice selected, and the teacher (Prof. Wooldrige) is amazing; excellent teaching abilities. The grade exercises are nice, although some of them are not well solved. If they can put the solution after each test could be excellent. Nevertheless, I think this a must take course for getting the principal thermodynamics concepts or getting a review of them.",5
98588,"It's a good course and learnt many things and the expert Dr. Wooldridge has awesome skill in teaching, an expert touch. Good course good teaching. But I thought available and unavailable energy modules will also be there, that was missing. Except that, it's wonderful.",5
98589,"I really liked the course. The explanations have been very clear. I think that, apart from the problems solved by the professor, they should provide a collection of problems solved step by step to practice and better assimilate the concepts.",5
98590,Course is great and very useful for thorough understanding of Thermodynamics. But Exergy and Second law efficiency was not discussed. It should also be included,4
98591,"I am an electrical engineer, working for mechatronics company. This course is very useful to improve understanding and inculcate relevant thought process when you have to deal with engines or other mechanical systems. Thanks a lot. It helped me. Looking for other courses like Fluid Mechanics, Fluid Dynamics, Heat Transfer etc.",5
98592,More Helpful. Clearly describes the hard concepts. Thank you,5
98593,A very useful course for those who wants to learn about Thermodynamics. The Professor taught every topics in detail. I learnt a lot from this course.,5
98594,"Starts off great, but quickly jumps into really dense course material moving quickly between topics with few images or examples while watching the lecturer slowly scribble on the slides. I expected more discussions in the videos with variance between visual, heavy calculations at a slower pace and high-level applications. Quizzes are long and redundant and there isn't enough recognition of the relationship between climate change and thermodynamics.",2
98595,Very good introdution to thermodynamics. Good teacher,5
98596,"I very well structured and interesting course, with simple and easy understandable learning methods for the principles of Thermodynamics!",5
98597,"Really helpful on refurbishing my Thermodynamic basics,Thanks a lot Mrs. Margaret Wooldridge",5
98598,"This is a very interesting and rewarding course. It would help if the format was broken up a bit more. Perhaps with some video of power plants, turbines, etc. I enjoyed the ""excursions"" to see the jet engine and internal combustion engine. More like that would liven the material up a bit.",4
98599,this course was awesome :),5
98600,"I have taken a few courses before landing up on this one and I must say, it was an absolutely amazing experience! The Professor taught the nuisances of Thermodynamics with examples and in great detail which really helped me understand the subject. Thank you Professor, her team, the University of Michigan and Coursera for such a brilliant course.",5
98601,Very nice course! I would request the teacher to have follow-up courses as well on advanced topics.,5
98602,The lectures are crisp and clear. The fundamental concepts are well explained with adequate supporting examples.,5
98603,"so cool, and intersting",5
98604,"Great course, very detailed and clear. Wish it would cover a little more material like entropy calculation etc.",5
98605,It's a wonderful course to deal with it.,5
98606,"The best of all I have seen here, If you looking for deep insight of thermodynamics this is the best place.",5
98607,"EXCELENTE CURSO, ENRIQUECEDOR Y SOBRE TODO ADQUIRIR MAS CONOCIMIENTOS",5
98608,Great course! It definitely helped me to sort everything out about interface design.,5
98609,The course material and examples are very useful. I really like the CF spreadsheet at the end of week 4 as this is very organized CF model and I can use this as reference to build my own. Thank you!,5
98610,I had a great experience with this course. The course content was short and concise.,5
98611,The professors take you almost by the hand with the basic concepts but the one you must master in order to have a good solid foundation. Amazing course!!,5
98612,"It is a great course, however some practical examples to try would benefit users",3
98613,The information is reviewed quickly through the lectures series and it would have been helpful to have some practice scenarios before taking the quiz. It's more helpful to review different spreadsheet layouts to familiarize how variables are organized.,3
98614,"Very little modelling in this course, instead you get some accounting lectures which are pretty difficult to follow if you have no previous accounting knowledge. Very boring lectures, too!",2
98615,Thank you for bringing this curriculum to Coursera. I enjoyed the courses and,5
98616,"Some modules are better than others. There is a strong emphasis in accounting rather than modelling, which was not what I was looking for.",3
98617,Very helpful in its overview of the connections in the modifications in financial statements. Lecturer is concise and easy to follow.,5
98618,Excellent! Really nice spreadsheets examples.,5
98619,Great course by two great economists.,4
98620,"A very useful course, in terms of both the theory and applicable knowledge! Thanks a lot!",5
98621,This is really good course for finance students who want to learn about project valuation. I learn a lot about how value project in real life scenarios and know about investment opportunities. I would highly recommend you to take this course.,5
98622,"This course was okay. It could be improved by incorporating some concepts and principles of a previous course, ""Modeling Risk and Realities"".",3
98623,Turned out to be a course in financials rather than modeling. The whole specialization could have been designed to make better progress in modeling.,2
98624,This course has felt irrelevant in comparison to some of the other courses in this specialisation and this has a very narrow focus which doesn't help. Not all of us are accountants.,3
98625,Very detailed and practical.,5
98626,THANK YOU!,4
98627,"Excellent course!!! The spreadsheet analysis was very helpful, and I really appreciated the structure of the course. Nice job!",5
98628,This is a great course! I have worked in the Operations sides of the business and this course gave me much need perspective into the corporate finance and account domains. Thank you to the two Professors involved. Great content and easy to follow and understand the reasoning and the why.,5
98629,"Having completed my MBA, I wanted a course which can help revisit basics. While I am certainly able to do that, I see lot of points getting answered just by watching the video...Must have course..if you are planning to do an MBA soon or are curious about project evaluation...",4
98630,An amazing course!,5
98631,Should have discuss some of this material earlier in the course as introduction.,4
98632,"Excellent. Informative, and covers a lot of ground",5
98633,Great Course - thoroughly enjoyed,5
98634,Very good online decision-making and scenarios course!,5
98635,Covers the most important financial decision making tools and explains weakness and strengths of various methods. Comparative focus on concepts such as IRR and NPV apart from integrating these with spreadsheet makes this course a must do for the aspirants.,5
98636,Found a lot of interesting and important information for me here. Excellent information on making prognosis tied with accounting and financial reports,5
98637,Excellent thoughts and concepts presented.,5
98638,Excellent course. Both professors do an excellent job presenting a large amount of information in a structured fashion. I learned a lot!,5
98639,great course. I recommend it,5
98640,Two professors gave very clear instructions in the course. It's much easy for foreign students to understand the course. It's a little bit essential againt the topic decision making because of the major of content is basic of financial management.,4
98641,"I liked the class and it gave good information. The professors ordered the materials well, and I would recommend anyone to take this MOOC.",5
98642,Material is what I was looking for to model decision making in a business/project setting. More practice would have been useful and extra material such as e-books or articles.,4
98643,Thank you for an amazing course filled with valuable and applicable information!Ono,5
98644,"Great course, great teachers!",5
98645,A bit less engaging than the other parts of the Executive Data Science course.,3
98646,this course gave good foundation.,5
98647,Thanks for the awesome content!!!,5
98648,Very informative course.. ample of examples to relate with topics.,5
98649,It was quite hard with all the statistical jargon. Too much theory.,3
98650,"This class was bit more difficult than the previous ones and it requires really focused attention on understanding the subject matter. The course is intended to improve your understanding in subjects of surrogate variables, and how to become a better database manager. Excellent course!",5
98651,"Brian Caffo does a terrific job teaching some of more advanced material, I very much appreciate his jokes and humor, as well as his helpful explanations of the material.",5
98652,very nice course,5
98653,Great Course for Learning Data science practical applications.,5
98654,"The content was redundant at times, at other the dots that were trying to be connected were to wide apart on the spectrum",2
98655,Practical approach and gotchas to consider for doing data science in real life,4
98656,Helpful tips for handling problems during the several life cycle stages of a Data Science project.,5
98657,Good summary on experimental design.,4
98658,"Clear explanation of various concepts with good examples. Of course, reference to some cool cartoons from time to time made the concepts more memorable!",5
98659,More real world examples are required,4
98660,Lots of useful tips. Great overview spanning data science pitfalls. Impressively concise.,5
98661,"Excellent course. The material is good enough that will help me where to look for information, considerations, a",5
98662,Much theorical with few examples. Could incorporate examples outside the health world as well.,3
98663,Fantastic Course for people who want to know the details to do great analysis and reports,5
98664,Some of the material here was repeated from other courses but overall I felt this was my favorite course in the series. I particularly appreciated the real life examples of what can go wrong with data collection and suggestions/best practices for how to handle that. It gave me a lot of ideas for how to deal with some uncertainties I was facing in some of my own research.,4
98665,The other courses in the exec series are a little simple. This started to address some core analysis issues and how to address them in a real life situation. A good reminder and thought provoker on what should be trying to do within the enterprise,5
98666,Highly educative and recommended,5
98667,It's sometimes difficult to follow professors beacuse they take for granted information about the examples they use that is not evident for the learners. They should take a minute to explain a little bit more what the examples consist of and what are the charts they show. As it happens when Brian Caffo explains the blocking adjustments part.,3
98668,Nice course thx,5
98669,"I missed several concepts to better understand some of the discussions and explanations. It was valid, but I think the statistics background should be better explored.",3
98670,"Some good tips, nothing terribly new for those who have had a course in statistics. Materials made easy to digest. The variety from the 3 instructors was nice. Missed opportunity: to combine the best aspects from each. The course notes were either excerpts from R.Peng's books /blogs (good) or automated transcripts (complete with typical AI typos... ""wait"" instead of ""weight""). Some lectures were repetitive from one course to another. Slides with examples were useful, slides with clip-art and comic stips less so. Tries to be something for everyone. Would be better to aim either at former DS analysts aspiring to be managers or seasoned managers trying to better understand DS.",3
98671,An amazing course for those who are not very familiar with statistics and a very refreshing perspective for those who actually knows statistics!,5
98672,somewhat demanding in some of the points but effective,5
98673,A solid course with lots of practical advice.,4
98674,Short session need more handson excercise,4
98675,Dr.Caffo is really well-versed with his field but I feel like concepts should be given more concrete examples so that they seem more interesting. Respect him all the way!,4
98676,"good course, but focus more on inferential analysis than predictive analysis",4
98677,"My name is Jose Antonio from Brazil. I am looking for a new Data Scientist career.Please, take a look at my LinkedIn profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseantonio11I did this course to get new knowledge about Big Data and better understand the technology and your practical applications.The course was excellent and the classes well taught by teachers.Congratulations to Coursera team and Instructors.Regards",5
98678,Excellent experience - I cant wait for the capstone project.,5
98679,"Brian tries to achieve too much in too little time. It addresses important issues and it gives a good overview, including some hidden gems (Machine Learning vs Stats, for example), but it feels mostly too rushed and superficial for my taste/expectations, and it fails to connect to my previous knowledge (and I have a PhD in Maths, although no strong Stats background), hence little added value for me when I cannot relate to what is being discussed.",3
98680,"Is good to have some data science background to enroll in this course, overall still good to learn and get the hint of how real life data scientist life is.",4
98681,"Was expecting soo much more from the entire courses. Not a single practical part, soo much talk and write.Sorry would not share the course with friends, 190€ is too much for what I have just learned.",1
98682,Like this one as well as the others in the series,5
98683,Good Presentation; informative & engaging,5
98684,Quality of this course is better than the rest of the specialization.,4
98685,"Necessities: practical tools and techniques for managing real life issues with data cleanliness, interpretation of results, report writing, version control. All of them complete necessities for real life commercial projects.",5
98686,Too much focus on technicalities - not management based.,2
98687,Good review on how to work and interact with the team during the data analysis pipeline!,5
98688,"Great information. For real newbies like me, might help to review basic concepts a few times (e.g. what does ""p"" mean? I know it was explained, but didn't grasp it the first time, helps if I hear it a few times, etc.) But, hey, you guys have done a fantastic job pulling all this together and teaching it at the 30,000 ft. view level. So great job.",5
98689,"great for existence human and android based life-form simulation internal lifestyle...The course improves life within the simulation 10 fold at least(when combined with the other specialization courses) ...Perfect learning tool for those who have worked professionally in research field sin our simulation and yet now have a touch of ""the turrings"" or you know : CBI...Special thanks to the designers of the course.Top scores for coursera.org &John Hopkins ...",5
98690,"Relevant materials, but lecture delivery is rather dry,",3
98691,Good concepts - apply to anyone new to data science.Lot of good 'read further' links and materials. Learnt a lot.,4
98692,This is really a very nice course for learning data science in solving real life problems.,5
98693,"great approach, thanks. A few typos, but otherwise great.",4
98694,"Again a course with depth in content but the presentation of the course could improve , it seems a bit patchy and pre-reads would help.",4
98695,"Excellent course! The only thing I would say is that many managers from the corporate field simply would find it too ""academic"". But this was a huge plus for me - and I think the course will serve extremely well also to anyone who works in academic research and has to handle some real-life data.",5
98696,"Practical using the data science in real life, a lot of extending learning.",5
98697,Excellent overview course on Data Science,5
98698,Awesome feedback on real life situations where i managed to pass through on my current job.,5
98699,"The course tests are at times partially unrelated to the content of the lessons. In the test of Lesson 7 we are asked if removing jargon from an analysis makes the analysis clearer. This is never mentioned in the course.The question does not have a unique yes/no solution. It depends on the context, in particular on the audience of the analysis and report. If I'm talking to technical people who knows a lot about the topic jargon can be useful, on the other hand if jargon is not documented it can be confusing.How are we supposed to know this?This is just one example, but all the courses of the EDS specialisation had these issues. I don't know if it is a language barrier or what but I feel that I didn't have a chance to study more to get a better score. You either happen to have the same idea of the teacher or you don't, and this is not professional.",1
98700,"Excellent course, material and superior teaching.",5
98701,"wonderful in all ways, I really enjoyed it!",5
98702,Short yet nice. Gave me a lot of insights on what can and can't be done.,5
98703,Marvelous!,5
98704,This was a great final to the Data Science Executive Specialization.,5
98705,"Brian, Jeff, and Roger: Thank you very much for all the data science courses, really great. I generally rate them 5 stars. But for this one, I'm giving 3 stars, not because the content is not good (it is; it provides good practical and experiential information), but rather because the material seems repetitive at times either within the same course or with topics in the other courses. Also, the sequencing and lectures seem sometime a bit disjointed.May I humbly suggest an idea: Integrate the key points of this course relating to real-world examples and the sharing of real-world experiences into one of the other courses.Thank you.Robert Al-Jaar, PhDrobert.aljaar@rassociates.biz",3
98706,"Very interesting course, I recommend!",5
98707,"Too short, too expensive.",3
98708,Pretty useful course,4
98709,Very practical views,4
98710,"Lectures themselves were OK, but presentation needs work. Intro session was very repetitive. Lot of jargon introduced without explanation. Pop-ups w text showed up but disappeared before I was able to finish reading them. Best part of course was actually the text notes at the beginning of each sesssion. A minor nitpick: course description suggests that there are 3 instructors presenting, but I only saw one.",3
98711,"The video quality and content were good. Unfortunately, there were a lot of spelling errors and grammatical mistakes in the written portions.",3
98712,"The course is a good compilation of essential concepts to avoid pitfalls during analysis. Most material is given a short intro only, so a good data science background is needed to appreciate the material presented here.",5
98713,very bad and not organised,1
98714,I really enjoyed the comparison of what is ideal vs. what actually happens when it comes to data science. This was a very practical course and gave insight into what to expect from data science and analysis.,4
98715,Very nice overview of what can go wrong in a data science project and what to pay attention to.,4
98716,"It is a poor course because is not properly designed for internationals. Language is mainly French in slides and subtitle is not that helpful.Instead of spending time outside to read the notes, it was better to prepare helpful slides for students to understand better what you are talking about.",1
98717,It was an enjoyable and quite complete course. I really learned a lot from this. Thank you so much!!!!,5
98718,Very interesting course on water management and policies! I strongly recommend it!,5
98719,Great introductory course. The content covers current topics such as the Water-Energy-Nexus.,4
98720,I enjoyed the course it was very educating.,5
98721,This course was very helpful to me.,5
98722,"This course was great- I certainly enjoyed learning about water resources management and policy. As I have a legal background, I particularly found Professors Sangbana and Mbengue's discourse on the legal aspect of water resources management (Module 5) engaging. In addition, the course presented different case studies as well as various interviews with numerous resource persons that allowed me to have a grasp of the real world applications of the concepts involved.",5
98723,A very interesting course to understand what is happening in the space of Water Management and Policy at International level. A good mix of theoretical frameworks as well as practical case studies.,4
98724,Very interesting and insightful information! Very Nice and positive learning experience! Thank you!,5
98725,Through this course I was given a lot of information on water management policies throughout history. Sometimes the practical applications were difficult to visualize in a real-world context although there were many case studies shown (maybe because being from the U.S. we have a less politically complex system). A strong emphasis was placed on international laws that are relevant today. If I end up working within the water sector in the U.S. I expect that this knowledge will help me put my work into a broader perspective and help me find innovative solutions to problems. The translation of the script from French to English needs more work. Sometimes it took me longer to understand concepts due to poor translation or spelling errors.,4
98726,Highly effective for who are involved in water resources management.,5
98727,"The information presented was interesting, and the instructors were engaging. However, I had major issues with the translation. It was completely literal, and often translated in ways that did not make sense. If I did not have a working knowledge of academic French, I would have been lost. Also, many of the test questions were unclear and did not follow best practices in test taking.",3
98728,"It has a very interesting topic to know about, I only wish they could fix the subtitles to a more organic English",4
98729,Great Course!!!,5
98730,"This was an interesting introduction to water resource management. I found it very useful to learn about the institutional regime, when having to face a multisectoral problem and the methods to address it. I particularly enjoyed the fact that there were numerous case studies discussed such as the Nile basin or the Mekong basin. In order for you to improve the efficacy of this course i would suggest the following measures:a) a synopsis of the main laws and directives regarding the protection and management of water resource in the last course.b) Further analysis on how to deal with certain general problems such as the case when a country upstream pollutes the waters that head to the country downstream, that you mentioned in your last video. I would like to see more examples of management of such a conflictThank you",4
98731,A good course for water professionals.,5
98732,An interesting course. Videos were in French but read the script in English to understand,4
98733,A highly empowering course in terms of Water management,4
98734,Nice way to teaching,5
98735,"Well designed, informative and very useful. Helps in understanding the complexity of water management from multiple perspectives.",5
98736,"This course introduced me to new valuable concepts, that I find useful in my daily work. I liked tha clarity of most of the teachers. The case studies served to understand better the concepts presented. However, I would have liked to learn more about the situation regarding water resource management in South America.",4
98737,"Very informative overview, excellent platform",5
98738,I was referred to this course by Diplofoundation Institute (University of Malta) after completing my thesis there on water management in the West Bank. I would like to thank to faculty of the University of Geneva (WaterHub) for providing me with high-level and beautifully structured information on European as well as global water management. Very inspirational.,5
98739,"Very interesting course, providing a descent overview of the whole water management and policy question. A lot of interesting examples are provided to illustrate the different points and various experts are interviewed throughout the course. I still believe though that the general message remains very generic and would benefit from further technical details to go more in depth. Also, the English subtitles do not always exactly match the oral French version.Finally, the marking only based on quizzes that can be retaken several times makes it very easy in my view. I believe that assignments that would require more involvement from the students (e.g. maybe group assignments with other students?) or applications of the course concepts to case studies would greatly enhance the quality of the course.Still, it remains a very interesting and well dispensed course!",3
98740,This course is really amazing and I highly recommend to anybody working in this field.,5
98741,"Interesting and informative. Perfect combination of lecturers, information and amazing views. Look forward to Water Resources Management and Policy 2.0!!!",5
98742,"This course provided me a strong comprehensive understanding of the basics of water management and the issues associated with it, which was effectively demonstrated through case studies across the world.",5
98743,Great Course,4
98744,"very interesting course, with good examples. Just the fact it is french with quizz in english makes it not that easy!!! Some of the module are just too theoretical. But nice, very good overall",5
98745,"Great course, but can be tasking for English speakers",4
98746,The best tutors on this subject. Swiss and international case studies. Interviews with a lot of professional experts. RECOMMENDED 100% if you are involved in public/private water management sector.,5
98747,I am really thankful to Dr. Christian Brethaut and Professor Geraldine Pflieger. Thank you very much for this wonderful course. Looking forward to meet you in another course.,5
98748,"I highly recommend this course. The class was very informative and structured in such a way that it built the understanding and knowledge of Water Resources Management in a local and global perspective in a smooth flow. The films are mostly in French, with English subtitles. And you can access to the text in English which you can download and read for note",5
98749,"Muy buen curso. Very nice course. Loads of interesting things to learn. Maybe some compulsory readings would be nice and will help structure the content of the course. Still, very very interesting and quite mind blowing. Recommend it for sure.",4
98750,The course and the course material were very informative . The lectures were also veru to the point. It was very nice learning experience!!!Thank you once again!!!,5
98751,"Since I'm working on water modelling (computational fluid dynamics, programming shallow water simulations), I thought it would be fun to learn more about the political side. However, this course has very little in-depth information (pun not intended) and I would like to know more about the actual tools used to design water policies. Though the course is most likely too easy for most university students, it is also very abstract and I would have liked having to do a little more thinking on the real-world examples myself.",3
98752,the last task is very challenging,5
98753,"Apart from the book the courses does not offer me anything. No videos, no active forum, no explanation. Also the assessment is not interesting and there is no much information in the teaching material in order to be able to do the assessment.I am very disappointed with this Specialization.",2
98754,"So first of all, the material for this course in the bookdown document are very good - well structured, with good sources. My concern is that the Coursera course does not go a lot beyond, basically just referring to the document and adding quizzes + graded assignment in the last week. The assignment, however, is nice and challenging and requires people to understand the materials.Also, the course covers other great packages than ggplot2, e.g. plotly and leaflet and methods for handling spatial data. I think it would be very nice if the students were challenged in these topics as well and evaluate them in a better way than just a quiz (programming assignment for instance).I liked the course though and I believe it can be prepared even better.",3
98755,The first three weeks of this course is ok. The last assignment is very poorly structured with uninformative instructions.,1
98756,This course should be made mandatory is all schools and work places around the world NOW !!!,5
98757,"Thomas Berry was a visionary, illuminating our context and leading the way forward to give hope to our generation and those to come. This is a call to action from the future. The vision of a flourishing Earth community, where humans enhance and nurture, brings me great hope and purpose. What a gift.",5
98758,"A fantastic course that deepened my understanding of the brilliant thought of Thomas Berry, bringing to life his personal story and the stories he told.",5
98759,"Amazing! Awe-inspiring! I have found great energy, wisdom, and respite from this series of courses, as I work everyday to maintain environmental policies and laws. I loved the organization, and will continue to write on these subjects. I appreciate all your extraordinary effort in putting these courses together.",5
98760,Nice; contemplate this wonderful jorney,5
98761,I had never read Thomas Berry and with this course I just couldn't stop reading his books and the vision he had about the earth and his view of Teilhard de Chardin.,5
98762,It's beautiful! I've never described any coursera courses this way. This lecture guides us widen and enhanced world around us. I believe it make us becoming better beings. Thank you!,5
98763,I really enjoyed this training and I intend to deepen my knowledge in NodeJS. Thank You,5
98764,Good course,5
98765,It is very good course. Teachs basics of NodeJs and backend and also gives some tricks. I recommend this course whoever want to learn NodeJs.,5
98766,thanks,5
98767,One of the best courses I ever took. The course material is amazing with proper instructions. More focus is put on building basics which is the need in the present world.,5
98768,"Very challenging, the lecture are really deep and could be improve ..overall really helpful!",5
98769,The course is excellent.The professor is very clear and presents many concepts and resources usefuls.,5
98770,Its good to get started with server side development with node.,3
98771,Excellent course to learn a lot about back end server development. The coverage is not only for database and APIs but touches upon user authentication etc. as well. I have a good grounding on server side development now. Thanks.,5
98772,Wonderful course to learn Server-side coding. Again Thanks a lot to Jogesh K Muppala for explaining each every topic very clear.,5
98773,Great course by great person!,5
98774,Very good but basic course.,5
98775,Excellent course and teaching lessons the examples are according the videos and the teacher has a lot of patience explaining everything with details.,4
98776,"i do not understand why do i need in the videos see the face of the lecturer? i rather see the whole screen of code / slides why do i need to see him talk?in every site of videos like ""pluralsight"" etc u do not see the lecturer.concerning this course.. i was a bit disappointed i thought it would give me more profound knowledge on node. but it was cool.",4
98777,Great course. Smart and fun !,5
98778,Excellent course material narrated in detail.,5
98779,"Nothing but following the lectures, hardly any quizes or assignments where you have to work things out on your own. Also, there's way too much material crammed into four weeks, leading to a lack of depth. I learned a lot, but this was not very engaging.",2
98780,I like the humor of the professor although I can not understand what that means.,5
98781,Good tutorials .. That's not because it is FREE ..,5
98782,"Awesome Course, Learnt many things.",5
98783,awesome course!!!!,5
98784,This is very well designed course.,5
98785,one the best backend development courses on the web . covers a lot of topics . and yet gives you enough depth to be able to discover the rest on your own. the only problem with it is that it stall on the some basic stuff and then accelerates (a little) when it comes to the more advanced techniques.,4
98786,Very good course. Features well explained.,4
98787,"Best course for Node.js, express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose and putting them all together in perspective!",5
98788,Very applicable and lot of insight into new NodeJS Territory,4
98789,Realy great!,5
98790,"A well structured course that gives a good introduction to NodeJS. The final assignment does have a bit of a ramp in difficulty. However, I prefer it if a course has some challenges in it because I feel it is when you learn the most.",5
98791,"clearly structured, easy to understand; different technology stacks, quite complete; to my knowledge, the only course of this kind available.",5
98792,"Superb Course, Thank You!",5

98796,This course is awesome,5
98797,Excellent! First time in the server-side; it was a very good course.,5
98798,Slow and redundant. Would have preferred a faster-paced and more substantive course.,2
98799,This course is the best starting material for learning server programming,5
98800,Really an awesome course.,5
98801,Great course! I learned so much and the difficulty is really well graded.,5
98802,Nice course for Full stack.,4
98803,Very helpful. With this we do not need to reinvent the wheel. Can REST easy (pun intended) on server side and focus more on the application.,5
98804,Great course! I'm glad I did it.,5
98805,"The course is suitable for any programmers even you only have very basic knowledge on Javascript and no experience on Web development, professor is teaching the Node.js in a very clear structure so it is easy for any learners to understand.I would give 5 stars but the contents of this courses are too basic, I am hoping we can dig into a little bit the details instead of just installing and using the existing components.",5
98806,"Great introductory course, however, there are some anti-patterns taught (e.g. mongodb unbounded arrays). Also, there is no testing frameworks used - and this is a big missing element for modern careers in web development.",3
98807,Great course. Very informative. Fully integrated API's as a result of completing this course.,5
98808,"I love this course. Muppala sir, taught so well they explain each and every topics so well.",5
98809,"Concise and to the point in every corner, lean like a good verse, the path is clear as you go. A sum of seemingly simple parts constitute a valuable body of knowledge, covering hours of alternative late night stackoverflow sitting. Thank you, Prof. Muppala!",5
98810,really amazing,5
98811,It's exellent course I have ever studied. I would like to thank Professor Muppala very much.,5
98812,"There's a lack of crucial information such as how to merge AngularJs with all the Back-End. A few chapters such as cookies and session could had been skipped, even the prof. Muppala doesn't advice to use them, but as they're easy to teach so they're explained intead of more imporant things.I'm getting crazy to do the most simple thing: a MEAN Stack Login.So why is not explained the most usual thing here? There are no excuses. Login and uploading files IS IMPORTANT to be learned.",2
98813,The course is a very good start to learn NodeJS. Strong recommend for anyone who wants to start NodeJS.,5
98814,"It provides good resources and code, but if you get stuck, there's no help. By the time one gets this far the participation has plummeted and there's no mentors or instructor help. Very frustrating to get this far only to be stopped because you're on your very own.",3
98815,Enthusiastic instructor,5
98816,"Very good explanations about each topic, some times instructor is explaining basics to get more knowledge on topic. Excellent. Thanks for opportunity.",4
98817,Quite easy to understand!,4
98818,Very good curriculum! Everything explained in the correct way. Each unit has its concrete topic. All needed to start work in this field.Thank you so much.,5
98819,learned a lot. I,5
98820,Mr. Muppala has a natural talent for teaching.,5
98821,Amazing course!Mr. Muppala is a rockstar!,5
98822,"This is the best, most comprehensive NodeJS course on the internet, PERIOD!",5
98823,The direction of the content is correct. First node and then his wrapper Express.,4
98824,This course covered most of topics and very well explained. Unit testing for nodejs could also have been part of it. Oauth2 and JSON webtokens and Mongoose concepts are very well explained.,5
98825,very good course,5
98826,Enough material to make this a two course. Feels more crammed than other courses but invaluable coverage.,4
98827,EXCELLENT! Worth taking. Professor is awesome!,5
98828,Very interesting course and learnt many new things. Excellent teaching and assignments. Highly recommend to others who want to learn nodejs and mongodb!,5
98829,Great content and teaching! Thanks Professor Muppala!,5
98830,Awesome Course. easy to understand.,5
98831,Extremely boring and very confusing,1
98832,It's a good course but it lacks web socket and socket io . Please add a few lessons for them,5
98833,"I have learn a lot, big thanks to the PHd!",5
98834,Excelent course! Many different aspects are studied.,5
98835,I'm enjoying this practical course,5
98836,Good enough to be an intro.,4
98837,great course for node beginner. Let's continue to create some great course,4
98838,Awesome Course !!!!,5
98839,"Great introductory class on Node.js! I took this without the other courses in the specialization, and found it to meet my needs perfectly.",5
98840,Great course!,5
98841,Lots of useful information!,5
98842,Excellent course covering a wide range of topics and tools.,5
98843,"The course is challenging, but the professor is really awesome.",4
98844,Super basic! The instructor goes super slowly and spends a lot of time on unnecessary stuff. Each video can be down in half the time,3
98845,"This was a good introduction to the topic, although a little slowly paced for my tastes, but I am a long time professional programmer, so I have much more background to draw on than many of the students. I started with this course, which encouraged me to go back and take more from the sequence. I recommend taking them in order.",4
98846,"Fantastic Course, Learn a lot!",5
98847,Just Awesome,5
98848,"Though I did not finish the entire course, I have learned a lot on all the topics I am interested. Highly recommended.",5
98849,"One of the best courses, very useful material and the teacher was great !!!",5
98850,"This course has covered most thing I need to know about about developing a website using MEAN. The lecture notes is easy to understand. After learnt this course, I have learn web development my self cause this course has provide real experience on not only learn with professor but also doing self learning.",5
98851,Great course to learn the basics of server-side development with nodejs,5
98852,Great teacher!,5
98853,Very interesting explanation \,5
98854,Loved it.,5
98855,"Seems like the quality of this specialization goes down with every course. The instructor is not showing us the way we should think about developing programs in NodeJS, but he insists on using PowerPoint slides to show us how to code! It's 2016, and there are way better mediums for communicating with your students. Simply copying and pasting code and explaining what every line does is not the right way of teaching any concept, especially when you are dealing with a new technology. For the start, the instructor can actually type the code and explain what goes through his mind during each step. That way anyone can follow his problem solving methods and benefit from the course.I had to take other online courses on Code School and Pluralsight just to understand what's going on, and later come back to finish the homework.",1
98856,the instructor is awesome .,5
98857,Great course for anyone interested in web development,4
98858,"Great contents as the rest of the courses in the specialization. I'm afraid I need to be a little bit critical with this one though:1) The contents are really jammed into 4 weeks - The last week's contents are actually some kind of miscellany between mongoose, https, authentication and BaaS2) Not a single quiz or self-evaluation of sorts along the course - To be completely fair, the exercises shown along the way might make up for it. Still, I think it's important to spread some quizes around so as to make absorb the concepts more effectively3) The quality of the presentations is somewhat lower than other courses. There's even a video towards the end of the course where a Linkedin notification springs up on top, which even makes the presenter pause for a few seconds.Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed this course and definitely appreciate the effort put into it - Given the newly introduced Coursera fees, I'd expect much more quality in place to make it 70 buck-worth, though",3
98859,I learned a lot new things,5
98860,happy for learning this course,5
98861,"I love the subject.To be honest for the first glance I didn't bet all my coins in this course, but I really got fascinated, the teacher indeed explains all the steps required and forth in order to grasp the idea around what is gonna be explained.",5
98862,Amazing professor. Many thanks for taking the pains to explain the concepts so lucidly,5
98863,"very clear, recommend!!",5
98864,Excellent course really thank you for sharing this knowledge and learning,5
98865,Great!,5
98866,"I have looked at several courses on NodeJS on udemy, pluralsight, this one is far the best. Jogesh is awesome teacher goes into fundamentals and this is the best introductory course on NodeJS. I am doing my regular day job and I am taking the course on side, the length of the weekly class is longer and it is harder for me to finish the class every week, that is just me. Thanks a ton Jogesh.",5
98867,Amazing and very informative! Highly recommended!,5
98868,Pretty Good,4
98869,I enjoyed this course,5
98870,"While a lot of useful ground was covered, it was a constant struggle simply getting my environment to work properly - the entire specialisation needs to do a better job of getting users on a level playing field with better environment setup.",2
98871,for begginer is very easy and explicit.,5
98872,"Excellent teaching.First of all, i thank Dr.k.Muppalla for such wonderful teaching with good exercises.this course will help all those who want to learn about web services.",5
98873,Great course and great professor!,5
98874,"very great course with lots of new concepts also not very fast like another courses ,lots of examples there to try",4
98875,"I don't like the fact you have to pay 80 dollars just to unlock assignment submissions. The fact that other students have to grade each other is not worth the 80 dollars. Think of all the students that may attend the course will more than cover the server costs if it was 10$. Otherwise, the class so far is useful.",3
98876,"Excellent course for those who want to drive into nodeJS and mongoDB.Theory, practice and assignments are perfectly constructed and presented in a structured, informative way.For me, it is exactly the course I needed.Thank you,Nikita",5
98877,I liked it as a way to start developing a nodejs backend.I wished that it would have gone a bit deeper in some topics.,4
98878,Great Course!!,5
98879,"It's a good course that covers a good amount of rich material in a short amount of time.Wish there was some more explanation on certain plugins we are using outside of just 'this is what you do'. Course files would help quite a bit when completing assignments, especially with the amount we are modifying our local projects.",4
98880,"Thanks to Professor Muppala this course becomes very modern, useful and easy to understand!Enroll and have fun!",5
98881,Great course!,5
98882,great course. very complete and thorough.,5
98883,this is really helpful to me to develop my own web project. i wondered how nodejs operate with mongoDB. Thank you to professor and coursera.,5
98884,Thank you good course,5
98885,Excellent. Well structured and good balance between theory and practice.,5
98886,Great Course!!!!,5
98887,great introductory stuff to node js,4
98888,good course！！！！！！！,5
98889,Not a very good course. The assignments are not very clear. Could have done much more like integrating front-end etc in place of that loopback module. Was really disappointed with this one. Should have given 0 stars but gave 3 stars for Jogesh Muppala as he is my favourite teacher when it comes to MOOC,3
98890,Thanks to the instructor for the great course. The course gives the possibility to dive into node.js,5
98891,Amazingly charismatic teacher. :),5
98892,A good introductory course spanning full-stack server side development. I liked the structured flow of lessons and excercises.A great minus though is that this course has little to none focus on testing. While in the middle of this course I lack insight into testing strategies with node js.,4
98893,Pretty good course. I wouldn't be able to learn so much on my own.,5
98894,It's the best.,5
98895,Well designed and rich stuffed course,5
98896,Excellent course. Well structured and includes great information.,5
98897,What a awesome explanation.Like it ..Thank you very much providing the session with live examples.Very much useful course to get clear idea of the topic.,5
98898,Great course and great specialization!!!! I have learned a lot!!!!,5
98899,Amazing course! Prof. Muppala makes it very very to understand the concepts. Highly recommended to anyone who wants to understand the ways of Node.js/Express/MongoDB.,5
98900,"Highly recommend - the course is brilliant, and I tip my hat to the professor for his 'node' of genius. Well structured, well explained, well detailed. Thank you for this wonderful specialization!",5
98901,course and professor are great!,5
98902,"Till now, the course is really great!",5
98903,all right!,5
98904,"This series is superb, you can get from beginner to advanced level in fullstack web & mobile development if you religiously consume all the materials and teachings provided in this series. Professor Rogesh is an awesome instructor who spares no effort to provide us with consummate instructions.What's the best thing? You get a real, working products of your own when you finish this series. You will also get to deploy your product in the Capstone project and hence, I strongly recommend this specialization for those who are serious at developing a web product.",5
98905,"Excellent. Complex functionallity, simple explanations.",5
98906,"Pay to submit assignments, GG.All the stars goes to the prof.",2
98907,good course !!!,4

98915,I love the content of this course.,5
98916,Excelent experience of modern Marketing,5
98917,"Great content, I do not suggest to take the course in Spanish, there are some translation issues that can make complex the understanding.",4
98918,"EXCELENTE CURSO, OFRECE UNA VISIÓN PANORÁMICA SOBRE EL MARKETING, AHONDANDO EN TEMAS IMPORTANTES SOBRE MARKETING MIX, BRANDING, Y COMPORTAMIENTO DEL CONSUMIDOR",5
98919,Great course. Very interesting and engaging.,4
98920,If you spend some time through practicing basics later you can master much more complicated topics.Blind and drunk Kung fu master ... :),5
98921,Because if you can come through on the capstone then you really know what your actually studying.,5
98922,Slow and soft Work,4
98923,Great instructor!,4
98924,reallt good ! highly recommended !,5
98925,Great One.! A Skill Enhancement Course.!,5
98926,I became a better web developer,5
98927,Really good,5
98928,thanks!!,5
98929,"This is definitely a great class to help you understand the principles to web design in HTML, CSS, JS, and understanding how to host your web in the right way. I really enjoyed working on the capstone project with the students in class. The people online are helpful on reaching out to your questions and being able to give you some advice of how to improve your designs.I would definitely recommend anyone who is interested in a computer programing or web design career to take this class. It is a great way to help you get more knowledge to the web design world. Hope this survey helps.",5
98930,"I achieved much more then I intended. The course content is very well laid out, and is intriguing.",5
98931,"A good course, well organised and no stress at all.I love the way the presentation is done by Ma'am.Thanks a lot you and The mentors who helped us achieve this great course.I'm very excited to have another class with you. Have a great great future.",5
98932,"Just a perfect teacher, who gave me a power to believe in myself and tough me all about Web-Design in a very easy-going manner!",5
98933,Great course ...thanks to Professor DR. Van Lent and her team. I have learned a lot about Responsive Web Design and the need to take accessibility into account when undertaking web design.,5
98934,Excellent course that is very progressive and based on practice. Colleen Van Lent is a very good teacher who her videos are of excellent quality: a perfect mix between theory and practice.,5
98935,The course is very well structured and gives clear guidance through the project development stages.,5
98936,very good course),5
98937,"A comprehensive overview of web programming, good for a noob, or as a review whose previous web programming experience may have been limited to the national supercomputing consortium's free (now archived) HTML manual. The content of this specialization will get you up to speed quickly. As with all Coursera courses, it is up to you to unfold the concentrated content on your own time. This lecturer makes it easy to do so. I highly recommend this course!",5
98938,I like this!,5
98939,excellent work! the online office hours is a very good method!,5
98940,Love it!,5
98941,Have been waiting for this. It's a 5 star man,5
98942,very good course. It has helped me a lot to understand critical ruby on rails concepts.,5
98943,"Amazing course, i had complete Ruby on Rails tutorial by Michael Hartl and i was still doubtful about alot of things but i think this course has put me on the right path and now im really confident and i think i will go all the way, Johns Hopkins university courses are amazing, very good for learning. I highly recommend it to anyone wants to learn Ruby on Rails.",5
98944,"Very useful, nice practical asssignments",5
98945,Great course! A great help to put you on your feet with Ruby on Rails development!,5
98946,"Very intensive, a lot of work on assignments but at the end very happy to done this...",5
98947,"Totally unimpressed. Video lectures are terrible. Explanations are at best incomplete, usually confusing, sometimes incoherent. Instructor never gives an overview of the architecture/data flow/structure of Active Record or Action Pack, instead describes the syntax of a handful of functions. As a result you only get the most superficial understanding of the material. The graded assignments are just a regurgitation of the lectures and so don't require you to take a deeper dive into the material. In fact, in many cases the answers to the graded assignments are listed in the assignment immediately following the question.",1
98948,Seems tough...though interesting !!,4
98949,"I learned a lot from the course.The instructions of the last exercise could be less detailed, so as it would be more challenging",5
98950,"Learn a lot of new knowledge from this course. knowledge points clear, assignment workload OK. This is the good place to learn Active Record and Action Pack.",4
98951,Wonderful course. Thorough instructions with a great level of detail. Great assignments that reinforce the lessons. Would recommend to anyone wanting to learn about Ruby on Rails specifically or Web Development generally.,5
98952,"Do find something useful, even I am quite familiar with Rails. Good course!",5
98953,After this course you'll be able to develop a functional web app using Rails' build-in database. Now you can produce your own data using all the options Rails has to offer; that's nice because you don't depend on external API's to get the back-end stuffs. Recommended!,5
98954,"As good as Course 1, grate learning experience",5
98955,Very nice one. may be not the one for a beginner but help to gain some basics,4
98956,Could have been much better ....should have been a proper video tutorial,1
98957,very useful,5
98958,Great follow up course on Ruby programming!,5
98959,"Great program. Well structured, with lots of additional resources that make for easier self-study. Videos are just the right length to provide the knowledge without being too long and too filled with details. All in all, this is an excellent 2nd course in my Ruby on Rails Web Development skills development.",5
98960,Useful course for beginners to Rails world.,4
98961,"What is an application without a place to store and retrieve data. I have a moderate amount of experience with SQL from working with SQL Server and Oracle DB, so picking up this material was a natural extension of that experience to leverage a database for a full-featured application.",5
98962,The assignments took me much longer than the suggested 3 hours. Every task depends on having completed the previous task perfectly. My assignment in week 4 passed the end to end test perfectly on my local computer but failed the grader. I traced the problem back to a tiny typo that I made in week 2 assignment. (My heart sank when I saw I had to reuse my week 2 work in week 4 as I knew how much messing around I had done to get that one through the grader - I knew it would give problems)As there were a couple of mistakes in the course (for example if you follow the steps in assignment 3 correctly then the final rspec would give failures - obviously this wasn't picked up by lecturers) it creates confusion and doubt as to whether you have made the mistake or the tutors.The course content is good but the assignments need to be shorter and more forgiving of mistakes (i.e make the individual tasks independent of one another and pass if you get 80%). I am not sure if I will continue with the specialisation right now. It seems more suited to someone who is studying full time and not someone who is working who has limited spare time.,3
98963,Fantastic presentation material. By far above average.,5
98964,"Content of the course is great! But if you get stuck in a problem no one responds or guides you. For practice purpose just take the free version, paid version is not worth taking, as you will not get any additional guidance or support to do assignments when stuck.",1
98965,It was so helpful!I recommend this course.,5
98966,Quick and easy to understand lectures. I was able to pick up active record and action pack quickly!,4
98967,Very good course for basic web frame work .,5
98968,funny and challenging course!!,5
98969,Excellent course with clear and thorough explanations of Rails concepts. Highly recommend!,5
98970,It was so uneasy to get through this course. But I like it!,5
98971,The first two courses in this series have really rekindled my interest in software development after many years away from it. Kalman does a great job - the lectures are interesting and the assignments are challenging.,5
98972,"Great course for understanding Active Record and managing data in a rails app. As someone new to ruby on rails, I found some details were glossed over, and some explanations were vague. However, the assignments were very well structured and filled in any gaps I had from the lectures.",4
98973,This course is a pretty detailed analysis of Controller and View roles in MVC with all it's syntax and conventions but it's definitely require some additional material for students to find by themselves. Anyway quizes and assignments are amazing - very good practice even for a little bit more advanced students than complete beginners!,5
98974,good concept clear,5
98975,"Good overview, though sometimes hard to follow if you're a complete newbie",4
98976,A little challenging for Ruby beginners but extremely rewarding,5
98977,This is a well organized and excellent course.,5
98978,Again a very helpful course. Thanks very much.,5
98979,"Well explained content, though at times the presentation felt a little slow. Solid coding assignments that do a good job of reenforcing the course materials. A couple small topics weren't explained clearly but overall it's been a very informative class. Thanks for the knowledge!",4
98980,Amazing course!,5
98981,"Great course. It open ed up my eyes to how simple it can be to generate a workable MVC web application without having to dive too deep into the working of the application,",4
98982,An example of how a course should look like. It has everything you need to learn :1) good videos2) good materials3) a teacher that is active on the forum4) very well explained projects5/5 would recommend :DGoing of to listen third part of this specializations.,5
98983,Good tips for the double AA.,4
98984,"A nice continuation to course 1 of this specialization, deeper dive into RoR, among other things you will learn how to manipulate/display database data and how to authenticate/authorize users!",5
98985,"Excellent course. Great lectures, great instructor, and fun assignments. Looking forward to the next course in the specialization.",5
98986,Awesome course that took us to database learning and how they interact with rails application. A lot of stuff learned.,5
98987,Wonderful job of explaining rails development! Awesome!,5
98988,"Great course although I did struggle through the very last assignment. The first three were relatively ok, considering I'm new at this but they did take me longer than 3 hours to complete. The last one took about 3 days!That being said, if the rspec tests weren't being run in dev mode, it might have been quicker. I had to move ""ENV['RAILS_ENV'] ||= 'test'"" from rails_helper.rb to spec_helper.rb to get stuff working.Without my ruby on rails hubby, I'd have been lost!",3
98989,"Great gentle introduction to ActiveRecord, and by the end of the course you feel like you can create pretty much any webapp.",5
98990,"This course is awesome, even to who know a little about Ruby on Rails. There are much tips to help you develop a good application.",5
98991,Great intro to rails with Active record and action pack,5
98992,Very good course.The professor explains a lot from the framework and other concepts of web development.Very worth it!!,4
98993,"Not as strong a course as the first course in the specialization. The lectures glossed over some things, while the assignments were a little repetitive. Nevertheless, a solid class on using rails with relational databases.",4
98994,I really liked writing the authentication myself. I've relied on Devise (and will continue using it mostly) but really got an appreciation for what was going on.,5
98995,"Excellent introductory course now im using rails, heroku and git hub to create a simple web app thanks!",5
98996,Very interesting and very well presented!,5
98997,Very good course!,5
98998,Very well done. I was already familiar with the concepts taught in this course but I still learned some things which is nice.,5
98999,The course assignments is hard and takes lots of hours but are valuable to me as it systematically consolidates rails' components for me.,5
99000,Very practical course! Keep the good work.Thanks for your effort!,5
99001,"Smooth pace and each assignment related to further one is very helpful for understanding course material.while I think partial or helper should provide 2 or 3 extra example code in extra reading material to know when to use partial, when to use helper.",4
99002,Must Have course for every future RoR developer!,5
99003,bad instructor,1
99004,"Very informative, good material and explanation.",5
99005,Great course for intermediate level!,5
99006,"Excellent course, good combination of broad strokes and practical, specific tips.",5
99007,In this course I got new skills about the Ruby on Rails framework using the incredible Active Record ORM and the Action Pack. Great videos!,5
99008,"Awesome course, i have learned a lot about active records, rails database management, action pack, and so on. it's a very completed course.!",5
99009,It is a very good course!,5
99010,"Awesome! Learned a lot, and the instructor helped me promptly when I ran into an issue on the homework. Great class!",5
99011,"Good course overall, wish more topics were covered but it's OK.",4
99012,This course continues the Introduction with the same test-driven approach and delicious intensity of the material. Efforts to finish the course will be greatly rewarded.,5
99013,"Great Course, Great assignments and pace. Loved it.",4
99014,Just like the Course about the introduction to ruby this course has helped me to understand more Rails and the active record i really want to say : Thanks! to the professor who give me the opportunity to take this course :D From venezuela! Gracias mi pana :),5
99015,well done!thank you!,5
99016,great course,5

99026,"This tuto is excellent , the notes, the examples and the professor explain",5
99027,Very good and resumed analysis of ActiveRecord and ActionPack,5
99028,really superior course. thank you,5
99029,"You can learn a lot, but I do not think it is aimed at beginners.",5
99030,Enough to start I hope:),5
99031,Great explanation of not so easy to understand concepts. Lecturer provides good example that can help material better and see how what you've learned can be applied to real world scenarios.,5
99032,Thank you Prof. Kalman Hazins. I like your course very much. It is useful and filled with a lot of information. Thank you for your hard work. I'm really appreciated it. Hope you have more courses on Coursera.,5
99033,Great Material and clear example !!!,5
99034,"awesome course, nails the basics!",5

99045,A very comprehensive course which is a great introduction to wind energy.,5
99046,"Hi, The course is a nice introduction to the wind energy.The exercises are well balanced and sometimes challenging.I would to suggest a final exam where you have to use all the knowledge learnt along the 5 weeks, and perform a pre-project of wind turbine and install it in wind farm. This way, by doing your own design the concepts are seens as a whole.",4
99047,"Very interesting course, well organized, with clear lessons",5

99049,"perfect bases knowledge for wind energy, covering all parts of wind energy industry and science.",5
99050,"it was good, bery illustrative. But it need to be enhansed in some ways.",4
99051,"I had initially started the course in order to gain insight more into the role of wind energy, the operations, the components and financing behind it. The course was a little heavy on actual mechanics and turbine output calculations. Would've enjoyed a more descriptive course with more emphasis on the financing and operational side as well as how the wind facilities fit into the grid. That said, it does provide a great basic overview of the concept and the mathematical side is still useful, particularly if interested in the engineering aspect.",3

99072,It is a complete course.,5
99073,"This was a great course for me. I tried to get a general overview of Wind Energy and the course covered quite a lot. For sure the course can scratch on the surface of the topic only and can't go deep into detail but there are sessions where one has to sit down and think and understand the theory. - Lectures are well structured, teachers know what they talk about and presentation and links for additional materials are good. I recommend this course for those who want an insight in Wind Energy.",5
99074,I like this course! Everything is clear ...Thank you so much,5
99075,excellent point of view about this kind of energy and general aspects related to that,5

99077,Great,5
99078,"I've enjoyed this course, it was such a great one",5
99079,"The course gives the basics about every thing you have to know about wind energy. There are many instructors participating, showing the effort in giving a good corse with experts in each matter",5
99080,"good intermediate course that goes a little below the surface, and offers more than the absolute basics.",4
99081,"The course was challenging but extremely rewarding and enriching. I enjoyed the content, and eagerly look forward to more courses in wind energy from DTU! Thanks!",5
99082,"If you want to get an idea about the wind energy and the whole process, except installation, it is really useful and complete.",5
99083,First I like to say I completed all the assignments and this took time. I watched all the videos and read the pdf files. So there is a sense of accomplishment. Hence I gave the course a 5 star rating.If you are an engineer or from the physics field you may want to take up this short 5 week course. It introduces you to various areas of wind energy engineering. It may be enough for you to take up a wind engineering textbook to complete a self study. Good Luck.,5
99084,wind energy more useful for energy field because it is continuous source.and DTU is provide nice platform for students..,5
99085,"This course gave me a very nice overview to different aspects of the wind turbines, which is necessary for everyone who wants to work in this field. It would be better if this course continues with some more courses at higher level, focused on different subjects with more details. Probably for the future courses.",4

99104,Tough course but at least I have the impression that I know wind energy better,5
99105,This course is excellent with a lot of real time data analysis and excellent presentation. I am very excited and am looking forward to finish this course successfully.,5
99106,"The course is well structured, and the contents are exposed clearly. Probably one of the main problems of the subject ""Wind Energy"" itself, is it covers many disciplines (Aerodynamics, Mechanics and Machinery, Structural design, Electricity and Grid connection, Financial aspects...), so a 5-Week course had to be quite superficial to cover each of this aspects minimally. For my expectations it was a little bit too simple, but mostly the quizzes were too easy. The hints after the quizz questions were solving the questions and avoiding the beautiful part of the quizzes: playing with the formulae, and interiorizing it.All in all it was a nice, enjoyable course, but sadly I feel I didn't get deep enough in many of the treated subjects, even for an introductory course.",3
99107,The course was very good and the concepts were explained well. But I felt the material could have been more in-depth on the subjects.,4
99108,"Very Good , Medium-level for an Indian Student",5
99109,This is a very good course for those who want to learn about wind turbines. Assignments are very practical and provide everything to understand the theories.,5
99110,"This course gives a begginner's insight on Wind Energy. The course addresses the basic science behind its main aspects. However, it lacks depth on key issues and could be a bit more advanced (or there could be at least a sequel for people who are very interested on the field)",5
99111,This course is amazing! Everything is explained carefully and afterwards you can check your knowledge in quizzes. The course is both for people who never before had anything to do with Wind Energy and for those who just want to refresh their knowledge. I recommend it strongly:),5
99112,The perfect course that help you understand wind energy with all facts,5
99113,Understanding the forces on wind blade is thread like clear with help of prototype. Electrical systems working clearly explained and was from basic to the recent one used.,5

99131,"Very good course. The modules are very well presented. The quizzes are adapted to the exposed level. During the video expositions, spot questions are very good to help for newbies.",5
99132,This course has fantastically presented the basic knowledge of all the sectors related to the wind turbine energy. Lecture materials and exercises all were very much enriched. I want to convey my thanks to the course coordinators.,5
99133,"It is a good course for all people who want to know more aobut this resource. In opinion each chapter could be a course in order to make a especialization and, about all, one course dedicated to software (wasp... windpro...) would give 5 stars. A good introduction course, i hope it helps me to find a new job... :(",4
99134,"Great Course, fundamental but gives a clear picture of wind energy technology from all perspectives. Hoping that more detailed courses of wind turbine will be delivered in the future.",5
99135,"Love the downloadable videos, slides & transcript files.Suggestion: better to add ""answer model' file after every quiz as a downloadable one.",5
99136,"Excellent course. I suggest that in a few quizzes you were asking to get the numbers off the slides in the video. It is very difficult to read the numbers off the video. Can you instead add the slides in the quiz PDF file? All the information required to answer the quizzes should be in the PDF file.The course material was very good. The problem sets were very good too because of real life data. The rigor of courses was average. I can understand why you do not want to make the course more rigorous. However, it would help advanced engineering students to go through a more rigorous course.",4
99137,Excellent course on the fundamentals of wind energy. I thoroughly recommend it.,5
99138,"very great course, if you are new in wind energy industry, you must take this course.",5

99162,Very important course! technical and financial knowledge.,5
99163,I am very happy this course is available. It would have been a great help 10 years ago as I started working in the wind energy industry.,5
99164,Brilliant !! MasterClass !! This course will definitely full up all my needs about wind energy.,5
99165,"It's globally a nice course, although you have to keep in mind that it is more like an introduction to the topic rather than a real, full course. I was quite frustrated from time to time that some important and difficult points are not really justified or explained in details, but just given as assumption or obvious concept: If you are familiar with that concept, you will be fine (but probably won't learn that much), while if you are not you will be probably lost. I mean, for a free course this is already a pretty nice job, and I think it is worth to take this course. I would be for sure ready to pay something to get a longer and more detailed course on this topic.",3
99166,"Enjoyed the course so much, planning to do it again later this year!",4
99167,Great course for basic knowledge.,5
99168,good course,5
99169,Great introductory level course for undergraduates.More emphasis on commercial application with basic phenomenon of fluid flow and structural mechanics given in the course which could have been upgraded to 2 weeks more of special lectures.Overall a nice experience in solving problems and undertaking tricky scenarios in assignments.,4
99170,"Fantastic course, I enjoyed every module and the assignments. My only comment is for there to be full working answers to Assignments available afterwards so that people can understand where they went wrong if they did not get a question correct. I really enjoyed the aerodynamic section and look forward to more advance modules if any do happen to put out. Also from doing this module I defiantly want to learn much more about the wind Industry.",5
99171,"Excellent course, but not so easy for beginners.",4
99172,"Excellent course! Competent teachers and teaching easy to learn.Thanks, all teachers.",5
99173,A pretty good introductory course but not much more. I really hope to see it followed up by a more advanced version! Thanks for all the help!,4

99186,"The instructors have prepared very carefully. Interesting examples are given in the lectures, which inspire me very much.",5
99187,"Incredible the way Professor Bushee engages you and makes a dynamic video. Accounting is very tedious, but he makes it way better and challenges you every video and exam that happens to be very fulfilling when you pass them.",5
99188,"a very helful and very very well developed course, I enjoyed it",5
99189,"It is a bit ambiguous the way it teaches a way to apply accountability, sometimes it is sometimes is not, it all depend on the circunstances.I recommend try to focus in the fundamentalsonly.",3
99190,Such a fun and interesting course!,5
99191,"AMAZING course!!!!! Lectures are well presented, I liked the extra tutorials and the assignment are really fun to do. If you have only a slight interest in skeletons, archeology or maybe even forensics, I would definitely recommend",5
99192,"Incredibly informative, builds upon itself, and gives ample opportunity for application in case study assignments.",5
99193,"This is a wonderful course for someone who knew absolutely nothing about osteoarchaeology or that osteoarchaeology is even a field! The lectures were stimulating and full of information - so much was new to me that I listened to all of them twice. The general format was perfect - a very good combination of lectures, discussions (the teaching assistants' information videos were very helpful), interviews, quizzes and homework assignments. The homework assignments were particularly useful in in helping me to absorb all of the information presented in the lectures, forums, etc. I thoroughly enjoyed this class. Thank you so much for creating it.",5
99194,"I Like so much this course, because it has helped me a lot, and I have learnt a lot of things to do my work, because I am archaeologist and I work with bones.",5
99195,"Excellent introduction to topic, well presented and very interactive. Quite in-depthAssignments were meaningful and directly related to materials presented. Looking forward to doing more study in this area!",5
99196,"Excellent introductory course on bones. There is a bit of writing involved for weekly assignments, which can take time, but for the most part everything you need to complete them is within lectures. Very responsive forum moderation.",5
99197,Very enjoyable. Cool information and the assignments really force you to think critically about your reasoning.,5
99198,"I enjoyed this course so much! I learned a lot and I will looking for more courses in the same field.The lectures, extra videos, and the invited guests explaining a bit about their work were some of the best I've seen in a MOOC. Perhaps I missed my calling when I didn't study osteoarcheology.This is an awesome course and I'd love to see a followup course.Congratulations on a fantastic job, Dr. Andrea Waters-Rist and team!",5
99199,Awesome course =),5
99200,Loved this course. Allows you to go into more detail if you wish. Friendly lecturer. Facinating subject.,5
99201,"Very interesting course... but very exigeant! One evaluated subject per week, it's hard and if you don't give the necessary time to complete this work, you'll lose your time and waste money!",4
99202,Good info,5
99203,"Please we need pdf printable ""booklets” of slides (no headshots “and use PALE backgrounds) under downloads below the video screen. I love MOOCs that do this for us to help integrate knowledge. Thanks so much. The course content is very good - I have taken bricks and mortar forensic classes as well as a Forensics MOOC out of China and yours is comparable. But please the downloadable slides? Thanks so muchcom/"",[g,=�o��",4
99204,"I really recomend this course, It provides good examples, information and practice test. I think it is necessary for any archaeologist or person realated to this field",5
99205,"I learn a lot about ancient skeleton and also about my own, in very enjoyable lessons!",5
99206,The peer-review rubrics need adjustments.. it's very hard to grade anyone this way. Especially when the answers are just wrong.The staff/teachers/instructors CAN BE A LOT MORE INVOLVED ON THE FORUM!,1
99207,"Assignments are extremely helpful in fully understanding the topic. Lectures help in completing assignments, especially with the optional videos that explain in greater detail how to examine specific bones and interpret certain patterns.",5
99208,Great course....learned a lot and had fun.,5
99209,"This course is very interesting with well thought-out content that involves the student very actively from the first lesson. The assignments are challenging but also very exciting. I consider is a unique innovation in MOOC courses. The professor give excellent information interspersed with interesting case studies. Unfortunately, there was no interaction in my iteration of the course, or any apparent involvement whatsoever, from any TA's or mentors. All questions remained unanswered (except by other students), and frustrated calls for help and advice were ignored. The majority of the course's mark (60%) is determined by fellow students using a rubric which leaves little true 'wiggle room' between pass and fail marks. The mystery cases on which we worked during the course were never 'resolved' or explained in any way, which would have been nice after the effort that went into them. I would recommend the content of the course 'for fun' but if anyone is looking for an accurate assessment of material learned, try another course.",2
99210,"Very accessiblein terms of difficulty, very interesting case studies and thorough explanations. This complemented the practical summer course I had done a few years ago.",5
99211,"Absolutely a fantastic and brilliant experience, one in which I would recommend to anyone choosing a history, archaeology, anthropology or anatomy related career path. I learned so much and gained both a new insight in studying the human anatomy and a new interest in what I would like to study further for my career.",5
99212,"This is a very good course, I have really enjoyed taking this course, and I learned a lot. I have already put to use what I have learned in this course, into another course I am taking. The only criticism I have of this course is the grading system. The peer review grading of the papers lacks a lot to be desired. People give you arbitrary grades without giving any feed back. You can submit a graduate level paper, and be graded off by someone with a high school education. I feel this problem needs to be corrected before I take another course from Leiden University.",4
99213,"I really enjoyed learning from this course. It was diverse and exciting. The assignments were interesting, and makes the student feel as though you are truly an osteo-archaeologist who needs to 'solve the mystery' of the skeleton. The only downside of this course is the peer-reviewed assignment. The peer review is done by multiple-choice from 1 to 5 for five 'aspects' of your submission and many 'peers' do not leave any comment to provide feedback for improvement. So, if you didn't pass the assignment the first time, you might not have a clue what it is that you should improve for the second submission. Apart from the fact that you are reviewed by peers (= not specialists) who might be wrong themselves, it is very annoying that you are not able to learn from your mistakes. Perhaps this course could improve on this point by making it obligatory for peers to add a comment.",4
99214,"I took this course to find out what osteoarchaeology was all about. Excellent, excellent course! Well planned, laid out and , and very interesting. I have learned a lot. Thank you!!!",5
99215,"Very interesting course, a lot of information very well explained and showed. Congratulations to all the team that make this course possible !! Thank you very much",5
99216,"Very informative, a good grounding in the subject, I really felt like I gained a lot of valuable knowledge on the subject that will help me in future endeavors. Very well put-together and organized.",5
99217,"This is an excellently well presented course that is informative, interesting and challenging. Well worth engaging with.",5
99218,"I think it was a great introduction to the field and I hope to learn more in the near future. Thanks to all the people that helped create it. My only criticism is the lack of understanding by the other students when they grade others papers. Giving low scores without giving any feedback is not helpful.All in all, I had fun taking this course.",5
99219,"I thoroughly enjoyed this class! I've completed about 6 courses so far and while I've found all of them very informative this is the first one that I was sorry to see the end. Maybe Professor Waters-Rist and her team could conduct another Osteoarchaeology class introducing techniques not covered in this course. Regardless, great job and thank you so much for allowing me to learn more about this fascinating field!",4
99220,A truly stellar experience. The course structure is very well thought off and the information given just about right for a short seminar. I would love a sequel with the topics that we did not cover. Thank you very much for this educational experience.,5
99221,"The course has been very informative, the mystery cases we had to solve challenging.The topic and how the team approached it was great, but there have been some downsides too. The transcripts were full of mistakes as done with a voice recognition software and obviously not double checked (which is bad for non-native speakers like me), and some of the material given in the mystery cases would have needed some further explanation on how to interpret them. Especially for the ones without any previous knowledge - like me - there should be more information or a help desk. Peer review is another issue. I am still not quite sure what I have done wrong, as there was no feedback. And, sometimes I really didn't know how to give feedback myself, as I didn't know if I was right or wrong with my analysis. If relying on peer review only, there should be solutions handed in after you have submitted so that you can learn from your mistakes and are able to review the others correctly.All in all I have learned loads within these 5 weeks and I will definitely come back on another course. It has been fun and challenging!",4
99222,"It was short, therefore it touched all the matters very superficially, however it was definitely a course on an academic level and it gave solid basis for future studies, and it's not just a rhetoric figure. Thank you, I am proud of myself, that I passed.",5
99223,"Positive: Very interesting and informative lectures and subject matter.Negative: Fellow ""students"" who have no knowledge of the subject (other than what they themselves are learning) are required to submit case studies for ""peer review"" by other students who have no more knowledge of the subject than they do. These case studies are heavily weighted and if the person is reviewed negatively (for whatever reason), they must resubmit it never knowing why they were given low scores or what the correct answer should have been. No instructor assistance is given. Huge turn-off for me and many of my fellow students. I want to withdraw (drop) this class and take another with more clearly drawn parameters.",1
99224,"Amazing course... what set this apart from other online learning experiences is the highly informational and instructional video content. This course was developed thoughtfully, allowing for various learning styles to be successful. Students are able to enjoy the experience of learning, and method engagement required is both fascinating and educational. The lead instructors of this course are highly engaging and present material with perfect clarity and purpose. I highly recommend this course and will be looking for more from this university and the authors.",5
99225,"This is a nice effort, and it obvious how hard everyone has worked. There are too many presumptions presented as 'facts', though, and too much certainty about research issues that lots of debate is still going around. So, good work, but unless the course is supposed to attract only ignorants and people that haven't been in contact with 'science', some of the instructors act a bit 'I know it all' and that is how it is, although no-one does yet. Sorry to discover this spirit in here.",1
99226,"While the course is very interesting, I found the peer review process unsatisfying. I did not enjoy grading others without knowing if I was right. Grading a fellow student on their accuracy when I don't know if they are actually wrong is something I never want to do again. After completing the course, I had hoped to learn if any of my assignments were actually correct. I am disappointed in the outcome.",1
99227,Great. I am confident that soon there will be new and more advanced coursesthat can perform registration to perform them.,5
99228,"I thoroughly enjoyed the course, and learned a lot, though there were some technology 'glitches' to overcome.I would recommend that the administrators, for future courses, ask students to upload their assignments as PDFs, as this would enable non-Microsoft/Open Office etc. users to review the assignments directly in their browser, rather than having to download the files, convert them, then dispose of them :)",4
99229,"Love the content, tutorials etc. but the peer review way of marking is not fair.I unfortunately withdrew because of this. I & others were never going to succeed. This is because peers who are also having problems, not sure of what they are doing are the ones marking the assessments.Not giving refunds after the 2 week cut off is also unfair. This must be how you make your money for these free courses.",5
99230,"great class, please repeat it!",5
99231,"This is a great course, it provides you with all detail information about AngujarJS and it goes beyond by providing you with real life application. I hope Coursera could have a Front-end Specialization including TypeScript AngularJS 2, and React",5
99232,"The lecturer teaches in a very clear and comfortable manner.I was very grateful, thank you!",5
99233,"Best Course to be preferred for learning AngularJS from scratch. Mr. Yaakov, course instructor, has done a great job ! A big Thumbs Up to the course. Looking forward to many more courses coming up by Mr. Yaakov Chaikin <3",5
99234,Excellent course. Very well organized and all angular major themes are covered. Exercices are very usefull. I recommend this course !,5
99235,"i can not unenroll this course, it's very terrible",1
99236,"Recently while working on an AngularJS App at work, I was able to recall so many core concepts that I learned in this project and which go a long way in making your code more modular and scalable. I still go back to the lectures sometimes just to revise some concepts or reasoning (like why use IIFE in AngularJS?). Also, Prof. Yaakov is very funny and keeps all the lectures interesting so you get to have some fun while learning as well.",5
99237,Awesome course,5
99238,This is an amazing course for anyone who wishes to dive into the front end development using Angular JS framework. The course takes a dive into all important aspects and explains them in a very easy analogical approach which is quite easy to understand and perceive.,5
99239,"I learned a lot in this course while having fun. The instructor delve into some advanced concepts in a clear way, which helped me to better understand AngularJS framework. Thanks for making this course.",5
99240,"Awesome sessions, pretty crisp and clear teaching.",5
99241,An outstanding course to learn AngularJS effectively and develop a solid understanding of how and why to build SIngle Page Web Applications.,5
99242,"This course is taught very well, and I'm now at my ease with AngularJS. Thanks a lot Mr Yaakov...",5
99243,Fun and interesting course.,5
99244,Excellent! Really helped me a lot. Thanks yakov :) May you get lot more cookies in your life :P,5
99245,very good and very nice and very difficult for me,5
99246,Educational and fun!,5
99247,"The best course for AngularJS that i found, really good!",5
99248,"Great course, where the great teacher that is Yaakov not only explains the ""How"" but also and most importantly, the ""Why"" of AngularJS. The course is very comprehensive and goes in depth not only AngularJS but also good practices of web development (i.e. Git, unit testing) and design architectures. And although the course in itself is quite dense and challenging, Yaakov is really entertaining and clear in his explanations. Great course overall, I highly recommend it.",5
99249,"Good. But presentation is not satisfactory.However, thanks a lot for this course :)",4
99250,That course is awsome. I've lerned so much. Also I'll buy some cookies for the next course.,5
99251,Very useful,5
99252,A good thing about this course is that the course material are up to date enough and you wont come into many of issues that even professionals might get stuck in while they're updating to higher versions.,5
99253,This is awesome... I recommend it to all,5
99254,very positive and motivational course,5
99255,This course is really a knowledge bank for AngularJS. It made my life really easy when I was facing AngularJS interviews.,5
99256,nice and so cool in prof,5
99257,First of all I want to thank the author of this course in investing his time sharing knowledges about this JS framework. The course helped me to better understand the mechanism of Angular framework.,5
99258,I highly recommend this course for web dev beginners. Compared to other online materials this course provides much deeper understanding of the technologies taught and is a good starting point.,5
99259,A very nice course!,5
99260,Great for every developer that wants to learn AngularJS and understand the principles behind this framework.,5
99261,It was fun to learn a language which i considered to be difficult.,5
99262,"After making several attempts to learn Angular on my own, I finally learnt it with this course. An excellent course on Angular with all the concepts well explained. I had to go through a few lectures again to get a proper understanding but the course is really very well done. This made me also take up the HTML, CSS and JS course as well. I heartily recommend this course to everyone.",5
99263,"Awesome course! I really liked the way Prof. Yaakov Chaikin has structured the course, very informative and very interactive. Thanks to Prof. Yaakov. I would definitely recommend this course.",5
99264,Really great course that goes into detail about what happens behind the scenes with AngularJS so that you understand it better.,5
99265,Good... Perfect for who needs Complete Understanding,5
99266,"Great course! I found it extremely helpful that the 'why and why not' as well as the 'what happens behind the scene in Angular' was also addressed. Furthermore, the practical application in the last week was very helpful to breach the gap between isolated tasks and a real world problem.",5
99267,"Awesome course! I really liked Mr. Chaikan's previous course on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript basics because of the engaging style and his focus on the why in addition to the how, and this course has not disappointed. Mr. Chaikan makes the course fun to go through!",5
99268,"For beginners it's a 5 star course, once explains a lot of really too basic information and the instructor is more like a buddy than a teacher.Intermediates will literally fall in sleep, because of the excess of basic explanations and no intermediate or advanced explanation at all.As an Advanced, this course disappointed, not only because of lack of important information that not even in forums was answered, but it depends too much of the good will of mentors assistents.One big fall in this course is that's only in video, so no option to do it while in motion, like in a bus or any other noisy place.A bigger one is that's totally dependent of others students to give the grade, so you stay hostage of others and the instructor or mentors do not care about it.The biggest fall is that you will always pass it, once you can try some many times as you want, so eventually, you will pass, so the grade is just formal, not serious.The good side of the course, is that it seems to be very completed, so you will learn all the contents you need to work with AngularJS.",3
99269,Thanks a lot!!,5
99270,Great course! I learned a lot. Thanks to the instructor!,5
99271,I learned a lot of things about AngularJS and Javascript.,5
99272,Very Helpfull,5
99273,"Yaakov is awesome! Complicated material for those who have not had any experience in the area, but Yaakov helps make it more approachable with his humor.",5
99274,An excellent way to learn Angular...theory & practice.,5
99275,"This course hava a high quality content, includes good practices, i'm really happy with this. I arrived at the course barely knowing the angular bases, now I have solid bases to undertake challenges and projects.",5
99276,"Analytical, methodical with several examples.Worth a try.Thanks for the knowledge",5
99277,"Great course, with awesome lecturer Yaakov Chaikin!!!",5
99278,"Very detail explanation of the essence of AngularJS 1.x, which makes it easy to follow",5
99279,"Another excellent course from Yaakov Chaikin, an incredibly thorough teacher who explains everything in the clearest of ways, I would recommend anything he teaches. He makes AngularJS easy!",5
99280,Excellent course! Everything is very well explained and the examples are great!,5
99281,A practical and funny way to learn and understand how Angular works,5

99286,good and valuable course,5
99287,Great course! I enjoyed it very much and learned a ton. Highly recommended.,5
99288,"Really good course! Absolutely no ""water"" in lections, cuz Yaakov pro and talking only about lection theme...and cookies. It's a step by step course which will teach you all base aspects of angularJS in clear and a bit funny manner.",5
99289,"Great course! It's very helpful even for programmers, who is familiar with angular, but want to improve their skills",5
99290,Amazing course!,5
99291,Great course,5
99292,Great Course for software professionals who already know other languages like Java and wants to learn UI,5
99293,"A must have startup course in single page application development, in order to followchanging trends!",5
99294,"Prof. Yaakov Chaikin is a talented mentor. His teaching is so much more than a typical case-based 'training' with 'illustration' of specific examples, as he explores the underlying architecture and design foundations of the subject he presents. In addition, he has excellent presentation skills, that make his lectures enjoyable and easy to follow. I highly recommend this course.",5
99295,"Although the course did not cover all of the AngularJS framework, it seemed to cover all of the key technologies with great skill. The instruction was very well prepared and presented and the assignments were challenging so that they were a good learning experience as well.",5
99296,Great course!!! I learned a lot!!!,5
99297,Absolutely awesome in all ways,5
99298,Yaakov is very easy to follow along with and the course examples help illustrate some difficult-to-understand topics. I hope they update to Angular 2 in the near future.,5
99299,Very good to learn angular from the start,5
99300,Brilliant explanation and presentation is so interesting .Keep it up .,5
99301,Incredibly good. If you want to learn Angular this is the way to go.,5
99302,"It's great tutorials to learn the concept of AngularJS. It can be free if you dont have amount of money to purchase. Thank you, Yaakov :D",5
99303,"This is an awesome course.. All the what's, how's and why's are explained in an impeccable manner! I got a really quick hands on on the technology! Thanks a bunch!",5
99304,Great course!,5
99305,Best Course For Angular JS that I found.,5
99306,This is an absolutely fantastic course. Very enjoyable and engaging.,5
99307,"Detailed, interesting and exciting, Prof Yakov Chaikin did a fantastic job in delivering a load of insight and info in such a enjoyable manner. And after completing three courses in Coursera I can confidently say, no one can match the quality and dedication of the courses available here. This site is top class in online tutorial.",5
99308,"Excellent course! One of the best I have had on Coursera, owing to its completeness on the subject. My only complaint--and this is a nit-pick: sometimes the instructor labors points a bit. But that's OK: it adds clarity to hear details repeated every time the subject comes up. There's a lot of information and it is easy to forget something after the fact.If you take this course, you will enjoy it. Yaakov's examples are much more fun than the ubiquitous ATM machine or music collection. He knows how to take some of the bite out of what could become onerous material.",5
99309,Great course! It is so interesting and useful. Weeeeee!,5
99310,"Once again congratulations, Yaakov and JHU team! Amazing course! I learned *a lot* on it! =]",5
99311,"This is the first time I have finished an online course, and after this I feel I am able to do more. Yaakov's presentation makes it possible for me to finish it (while taking care of a baby!). The teaching material is well organised, step by step. For each topic, the theory is clearly presented first( but just enough to start an example) and then explained by coding examples. A brief summary of the theory will be made at the end so you get a chance to re-think about it. And since this course is about a framework, he doesn't just show you how to use it, but also explains how some functionalities are achieved by the framework. He even tries to explain why uses this framework, or any framework at all in the beginning, which may seem obvious but actually not, at least according to my experiences. Also, a most fun and brilliant part of this course is that he uses various kinds of ""he loves cookies"" examples throughout this course. They are REALLY fun and catching!",5
99312,"Very good learning experince. Clear slides, very good explanations and summary at the end of video lessons.",5
99313,"After hitting my head everywhere, I'm finally understanding AngularJS",5
99314,"Yaakov does an excellent job with this course, really boiling down the difficult concepts behind Angular into digestible components. I like his approach of not only teaching Angular concepts, but also putting them in context of more broad design patterns (such as MVVM) and principles (such as unit testing). Great course overall, well done Johns Hopkins team!",5
99315,"awesome course, super instructor.",5
99316,The content is so in-depth and applicable. Examples and assignments are well made to enrich me as a computer science graduate.,5
99317,Great course.,5
99318,"Very good course on AngularJS, presented in a very clear way. I learnt much.",5
99319,Very good course. I knew nothing about angularJS before and now I'm at least familiar with it. Yaakov explains things in an easy to understand way.,5
99320,"I wish I could give more than 5 stars! This is an excellent course for getting familiar with Angular JS and Yaakov does a fantastic job in keeping you engaged and chuckling along the way. It has to be noted that this course is probably not suitable for someone without any programming experience. You should at least be somewhat familiar with HTML, JavaScript and some previous exposure to MVVM wouldn't hurt. If you now nothing about CSS you can still take this course as it is not about making the website looking all nice and pretty.",5
99321,"Awesome course! The weekly tasks are challenging in a good way, the teacher is funny and informative, and there's so much to learn. Also, watch out for cookies :-) Thank you so much for this course! My AngularJs 1.x skills went from zero to hero!",5
99322,"Excellent material, The course is well organized and the instructor has done an amazing job in explaining key concepts with real time examples and also made it fun to learn which is not an easy task.Professor Yaakov, you are amazing. I wish I could send you lot of cookies :).",5
99323,"This course rocks. It is simply fantastic. Good balance practice vs. theory. A bit intensive if compared with other Coursera courses, but it's worth the money!",5
99324,"Very expressively explained. I like the way that you explain it by showing us what you are doing as well. In that way, it is easy for me to grasp the contents of the lecture. Thank you for the course.",5
99325,Got very good understanding of Angular 1 basics,5
99326,"Great course, thank you! It is much more easier to learn something new when someone draws your attention on really important things and explains some unobvious details, especially when he or she is such an exciting teller like Yaakov Chaikin! Moreover, I managed to build my own AngularJS application in parallel to the course tasks, which helped me a lot to understand the materials much deeper.",5
99327,Excelent course! I really recomend it. I have learned and enjoyed a lot these weeks. Special thanks to Yaakov. You're a master.,5
99328,Awesome Course helped me a lot with basics of Angular JS,5
99329,A must do course for any developer who wants to know the in and out of Angular js! Taught me many things! Thanks a lot Yaakov! Hope you get many more cookies :p !!!,5
99330,awesomethank's for this course,5
99331,"The course is really well done but unfortunately it's related to Angular v1.It is very useful to understand how Angular2 works, so i recommend it!",4
99332,Great way to know and learn Angular JS (Y),5
99333,"I highly recommend this course. Yaakov explains everything really well, even for people that are not very good at front end applications.",5
99334,Professor was passionate!,5
99335,Great Course! Very lucky to have a Great Instructor such as Yaakov Chaikin Sir for this course.,5
99336,Very good course. Thank you Yaakov. You are the best!,5
99337,"Simply the best Angular learning resource I have used. It doesn't only explain how to use Angular, but how it works and the underlying JS related concepts. Very well explained and full of illustrative examples.",5
99338,"Excelent course, I hope for AngularJS2 or 4 ;)",5
99339,Excellent course subject and an outstanding teacher.,5
99340,"This course is a great walk through guide not only for AngularJS, but also for some general software development best practices. The content is clear and easy to understand even though it does deep dive into several topics (for the good). Last but not least, the presenter found a great sweet spot between a super serious, yet boring lecture and a super cool presentation that doesn't actually teach you anything.",5
99341,"Excellent course, telling also ""why"" part!",5
99342,Professor Yaakov has made a great comprehensive course on Angular 1.5.8. It has not just augmented my angular knowledge but also made me learn some key features Iike components in the best way possible!I would highly recommend taking this course to my friends who are interested in learning!,5
99343,Covers all aspects of Angular JS with many examples.,5
99344,Very good teacher.,5
99345,One of the best courses I've attended! Well worth your time!,5
99346,very good course for angular js.,5
99347,"Finally a perfect learning course for AngularJS. Yaakov is one of the best teachers. Plus, you will love cookies!",5

99349,Great teacher Yakoov!,5
99350,"Terrific, accessible approach with clear and concise examples and lectures. Thanks for an excellent learning experience!",5
99351,Great course,5
99352,"Once again, Prof Chaikin has hit the ball out of the park in terms of design (very hands-on!) of lessons and delivery of content. The painstaking attention to detail, intuition about particular pitfalls for new learners (and more proficient ones too, in fact) and of course, the self-deprecating humor all contribute to making this actually pretty advanced course a whole lotta fun!And yes, like any really good teacher, Yakov feels the need to delve into theoretic niceties that most wouldn't. My background is that of an enthusiast programmer. Now I feel I have a good idea of what software engineering is about.",5
99353,I have learnt a lot of basics about AngularJS with this course. It was the perfect introduction.Prof. Yakov is very funny and make each lesson very enjoyable meanwhile he teaches the concepts very clearly.Thanks and I hope to assist to another course of yours.Best regards,5
99354,"Excelent Course , gives focus not only on the Syntax but also on the structuring and deep understanding on the things going on.",5
99355,Grate course for those who want to learn single page web applications.,4
99356,"Superb course I have ever seen in my life before, content became very interesting, informational and useful.",5
99357,Very nice course,5
99358,"This course is an amazing starting point for newcomers to the world of Javascript frameworks, in particular - Angularjs. Although primary focus is on Angular, Yaakov does great job explaining motivation behind chosen solutions. The course is exceptionally well structured which helps you understand material quickly and with ease. Yaakov Chaikin is a great teacher who spent great deal of time making this course fun and enjoyable to watch, giving all the necessary details in a very easy to remember form. Programming assignments really well thought and helps you to grasp major concepts of the framework not only from theoretical perspective, but with important ""hands-on"" experience. Finally, the author of the course goes deeper into software engineer career and recommends books like ""Soft Skills"" which in my opinion can give you a lot of realistic insights on the industry. Would love to continue watching courses made by Yaakov Chaikin and if you didn't join this course yet you should definitely give it a try! :-)",5
99359,"Wonderful job! Beautiful course structure and very engaging ,interesting assignments!",5
99360,"Great course. It goes at a pretty stiff rate but its gives a good grounding in Angular JS. The presenter Yaakov, presents all the concepts in a clear, concise manner.",5
99361,Thanks Yaakov providing such a nice course on SPA with AngularJS. Really appreciated.,5
99362,It is a great course!,5
99363,very well structured and enjoyable course! love it!,5
99364,For me it is the best course so far on coursera.,5
99365,"Having taken a lot of computer science courses by coursera, I can confirm this course is in the top two most valuable investments of my time/money along with Martin Odersky's scala course.I am an experienced java back-end developer, but have never worked in the front-end. And yet I found the material in this course very easy to follow. This is up to the teacher's talent to present the basic concepts with exceptional clarity, in the correct order and depth. Now, I am waiting for Yaakov to give a course about Angular 2!If you are a back-end developer and want to do your first step to front-end development this course is a must!",5
99366,Very nice Course with the relevant set of coding examples and exercises.,5
99367,Excellent course! A lot of topics and examples explained very well!,5
99368,Nice course that enhance my skills,4
99369,Very great course. I've learned AngularJs and web design skills very well in this course. It is good to anyone who want to built more versatile website.,5
99370,"Wow, what a great course!I work as a Java programmer in a big company, and took this course (as well as Yaakov's other course) while commuting to work.This course gives you the knowledge you need and makes sure you get your hands dirty in the weekly assignments so you can really ""speak"" Angular, and all in a fun and enjoyable way.Thank you Yaakov!",5
99371,Great Course,5
99372,Great Course.,4
99373,the course was very very planned by yaakov covering all aspects related to angular and taught it very well too with well planed exercise assignments.,5
99374,This course helped me learn AngularJS very quickly. The instructor is extremely knowledgeable and presents the material in a very coherent manner and it is very easy to follow and apply. I heartily recommend this course to anyone interested in learning AngularJS.,5
99375,Really great and useful course. Using a lot of information received here in my daily work!,5

99377,Very good course,5
99378,Best course for Single Page Web Applications (with AngularJS) I've seen so far. Teaching skills is everything and this Yaakov Chaikin is really good at it. I've learned a lot from it!,5
99379,"Excellent course. Fun and great instructor. It took me a while to get around how Angular works but it was worthwhile. The assignments were fun and in some cases challenging, be sure to give yourself enough time to complete them, especially in light of the peer-grading.",5
99380,"Very fast pace, but also very good delivery so it helps you get through it. Great course that will not only teach you the simple things of angular but also the in depth design of it as well. Great course and very happy to have passed :)",5
99381,Clean and very understandable,5
99382,highly recommended course for beginners!!!!,5
99383,Excellent course. I am not a GUI developer but the course is setup in such an easy to learn and practice. The course covers concept of language to coding then unit testing. It starts with small code then is built up to larger project. It also covers best practices for large project development. Highly recommended.,5
99384,"Top course from Johns Hopkins University as always...Angular js can sometimes be tricky to understand,but the way they presented it made things very easy to understand.The most thing which i like about the course is that it not only teaches the angular js but also gives an idea of how the things work at backend. Thus making the concepts more clear and doubt free...Last but certainly not the least THANKS JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY FOR PRESENTING SUCH A KNOWLEDGE FULL COURSE ,It certainly made took my web designing skills to a whole new level...",5
99385,Yaakov Chaikin is great - he made it easy for me to learn and finaly use AngularJS - I wish him good cookies for x-mas and everything that is good!,5
99386,Great Teacher!,5
99387,Superb course! please follow it with a course on Angular2,5
99388,The course follows a very structured flow. Regular quizzes reinforce the material and the content provided is easy to understand. The course focuses on a hands on approach and sets you up to develop applications quickly.,5
99389,"its good, on the flow, teacher is good, nicely created, making it understandable",5
99390,Course is awesome. It teach me the proper way of coding,5
99391,Many thanks for great course,5
99392,"Thanks Yaakov for your excellent material and for give me the opportunity to learn a new programming language. Really I appreciate your spent time for this course, it was not really easy for me at begin, I am not exactly a millennial, I come from old school of FoxPro, Clipper, RPG, Cobol and other that is better not mentions :). I feel your passion to explain in details each topic and once again my thank for that and encourage us to continue finish it.",5
99393,Very good Course!,5

99399,It's such a awesome course for beginner. tutor is also teach very flexible way. you can learn more in angular if you register it. Thankx,4
99400,Great course. Covered the whole angular with all the basic concepts with good examples.,5
99401,Very good course,5
99402,The best course I've ever taken. Yakov is so awesome. He makes hard concepts simply easy. His style of teaching is amazing. The content of the course covers A LOT. The assignments help you to actually learn. The professor really knows how to teach.,5
99403,Great course. Challenging concepts but very well explained by Yaakov,5
99404,"Instructor is so passionate about the topic, that it is hard Not to do what he is suggesting. I'll definitely try to sign in to his other courses. One can tell how much effort was put into making this course.Course setup, lecture length, difficulty level, it was all appropriate.Thank you for very enjoyable, and worth a wile 5 weeks!",5
99405,"I was really impressed with this course. The pace of the material was better than I'd hoped and the time commitment advertised was very accurate. The focus on understanding the concepts before getting into the syntax and specifics was excellent. I took this course à la carte, but it is is loosely coupled and I didn't feel like I was entering mid-stream. I will probably go back and take the rest of the classes.",5
99406,Fantastic course. I have taken a few different AngularJS courses. This one is by far the best. Yaakov is extremely thorough. Yaakov builds a strong foundation and he layers on each concept with the same attention to detail. The subject can be complex and Yaakov's encouragement is appreciated. Yaakov's humor is also very much appreciated.,5
99407,Really amazing course! I have learned angular js in so depth that I became deliverable to my project in a very less time. Thanks so much Yaakov Chaikin and team.,5
99408,"Best course (after CS50), that I took in Internet! Thank you VERY MUCH, Yaakov!!!",5
99409,"Great course which leads you step by step, explaining how and why various concepts in AngularJS works. I didn't have any knowledge of Angular before this course, but now I have clear picture how angular applications are structured, what are components of it and how to make use of those.Great course which deserves 5 stars rating !",5
99410,It is a very useful course! I learned a lot about Angular. All the concepts are well explained and you will love AngularJS after just five weeks.,5
99411,Great course. Really enjoyed every bit of it and thumbs up to the instructor and his team. Keep the great work up,5
99412,Great course. Love this course. Taught me a lot.,5

99414,Great course for the persons having a first hand at AngularJS.,5
99415,Very helpful course! Easy to get started and covers a lot of areas of AngularJs.,5
99416,"This course is one of my favorite course in Coursera, Specially its really interesting to learn AngularJS. I had lot of fun while taking this course. If you want to dive in to AngularJS you can learn so many things on this course. And the rest of the thing is amazing professor he made me always happy learner , he loves cookies !!!",5
99417,Awesome course. The instructor is perfectly clear and understandable. The assignments are very well-documented and the code examples are awesomely laid!,5
99418,Really nice cource. The instructor is really funny and teachs in an interesting way.,5
99419,I summarize in two words: Course great!,5
99420,"Excellent course. Very well structured, easy to follow and with relevant assignments. I learned a ton about AngularJS and fell in love with it.Also, the professor is a lot of fun!Keep up the great work.",5
99421,"What I loved about this course, is that it was full of JS best-practices, such as using iife's for everything, using arrays to protect against minimization, and splittng out code into small, discrete files. I learned a lot of Angular, but I think I learned even more plain JavaScript. (I've written javascript for years, but evidently not well) In fact, almost every example of angular code I've looked at outside this course seems to ignore alot of these 'basics', so Thank-You.I would LOVE a recommendation for an Angular 2 course that is taught with a similar quality and attention to detail.",5
99422,Great comprehensive explanation of AngularJS. If you are interested in understanding AngularJS properly then it's the course is for you!,5
99423,"This is really a great course, Thanks Yaakov.I am zero start with AngularJS, but through this course I think that I really get a lot and by passed every assignment that I can also use AngularJS well.So it is a right choice get start from this course , Yaakov always offers high quality courses.Thanks Yaakov again.",5
99424,Perfect Teacher with a lot of examples. You'll enjoy this course!,5
99425,"I fell in luv with Johns Hopkins Unversity since HTML5, js and css",5
99426,Great Course,5
99427,I am very glad that I have taken this course,5
99428,It's very good.,5
99429,"Awesome course! Really helped me understand the Angularjs framework and single page web application, in general.",4
99430,Thanks to this course I can add one more skill to my tool belt.,5
99431,"Yet another amazing course from Yaakov Chaikin. Good description of how it works ""under the hood"", deep explanaition ""what to do"" and more important ""why do this way"".Using Git for evaluation, JS best practice, necessity of unit testing - all these things are ""must have"" for modern developer and make course very usefull.Love Yaakov's courses!Big thanks, Yaakov!",5
99432,This course is one of the best that I found on the internet,5
99433,very informative course! the instructor did a wonderful job for explaining the nutshell of AngularJS.,5
99434,Too detailed to a point of fault,5
99435,I would give 5 stars if the pace was not so fast... week 5 especially have large amount of information to process compressed in short period of time.,4
99436,Great course and teacher!!!,5
99437,"Why? The why!Understanding the reasons behind things, is why this is a 5 stars course.",5
99438,I must give rating of five because it is the most interactive course I have ever taken!,5
99439,"Awesome course, as could expected from Yaakov. Both his classes are superb",5
99440,"This was an absolutely amazing course. The material is great and the instructor is great. I am only disappointed that the release of the Week 5 course material was so significantly delayed that it prevented me from finishing the course. I finished the first 4 weeks very rapidly, with perfect grades. Then we waited so long for Week 5 and even when it was finally released the assignment was not yet available, so my life got busy again and now I won't get my certificate :(",4
99441,"Really precious Angular 1.X courses. Even though I have already finished the whole courses and assignments, I believe I will review them again and again in the future. Of course, see Yaakov eating cookies again :).",5
99442,Great course for advanced level,5
99443,"Clear and focused on the fundamentals and, of course, fun. Thank you Prof. Yaakov.",5
99444,The best AngularJS course I have ever attended. Great job Yakov!,5
99445,it's awesome..,5
99446,Very well designed course,5
99447,Very useful level of details. Thanks a lot!,5
99448,Well thought-out and structured course. Provides meaningful explanations to aid proper understanding of what otherwise can be a quite opaque framework.,5
99449,Great course!!! Lot of information were covered and exercises were interesting and close to real life tasks! Thanks for this course!!!,5
99450,Very well made and delivered.,5
99451,Great,5
99452,It's a very well put together course. The instructor is excellent.,5
99453,Very high quality course. It does not only teach you how to use the tools that Angular provides but also why it works the way it works.,5
99454,Great course for me.Now I use Angular in my current work project.Thanks!,5
99455,I really enjoyed this course. I have learned a lot. The teacher is magnificent!!!!,5
99456,Very good teacher.You will understand the why for each feature,5
99457,Great teaching and coding,5
99458,The Angular learner's best choice .Excellent course I have ever met.Looking forward to more course from Professor Yaakov.Sincerely Thanks.,5
99459,"Excellent course, thanks Yaakov!!",5
99460,"Thank you, Yaakov!You made an EXCELLENT course and so funny to learn.Keep doing your best!",5
99461,"The best thing about this course -- aside from Yaakov's personality -- is that it takes you under the hood of angular so that you understand what is happening at the level of vanilla JavaScript! It doesn't just teach you about Angular, it teaches you to be a better developer.",5
99462,where are the source code???,4
99463,I really enjoyed and learned a lot from this course.,5
99464,"Another amazing course by Yaakov!!! Currently on Week 2 and have already learned a tremendous amount. Start with his HTML, CSS, Javascript course and then take AngularJS. Also, I suggest being patient and understanding your own methods of learning. I find that my retention for the lessons is best when watching the same video two or three times and replicating each project :)",5
99465,Wonderful teacher . Excellent way of communication,5
99466,Awesome! Great course. Thank you so much.,5
99467,"Extremely great course for anyone who wants to learn the foundations of AngularJS. This was one of the most challenging courses I have taken on Coursera but I felt like I got a lot of knowledge out for the time I put into the course. My personal suggestions would be to split Week 2 into two separate weeks (the material there was a huge step up compared to Week 1 and there was a lot of it) and possibly include more examples for Week 3 (especially for directives since I thought that was the most difficult part of the course). Overall, I highly enjoyed taking this course from such a wonderful professor.",5
99468,"I enrolled in this course based on the description, which mentioned that we will build a fully function web app at the end. That literally means, at the end of the course. I was expecting to build the web app from the beginning of instruction all the way to the last video. Instead, the code to the web app is on github. The instructor gives very clear explanations for interpolation, directives, expressions, etc and shows what the code looks like in a javascript file. He also does a great job demonstrating how to write and test dependency injections. This course is geared towards beginners who have never see or touched AngularJs and not for those who already have the basics.",4
99469,The Best,5
99470,Great Angular 1.x Course,5
99471,Thank you for this course. I learned a great deal. I really do appreciate how much time and effort Yaakon Chaikin has put into this course. You have a great teaching style.,5
99472,"Great course,Thank you very much",5
99473,The contents are solid and the professor is really enthusiastic!,5
99474,Excellent Course! Great teacher!,5
99475,"Excellent course. The professor is great, teaching both the theory and giving examples right when necessary.",5
99476,good Course,5
99477,Awesome! last week I missed practice of quizzes but hey within that time frame great work :-D,5
99478,Awesome course and best professors....must recommend for this course. Thanks Coursera and Professors,5
99479,well structured,5
99480,Instructor has great command of angular and a friendly demeanor. Coupled with a wonderful sense of humor and you have a great class! Thank you Yaakov,5
99481,Great course with good learning content,5
99482,Excellent cours. It was so useful and helpful for me to understand a lot of concepts of AngularJS. Many thanks for this cours :)You saved for me a lot of time of auto learning!,5
99483,Very good teacher.. Deep concept explaination.. And not too fast .,5
99484,"My sincere recommendations to everyone. ""Single Page Web Applications with AngularJS"" course is great.",5
99485,"After taking a previous course on Angular and reading and trying things, alot was made clear by this instructors slow approach of explaining how things work besides just what they do. Now I feel capable of developing full and large Angular applications.",5
99486,"Great course! Teacher really knows how to teach, covering the basic concepts in the best way possible.",5
99487,Kalman Hazins (previous JHU Rails courses) and Yaakov Chaikin create the most amazing courses! Really really great!This Angular course is challenging.A Rails app appears as the backend of an example (the course being part of a Rails specialization). It would have been nice to see a little more about Angular asset management in Rails.The instructor and staff are very approachable in the forums. Thanks a lot for all your work!,5
99488,The best course on AngularJS I've ever met.,5
99489,best part is to learn how to angular work in background,5
99490,Wonderful Course with very detailed explanation,5
99491,The best Angular 1.5+ class for sure - bravo Yaakov!,5
99492,"Superb course and out of the world instructor. Yaakov's love for cookies and 'vegetables' keeps me going.I wish the modules were released faster so that can do the course at my own pace. Eg: today is a weekend, hard to balance with hectic day of work.",4
99493,Very useful course. I have learnt a lot. The speaker talks really clearly and not so fast. It's just really good course.,5
99494,Yakov is the perhaps the best instructor I've ever had across Ivy League universities and private post-graduate institutions.,5
99495,"This is the best course for Angular. Yakoov is really great teacher, he knows Angular and knows how to explain it. He tries to make us understand how angular works behind the scenes.",5
99496,Great course!,5
99497,"I'm enjoying the course, and the instruction is very easy to follow. Five stars for a teacher who not only respects his students but also understands the importance of humor in education. Good job, Yaakov.",5
99498,Great course with excellent teacher!,5
99499,"So far the material has been great, clear and to the point.",5
99500,Loving this course. Yaakov is both very entertaining and very good at explaining things. I'm enjoying every lecture and am learning a lot which is going to help me massively at my job.Thank you very much :),5
99501,This course is excellent. I really like the step-by-step approach and I find the explanations behind each notion extremely helpful.,5
99502,One of THE BEST courses I have ever attended.,5
99503,Loving the course. Yaakov rocks,5
99504,"Great Course, thx Yaakov",5
99505,"Well organized and well ordered with coding examples for everything.The assignments are interestingAnother great course from Yaakov, 100% recommended.",5
99506,Another great class by Yaakov Chaikin!,5
99507,The course is really great and I'm learning a lot from it. It's clearing a lot of my doubts and now I feel I'm actually learning AngularJS for real. Thanks Yaakov! You're the best!,5
99508,"Really good lessons, well ordered and with coding examples for everything. The subjects may seem overwhelming at moments, but I believe that's due to the nature of AngularJS and it's steep learning curve. The assignments are interesting and challenging, and the support provided by the TA is great.Yaakov adds a pinch of humor that makes the course easier to traverse. 100% recommended.",5
99509,Great course. Lots of useful details which really helps you understand the principles of AngularJS as well as give you possibility to use this knowledge in practice.,5
99510,Wow this course is magnificent. Hats off to the instructor of the course,5
99511,I have learned a lot with this Course,5
99512,Great explanation and examples,5
99513,Easy to understand and with lots of examples. Thanks!,5
99514,"Great course. The lecturer is excellent. No wasting fo time, but also fun. Recommend it!",5
99515,"Great course!!! Yaakov is a very good teacher, explaining every future of angular in a step by step mode.",5
99516,Yaakov is cool as always!,5
99517,"great course, nicely structured, and helpful practice assignments!",5
99518,Best AngularJS course I have seen.Congratulations,5
99519,"Clear lessons, good structure, nice assignments.",5
99520,The best course I've taken in Coursera. Fantastic!,5
99521,Explanations are under the hood.,4
99522,"This course is designed to introduce the versatile AngularJS framework for single page applications. The fun part is that lessons and coding are easy to follow and you get to practice skills learned right from the source code provided by the amazing instructor. By the way, having done the previous course on HTML, CSS and Javascript, I find it easy to follow along.",5
99523,Perfect!,5
99524,"It gives you a very strong foundation.His explanation, and teaching methods are superb, I would be really happy if he was my teacher at university.Yaakov for president!",5
99525,"Extremely accurate, well designed and explained! Awesome!",5
99526,The AngularJS course is great. I am quite familiar with how Angular works as I have worked with Angular before. But still this course teaches me new things in every lecture. And I love the way the instructor delivers his lectures.,5
99527,"Yaakov is a great teacher. This course doesn't just teach AngularJS, it helps understand how it works under the hood. Just what I wanted!",5
99528,Excellent course! Terrific Teacher! this course and the previous one are awesome. I 'm recommending everyone I know to take both courses.,5
99529,"Now this is a course to spend time learning! It's very well prepared in terms of material, it's useful and fun, and it provides ready to use skills I can immediately apply to my websites.",5
99530,Yaakov speaks a language that is easy to understand even for those who are new to the technologies introduced in his courses.,5
99531,"Excellent content - best course on angular js on the internet, and for free. Amazing attention to detail.",5
99532,Really Awesome.,5
99533,Really a good one for beginners,5
99534,Great course,5
99535,The structure of the course is awesome. The teaching approaches are encouraging. Keep up the great work.,5
99536,Keep going like this! :) thank you for all your work !,5
99537,Excellent Course. the topics are well organized and the lectures are very clear.,5
99538,"This is the kind of Angular course i was looking for,every other course i enrolled in,i found that they aren't really explaining what is going on under the hood, this course is certainly doing that which helped me understand important concepts to deepen my understanding. Thank you so much for this gem.",5
99539,"I really like this course, I can finally understand all the WHYs in AngularJS.",5
99540,"Really well explained and easy to follow course. Also it's free, which is something hard to find on coursera these days. Thanks for taking the time to spread knowledge.",5
99541,Great course!,5
99542,This is a fantastic course and it is largely through the tireless effort and enthusiasm of the instructors and support team. I highly recommend it as well as the other courses provided by this instructor.,5
99543,Great job!,5
99544,great course,5
99545,Great course. You will not only learn how to use AngularJS but also how it works behind the scene. This just makes you understand the framework more thoroughly. I am surely gonna try other courses from this author.,5
99546,The best Angularjs course I have ever take. Very well explanation and yaakov is great intructor.,5
99547,"My special ""thank you"" for going deep inside the subject with your ""how?"" and ""why?"", instead of just instructing us ""do this and that"". It's a real pleasure to participate in your class, thank you!",5
99548,Really nice and VERY intense course!,5
99549,This is an excellent course. The lectures are clear and very well-prepared. The course material is excellent and Yaakov is an excellent presenter: very informative and engaging. Highly recommended.,5
99550,"best instructor, i wish i could have more courses by him, he explains everything very well, in details and clear. i really enjoyed this course.",5
99551,"Like the course so much! Deserves 10 stars not only 5Yaakov, you got a special talent in teaching stuff and making complex things simple! it is really a pleasure to be in your class. One last thing.. take it easy with cookies ;-)",5
99552,Course is well designed and well taught. worth waiting all these days and a must course to take!,5
99553,Instructor is fantastic. Examples are simple but not trivial and is perfect for understanding some complex constructs. Speed of instruction is just right. Highly recommend.,5
99554,Must Recommended!,5
99555,One of the best online course I have taken till now.Thanks for making AngularJS learning so much fun!!,5
99556,Best AngularJS course ever. Great explanation of concepts and functionality.,5
99557,"Great course with a lot of details and clear instructions which gives answer to lot of my questions. Thanks Yaakov, keep up the great work.",5
99558,"The videos are clear, easy to follow and with plenty of examples, great information and content. Lots of material and sources to read, actually in my case not enough time to read it. The teacher YaaKov is a great instructor, his assignments are written in great detail and very clear steps, so is easy to comprehend and execute. The teacher as well as the teaching staff always answer promptly and in depth your questions or comments in the forum. This is my second course with Yaakov Chaikin and I am very happy with this particular course and the great instructor and the extra resources he offers to learn .",5
99559,"Great course. I really like the explanations, it really makes sense.",5
99560,Learnt very good tricks about placement of objects. Missed some design patterns or game specific algorithms.,4
99561,"Amazing, complex, interesting, professional.",5
99562,"As a woman, I learned a surprising amount of stuff I never knew before",4
99563,Useful and practical course,4
99564,I enjoyed the course quite a bit. What would really be useful is more opportunity to work examples or problem sets. The quizzes and knowledge checks don't really give me a sense that I really know the material,4
99565,Great help on Excel!,5
99566,"This course teaches how to use spreadsheet to do some predictive modelings. Although no depth in math, but for me, some practical skills and functions are introduced.I just give 4 stars only because the overall content is still kinda simple. I though I could have learnt more with this price.",4
99567,This course is a little bit hard than the fundamental.,5
99568,Wish there were more take home examples,5
99569,"While I really enjoyed the first module, I was less impressed by this one. Have the course is very basic, while the rest is just too brief and not practical enough. I will however continue with the courses and expect the next module to build on the one reviewed here.",3
99570,Definitely could be more systematic and clear. Sample spreadsheets could be improved in many ways and any attention to detail would do this course much good. Tests and quizzes also could benefit a lot with a revise-currently plenty of confusion with phrases and wording.,2
99571,the quiz shall have more hands on task and the depth of the contents is not enough. thanks!,4
99572,Very little new and does not include more complex sensitivity analysis for corporate valuation,2
99573,"I think its oa good course, however, the XLS examples could be better and more complete (?) did not find some functions. German English Exec translation is a bit anoying - bit worried how that will work in more complex courses...",4
99574,I was expecting an intro course for beginners... this was not it. I'd say this is more of a refresher course for intermediate/advanced users who are out of practice.,2
99575,Just wish to have some concept check before taking the quiz.,3
99576,Very informative.,5
99577,The course was well blended and covered depth about models which can be seen in a business work place. However there should have been practice exercises before the quizzes to understand the topics better.,4
99578,"Challenging material to do via the web, but explained in a paced, systematic way.",5
99579,There were some useful examples in this course. But overall this course and the entire specialisation rely too heavily on Excel which seems a bit outdated when data sets are so much bigger these days (than the ones in this course). Based on the requirements of companies hiring data and business analysts the expectation for anybody who wants to work in this field is in at least one or more programming languages.,3
99580,"Overall it is a good course, however, despite assuming minimal knowledge of Excel Statistical Modules, it offers little insight and practice. I would prefer a more in depth approach (for the advanced), or more exercises for those getting familiar with spreadsheets.",3
99581,"This course could work better as either a longer course with more examples, exercises, and step by step instructions in excel, or as a smaller part of the first and third courses in the specialization. The content is good and the examples are properly explained, but it probably doesn't warrant an entire course of its own",3
99582,Excellent course - easy to understand even without quant background!,5
99583,It was not challenging. Could raise the difficulty a little.,3
99584,"A particularly useful course. It built on my existing Excel knowledge and ""expertise"". I really enjoyed it, as all the skills learned in this course can be applied in the real world.",5
99585,"Quick, easy, learned some nice tips even-though I am a heavy excel user.",4
99586,"The slides are not at all helpful. Unfortunately, this is a far less useful course than the companions in the specialization. The quizzes tend to be glitchy, and have a maddening propensity to have users type formulas,",2
99587,Thank you. It's well structured.,5
99588,"good, but need excersices which students can apply all the concept",4
99589,I really liked the Excel tools Professor Don used. The material covered was very useful as well.,5
99590,I don't feel learning much after the class. Particularly I think the video should be better made to present the spreadsheet content more clearly and i think there should be more emphasis on important points during the lecture session.,2
99591,It is quite basic and sometimes the quiz can be a little confusing.,3
99592,A steep learning curve makes learning easier.,5
99593,Great course!,5
99594,A bit boring – way too basic. And I expected it to be a bit more systematic – simple (and quite fragmented) examples around one case... Could be a bit more.,3
99595,"This course was a extremely introductory course in excel. I would not recommend it to anyone, especially at the cost of $95. Aside from getting yourself thinking about using Excel and some minor lessons learned, I found it to be a complete waste of time.",1
99596,"Most suitable for people who have had very limited exposure to spreadsheets. Anyone that has spent considerable time working in Excel will find this pretty limited. The final portion of this course (Monte Carlo simulations) was the most interesting part, as it got into the more statistical functions and the Solver applications.",3
99597,"It's kind of difficult, but really useful",5
99598,"The course was useful, but the quizzes were frustrating. Whenever there is a write in answer for a quiz question, I know I will get it wrong. Even though I am certain my answer is right, it never gets recognized as being correct.",3
99599,Great professor - learning a lot despite 15 years working in Excel,5
99600,"Great course. Could you a video on Excel on Mac, and differences between Sheets and Excel a little earlier on though! ;)",5
99601,The course covers all the necessary theoretical basica of statistics and modeling but isn't very helpful in terms of practical implementation.,3
99602,"Weak, definitely not what I would call a ""course"". Should have been at least twice as long to give more depth. Also, too many type-in answers for quizzes.",2
99603,"very good course: simple, clear and useful",5
99604,"The content and pacing is great after week1. Wk1 was a bit elementary, introduction and all. Overall, learned some new Excel tricks so it was worth it.",4
99605,This coarse don't worth 80 bucks at all,2
99606,"Some of the ideas discussed are useful & new to me like linear programming and what-if analysis. The content is more suited to this specialization context instead of teaching excel in general so in case you are looking to learn excel, this is not a great course. I didn't like the quizzes, most of the questions added no value. My suggestion to the instructors would be less questions on the quizzes and more relevant to what you teach. I wouldn't complete the course if it wasn't a part of the specialization that I am attending.",2
99607,great learning experience,5
99608,Good introductory preview,5
99609,"Completing this course helped me improve both my theoretical knowledge and practical skills in MS Excel, discover exciting new tools and technics for modeling. Thanks a lot!",4
99610,Not worth the time and energy.,2
99611,Too basic and superficial.,2
99612,Challenging but very informative could use more in depth examples but appreciated the history lesson on spreadsheets,5
99613,"Decent introduction course however examples are very simple as well as the models that are constructed. I understand being an intro course the content needs to ease people into the subjects however, more realistic and real-life examples are necessary to take the material from this course and apply it.",3
99614,"It was fairly easy and short. In comparison to the Duke course, it was way too shallow.",2
99615,very challenging :) learned a lot.,5
99616,The course does not make you learn spreadsheets in detail.,3
99617,needs more clarity,2
99618,This course is somewhat lacking depth. The introduced tools are very basic and I would have expected more content for the prize,2
99619,"Really basic spreadsheet knowledge, not to be recommanded for anybody who is already familiar with Excel.",1
99620,strong excel practice training,5
99621,"very clear examples, relatively slow pace, which allows you to understand and exercise a lot",5
99622,good course,5
99623,The course is fine but very short videos and lack deeply explanations.,3
99624,It was not very informative,4
99625,Great experience.It's not so time consuming. Love it !,5
99626,Introduction to Spreadsheets and Models provides very useful tools in learning how to think with numbers. I highly recommend this course.,5
99627,Challenging yet a great learning experience,5
99628,Very good and challenging!,5
99629,Great if you are looking for the basics.,4
99630,too superficial in the discussed ideas,3
99631,Too easy for financial spreadsheets,2
99632,Tough but fair.,5
99633,"Sometimes, when I worked the spreadsheets out, the data differed from that on the examples. The items in the course were good and built up well. Some more details would have been nice. The instructor went over some spreadsheet steps quite fast.",4
99634,A very important part of the 5 series course. Broadly covers all the important spreadsheet functions and models.,5
99635,"Amazing! Packed with so much useful info, that I keep returning to months after completing the course!",5
99636,I've only taken 2 classes with Wharton online. This and Intro to financial accounting. Financial accounting is awesome. It taught smoothly and explained things well. This class jumped around and didn't give full explanations and had questions on one quiz that we didn't learn until the next week.,2
99637,This course is super useful and provides clear explanation. Strongly suggest,5
99638,"I didn't know how to make cashflow assumptions. Also, instructor jumps from one lesson to another without enough explanation how did he reach to the solution",2
99639,"This course does not belong to this specialization. Poor content, poor assessment quiz, and felt quite disappointed. It is way below par. I never thought I would have to rate it this bad. If not for specialization that I am aiming for, I would never take it. Period.",1
99640,the quiz is so frustrating,2
99641,Excellent learning opportunity for distant learners,5
99642,"Good course. Not excellent, but useful nonetheless!",4
99643,"Some of the explanations are not clear, and the knowledge net is not clear as previous chapter. But it is still good for me overall!",4
99644,"Pros: Very good information and methods for running real life business models. The course provided the spreadsheet modules which allowed you to tinker around and learn them. I consider myself a power Excel user and I picked up some very good new modeling methods. Very concise.Cons: I did Week 2 on my lunch break. Some questions on the quizzes were a bit vague. Probably need some working knowledge of Excel before taking this class.If you need to complete a lot of modeling with your job, this is a good course to pick up some skills.",4
99645,Few tools on Xls has been shown.More extensive and complex problem are required on use of Monte Carlo method,3
99646,"It's a good course, with quite a bit for a newbie to learn. Would have appreciated more in-depth examples in the lectures though, as I often found a gap in the lectures and the questions asked in the quiz. Even otherwise, good stuff.",3
99647,"The lecture was quite good but some questions of the quiz made me confused, maybe it can be written in a different expression.",5
99648,"The slide set is too brief, was expecting more details with examples & visuals",3
99649,Good introduction,3
99650,"The tests were not upto the mark, where the questions were not very logical and the options were confusing.",1
99651,Great!,4
99652,"I had great expectations, but the course focuses on really basic stuff. If you have worked with spreadsheets before, it won't help much. If you haven't, it will not teach you how to use it.",1
99653,Would give this course 5 stars to be honest. It's just that the lecture slides are not informative enough (only course outlines are there) & look like they weren't made seriously.,4
99654,This course is poorly organized and presented in comparison to other MOOCs offered by Wharton.,2
99655,Exercises should be better designed and I think that first week of this course and the whole previous one are too basic. They could be assumed for 99% of people and I think it would be a good idea to create an optional preparation module containing them. That would save time and perhaps open opportunities for more advanced material to be included.,3
99656,"Concise, no fluff spreadsheet modeling fundamentals with quality instruction concerning the different functions, data analysis and solver add-ins needed to start building effective financial models. Thanks Professor Huesman.",5
99657,"I like the course but currently it has some issues. First and foremost problem is tests. There are some questions that allow ambiguous interpretation, some questions require to know the information that is discussed later in course and so on. Also the lectures are quite short. Other than that course gives very nice introduction into using the spreadsheets in modelling",4
99658,"This course is very brief and basic introduction to spreadsheets. It was surprising that the ""pivot tables"" was never mentioned in this course.",3
99659,It seems too easy,4
99660,Is not as bad as I thought at the beginning (the first two weeks). It gets better the third week. I think it needs some improvement though.,3
99661,Wharton's online MD can not have a course so poorly develop (lectures vs quiz vs material),3
99662,"Frankly speaking, it should be the most disappointing MOOC I have ever enrolled so far. The Professor's teaching is clear and comprehensible but the depth of the course content cannot meet the university level, especially from a worldwide renowned school like Wharton. Quiz is the most terrible part which seems like nobody could get it because of the ambiguous questions and paranoid answer area. Personally, I, like many other mates, am really grateful to Coursera for offering everyone this equal opportunity. But courses with that kind of quality but staggering price will destroy the company's brand. We all want Coursera to go further and better, but few people prefer monopoly businessman rather than prestigious professors and diligent intellectuals.",1
99663,"For what you pay for, this course is not worth it. While I was able to follow the lectures, the material is very introductory and I was hoping to learn more. The lectures are really short in duration and the quizzes aren't challenging. I feel that pricing of this Specialization is purely due to the brand name of Wharton. Please improve this Specialization to encompass more depth in the course material or lower the price.",2
99664,It was a good course. The quizzes should be corrected since some questions are ambiguous.,3
99665,"The lecturer was very slow, and some things were not explained very well (while very simple concepts were often over-explained).Also, I'm quite sure there were at least 2 errors in the weekly quizzes. One that comes to mind is a question that had identical options for two of the multiple-choice answers, but only one of them was correct (50/50 guess, more or less --- I had to take the quiz 3 times before I guessed right!).",3
99666,"This course helped me understand the functionality of Excel and Google Sheets better. I was very intrigued by the fact how this software provides functionality into building business decision-making models, without necessarily having to resort to much more complex statistical packages such as Stata.",5
99667,"Great introductory course for the subject. There were some parts, especially at the start of this course, in which the subject matters were being explained too simplistically and very quickly - not a good combination to maximize ones efforts.",4
99668,"Many errors in the quizzes made this course a disaster, although the course staff was eager to correct them as more complains in the discussions arrived. Being the second course in the specialisation, it doesn't actually live up to the expectations as it mostly covers the very basics of the excel functionality in terms of modelling.",3
99669,A bit too basic at the beginning.,3
99670,"Overall the course was good, but the quiz assignments need work. When entering formula's there should be more clarity. Formula's can be entered in many ways and even when right were often counted as wrong.",3
99671,"Very basic, but that's the point. A good review of the capabilities of spreadsheets for simulating scenarios with a probabilistic mindset.",5
99672,Several problems with the student assessment.,4
99673,"The qiuz are managed terribly, full of error and I seriously doubt the professor ever seen these quiz before. The Course suit for a beginner but a bit fragile, I expect more about building a usable model. This course need serious review.",1
99674,Nothing new and no challenging exercises. It could be more interactive,1
99675,1st 3 weeks were helpful but questions of the quiz were unclear & improvement is really necessary but still an ok course for basic learners.It could be much better,2
99676,"What to say about this course? On the one hand, I learned a lot which merits the three stars. On the other hand, the quizzes were very poorly designed. It took me the maximum three tries on every single quiz to pass and I did just barely. Hey, this is EXCEL, not advanced calculus! Also, there were questions on the quiz that weren't even covered in the particular module. E.g., on quiz #1, there was a question about ""objective functions"" which the instructor didn't explain until the last course module. There were times when I questioned my own sanity until I read in the course discussions that others were experiencing the same issues. Before presenting this course again, TEST, TEST, TEST the quizzes and answers!! And if you're not going to allow for a range of correct answers or formatting variances, then change all questions to multiple choice where there's (maybe) a fighting chance of passing. I am immensely relieved this course is done and I can move on to the next one in the specialization--hoping it's better organized as was the Fundamentals course that Richard Waterman taught. I was fearful that a course in Excel was going to doom me for the rest of the specialization. Last recommendation: improve the presentation materials. Provide more details for reference purposes. Okay, I'm going to go relax, now, to recover from this trying experience....",3
99677,"This course was very average to me. Compared to the first course in the specialization, Fundamentals of Quantitative Modeling, which was absolutely great.What I liked:Good info on the tools in excel that are needed.What I didn't like:Time spent on content that necessarily wasn't regarding models; the critical material was buried in videos and was very brief. More time should have been spent. Additionally the quiz questions were subjective at times based on what was said on video and the formula answers weren't correctly graded in many cases.This course could have been much better, maybe I was just spoiled by the first course.",3
99678,"This course needs a total overhaul; in its current state it is a detriment to both Coursera and the Wharton Online brand. First, there was relatively little content; there was less than an hour of lectures each week and no actual programming involved. Second, the material was pitched at a very basic level, but not in a good way. Third, the tests didn't manage to even test the material being covered. For example, when given a mean and stdev, when asked to find a value, often the lecture would use an approximation ( i.e., a 2-tailed 95% distributed = 2.00 std devs. ) This is a class on excel: there is NO excuse for not introducing norm.s.inv and norm.s.dist when asking that question. When the test required the ""approximation"" rather than the exact calculation? Everything about this course was wrong, it needs to be scrapped and thrown away.",1
99679,nice and short!,5
99680,The professor introducted the features very,4
99681,It seems to me like the course could have like 2 or 3 times more video concerning tasks required,3
99682,Good course overall,3
99683,"This course needs tremendous improvement. In contrast to previous fundamentals of quantitative modelling module, this lags in lot of areas. No clear explanations and the quizzes are worded super vague and filled with with bugs. I expected a lot under Monte Carlo Simulation. However, too simplistic example and explanation was presented. The topics were not introduced clearly.",3
99684,"Very poor course. Low depth of teaching, assignments awfully developed.",1
99685,"need to pay for testthis course is excellent! the professor is very professional, I understood everthing. he Explain everthing in plain english.",4
99686,"The course is too shallow. I wish all topics were covered more in details. Moreover, it is unreasonably expensive for only about 3 total hours of lectures.",4
99687,"The professor of this course expects you to read his mind too much, preferring to skip through explaining his reasoning for solving some problems, such as calculating risk with the Empirical rule. He also mentions subject in the course outlines which he is supposed to lecture about in the course but doesn't, or just expects you to learn it yourself.",3
99688,"A separate class for spreadsheets and modeling isn't bad perse. The best way to teach these models is to integrate them during finance or accounting, or whatever specific class you are trying to learn.That said this is probably a good resource for someone with 0 and I mean absolutely NO experience with excel. However my gut feeling also tells me that those who have had 0 experience with excel will not be able to follow the models shown in this class.",3
99689,"The exam answers were not clear.... The were questions not related to the videos. This was an excel course and no excels were available to download, just PDF. In the other two courses (Quantitative Modeling and Accounting Analytics) the excels were explained and available for download. This was an excel course and no excels available.....",3
99690,"This was very disappointing, especially considering it's a Wharton product. The ""course"" was little more than an afternoon's worth of seminars. Since I am not a paying participant, I could not take the quizzes, so I finished watching the videos in less than a day.In addition, there are NO collateral or supporting materials provided. None of the spreadsheets or workbooks illustrated in the videos are available anywhere on the course site, despite their being advertised in the videos. All in all, it was consistent with the first course in this ""specialization"".Again, very disappointing. I'm glad I didn't spend any money on this.",1
99691,This is a great course for beginners! Each step is explained thoroughly with great demonstration which makes it easier for me to keep up and understand.,5
99692,Excellent course and teachers,5
99693,Good course material and structure. Discussion Forums seem deserted at this stage.,4
99694,"Great course with a very good mix of theory, practice and real-world practitioners.I believe this course will be especially helpful for teams transitioning to agile and for ""classical"" project managers. The age of ""command and control"" has passed and Agile is a great iteration on top of this management style. Great teacher, great content and great course!",5
99695,A must for all project managers,5
99696,"Great, exactly after this course I got a project with Agile SDLC, so it was exactly in the right time!",5
99697,"Some of the SCRUM, XP & Agile Practices can be better explained. I have expected a few more things here.",3
99698,"Great content, but I felt some sections of the assignments were vague, making them more confusing/harder than needed.",4

99703,great practical insights,5
99704,"Highly interesting, I do recommend the courseThank you Alex",4
99705,"Videos are helpful and well done. Though I don't like the questions in the middle of a video, they interrupted the flow too much.",5
99706,really helps to understand how to managing Agile team,5
99707,Excellent ideas and practice for managing an Agile Team. Highly recommended.,5
99708,"Awesome course, excellent balance between theoretical & methodos + testimonial from professionals. Maybe a little bit more real-life example of successful products developed with the agile method would have been great",5
99709,This is an amazing course. It's the exact course I needed to get my agile learning started. Thanks for this.,5
99710,In depth and practical.Some more linking to the previous courses could provide better framing of the courses content in the larger scheme. For a more systemic view of how all things are connected in this course and all previous courses I would have to go deep into it all again. As this was my first acquaintance with such a course,4
99711,Best course from the specialization.,5
99712,"I gave the first course a very bad review and the second course an ok review. Now I am very impressed about how they are constantly working to improve all aspects of the course.For example: Now you can download the assignments on word (before you had to copy item by item from a pdf) and the test are not so ambiguous as they used to be. I remember, in the past, to continuously have the feeling that questions in test were too open to interpretation and that the right answer will be defined by some random detail, now they are definitely more straight forward.I also happened to have to log-in in the Online University where I got my Master's Degree years ago and saw their interface is still the same 0 user friendly and a very bad feeling of impossible communication so it really helped me appreciate the effort in improving the course. I really appreciate how they are willing to apply agile methodology to the course and with each iteration they make it better!",5
99713,Very good course specialization. You can learn a lot if following closely. They gonna have to modify the course using Angular 2 in order to be relevant to the newest/modern framework.,4
99714,"It's very time consuming, but it's worth it!It's when you put all the concepts learned in the previous courses, and with this, the bugs also come altogether.A tip: Scale down your idea, because the time may not be enough!",5
99715,"Dear Instructors;Thank you for the excellent course and the great sessions you provided. Keeping a combination of technology, professionalism and humor in your sessions was always a great experience and brought smile to my face when following your instructions. I believe keeping this spirit in your courses will be of great help and fun for all students.Wish you well in your future teachings and online courses and hope to follow more of them in the future.Kind regards;M.Karami",5
99716,Great overall experience. I found it quite flattering that someone who's final submission I had to grade sent in the exact same paper I sent in and provided the same links I provided to an API on areascore.ca (which is a domain I own) as well as links to repositories in my bitbucket account (which I now have made private). The only thing that would upset me is this person getting a better grade than I did.,5
99717,"I feel grateful that I found this course. This course is my first step as a learner in Coursera and it helps me to learn the fundamental skill that I need for my thesis, which is about CRM mobile application. It structure of this specialization is great, even though I got struggled in the capstone course because of lack explanation about IBM Bluemix.",4
99718,Great cours !!,5
99719,Excellent course. I would recommend to everyone willing to boost your career to a new level.,5
99720,That was a great experience!,5
99721,"The course is well structured and Prof Muppala presents it in an interesting way. The range of technology covered was good and would be useful. The CapStone Project timelines are not realistic at all - one has to start implementing almost from the word go, the artificial interim reports are distracting if one does not realize that and I think many students are forced to a second session to complete the course.",3
99722,Very useful to learn the mean stack techniques.,5
99723,wonderful experience!,5

99757,The course is simple follow. The instructor shares little things that make big differences if you practice in your real life.,5

99767,Practical and helpful guidance.,4
99768,"It was a short and good course. It has videos of good quality, short examples and talks. Every week it has lecture slides, articles about the week. But It was really short and contain too little information and subject. I hope that you will add more information. It was helpful to me and I hope that It help more to another students.",3

I would not pay for the certificate unless you need one per se.I found that modules 1 and the communications part of module 3 were useful. However, the most valuable thing I got from the course was the link to the lecture by Mike Sanders on Advanced Multi-tasking.The reference material referred to is very light - there are no reading lists and one link is to an out-of-date web page. Coursera may wish to review whether it continues offering this course.",2
99787,This course is very useful for me. I am now applying this into my daily working tasks. Many thanks Margaret and team!,5
99788,There are some good tips and I do recommend to take this course for FREE. I think its too overpriced for what you end up getting from the course.,4

When I read this ""4-8 hours of videos, readings, and quizzes"" I thought that there will be 4-8 hours of videos _besides_ readings and quizzes. So this one is a bit misleading.Despite of this I liked the course. It gave me a lot of tricks and tips. However I don't understand the final 96.4% either. Maybe I missed something because after the last assignment the result has gone away in less then 1 second. As far as I know all my assignments were 100%.The design of the videos is a bit ""spartan"" :) I finished a couple of other Coursera courses (HCI, Gamification etc.) where the videos were much more delightful.

This may be an issue of english not being my mother language, but comparing to other courses that's is a possible explanation.Thank you very much.",4

100330,it was direct to the point with very practical suggestions,5
100331,"Short but very direct. Small changes, as the Professor says, are key to change habits. And the course lives up to this. Though there are many more things to be done, the elements given are a good start to get us in the right path",5
100332,Short but really good tips,5
100333,"done with in few hours; found it's useful for interview preparing, particularly for the multitasking part. have habits of time management, though didn't know how to organise language to show that quality during an interview.",4

100340,"This course offers very useful tools and topics that would lead you to improve your time management and at the same time introduce you to a more productive work environment.It is a bit short and I think that it could go deeper on its content, offering other tools in time tracking and visualization.I definitely recommend this course.",4

100347,Really informative. Every concept was presented in a simple and clear way. Easy to understand and all the materials and knowledge offered will certainly be crucial for my professional career. Thank you for everything!,5
100348,"Some things are useful, such as the table ""task list"", but I would say there isn't enough of this type of help. It would be better if there were more tables like that.Also, more information and help is needed on how to accomplish multitasking. Unfortunately, multitasking is necessary in many environments, from office to home, and even a housewife has to multitask. One of the most important aspects of multitasking that was not covered and that is really needed is how to multitask in a situation of ""housewife"" type of work. Examples of this include engineering, molecular biology, chemistry, work in a lab in general etc. You constantly need, like a housewife, put something for a chemical reaction (or start laundry, or put a cake in the oven), and then you have to wait for the chemical reaction to occur. And during that time when you wait, you need to keep this ongoing ""laundry"" task in your head, so that you don't forget to take it out later on time. And when there are more than 3-4 tasks like that, and they all have this ""pick me up and start on me later"" thing, they are all in your head and they take up all your memory and resources. And the worst part is, it's difficult to schedule them, because you need to schedule not how long will something take, not in a linear fashion, but how long will multiple parallel things take. I would really appreciate it if there was something about this topic in a time management course.",2
100349,Very informative course.,5
100350,Very useful,4
100351,"Although quite short, I found this course had so interesting and effective ideas",4

100353,This course is really good for initiating productivity. Thanks to all involved with the development of such a good course.,5
100354,"This course definitely teaches you to work smarter, it is the simple changes that make this all possible. This course however can be done in one sitting, not sure if it can be called a course and I am not sure that I want to pay to get certified for taking it. One little pet peeve I experienced was when the Professor kept saying ""refer back"" that is grammatically incorrect. You simply refer to something.",4
100355,Great course.,5
100356,Very useful course， only problem is too short！,4
100357,"Good practical and useful tips. In my opinion, the topics are covered with the right detail within the right time.Thank you!",5
100358,Some practical time management tips. I found the parts on how to sort email and how to buffer crisis time especially useful.,4
100359,There is not much information you would not know before taking the course. I was expecting more tips and tricks how to change well known theory to practical life.,2
100360,Great opinions and resources,5
100361,"relative quick and easy, but with valuable lessons.",4
100362,"I soon got bored with the simplistic solutions, lack of challenge, and frankly, a condescending attitude. I then took all the quizzes, guessed or surmised the answers, got 100% right, and went on to something more productive.",1
100363,"I Love this Course, and the instructor is a very wonderful communicator.",5
100364,Excellent course! It really helped me to organize my time not only at work but at home for my chores and side projects!,5
100365,Very interesting. Often the most obvious and easiest tricks are the most efficient. Thanks a lot!,4
100366,I think that's a very good programme and a professional instructor .,3
100367,Very basic and trivial information that can be easily summarized in an article. Not need for a whole course.,1
100368,Very practical and pragmatic. Most helpful. Beneficial to all.,4
100369,"It's alright, but could be much much better. I didn't feel engaged and half of the time I was just wishing the video would just end. The course itself highlighted some good ideas about saving time and prioritising, but the way it was presented just fell short for me.",3
100370,"The course is short but contains a lot of things. It helps me to track my time and review what has been done in a day, week, month and year. By studying these statistics I could re-arrange my time of doing things, prioritizing myself and discipline myself. Thanks a lot for this course.",5
100371,Thanks to the authors for the course. It contains some useful information however it would be great to add more practical tools and techniques which can increase one's productivity.,4
100372,This course is very useful and meaningful which helped in saving my time and improved my efficiency,5
100373,It covers very basic concepts of time management.,3

100379,Very objectively and smartly presented and conducted.,5
100380,"Professional, spot on and enjoyable. Thank you for doing this!",5
100381,Short but essential,4
100382,"It is definitely beneficial to a certain extent but I thought that it was a little dry. However I really enjoyed the time period of each video, as I am the kind of people that tends to get a restless when the teaching gets too long",3
100383,great introduction to time management,4
100384,Very poor course. Not at all academically rigorous. Just a bunch of common sense statements. Instructor's presentation style borders on condescending.,1
100385,Very basic yet eye opening course.,4
100386,Good course. It's very practical and the things thought help.,5
100387,Good brief overview of class at the 100 college level. Would be good for someone about to go back to school for undergrad.,4
100388,I enjoyed the course and plan to incorporate the things I learned with my daily tasks at work to improve productivity.,4
100389,excellent course and will make you look to your time differently.,4
100390,thanks,5
100391,It was a great course.Dr.Simon and Dr.Yenn did a great work in summarising and preparing great etivities.Dr.Sandra Halperin's research methods and views will stay for a long time with me.,5
100392,The course is very good.,5
100393,Really loved this course. It was completely understandable and easy to apply to my own project. I only wish there was more to the review function!,5
100394,The course is not well constricted to guide students.. it's only fill the gaps.,2
100395,"The course is very basic, it should have more in depth topics or maybe it should be within a specialization of a complete research methodology, but thanks, this is a great help.",3
100396,I found this course very useful for my PhD program,5
100397,Good Course!!,4
100398,Its a wonderful course for all research students and beginners to have a good understanding of research methods and Review of Literature in general. I would endorse this course for all research scholars.,5
100399,"Excellent, really helpful! A must for every starting out PhD student!",5
100400,ME PARECE UN MUY BUEN CURSO PERO ME PARECE QUE DE IGUAL FORMA SE DEBERÍAN ENFOCAR A COMO SE DEBEN CITAR LOS AUTORES QUE SE CONSULTAN PARA DISMINUIR EL PLAGIO,4
100401,amazing course for anyone want to know about research,5
100402,its a great experience.,4
100403,"This course is a good first step towards research in any field. Research is something important and delicate and this is a great way to start understanding its purpose, tools and activities.",4
100404,"Well planned!! course, gives you insight into research planning and time management. Professionals suggestions and tips are worth. Great experience and learning.",5
100405,It's a very good course to understand the research methodology,5
100406,The course format and reading materials are of very much helped me to have the concept of research design and research formulation. I recommend this course to my fellow learners..,4
100407,I got to learn a lot about various research methods which i did not know previously. The timing of presentation of various ideas was excellent. Reviewing classmates was a good learning experience.,5
100408,thank you five stars,5
100409,Great course. I am so happy,5
100410,a very good course,4
100411,"Thank you for the knowledge I have gathered here, coursera.org. Understanding Research Methods brings me a lot of idea for my incoming capstone type, CE Project Design as a partial requirement of mine to finish the program I am taking which is Civil Engineering program.",5
100412,"This course should take by the researcher especially those who has problem in their research, they will give you helpful advice and know the opinion of some expert",5
100413,I like the part where exemplars share their views based on their knowledge and experience.,5
100414,The course delivered a very important important aspect of research -ORIENTATION TO SEEK KNOWLEDGE THE SCIENTIFIC WAY !!! THANK YOU COURSE ERA AND THE UNIVERSITY TEAM .,5
100415,Really liked the supplementary materials provided in the course. Also liked hearing about research from various researchers.,4
100416,the course was very interesting and i have benefited more about understanding research methods it will help me do a good research by applying what i have learnt. thank you so much.,5
100417,Great course and amazing videos and lectures.,5
100418,"Great, interesting!!!",5
100419,great! id like to share this to my friends,5
100420,"Dear Coursera team, Thanks for providing the course. It gives best over view about Research Methodology. It tells us how to ask/design a research questions, how to plan, literature review and what are different types of research methods.",5
100421,"It's look very very basics, i thought to get something more informative..",3
100422,Great,5
100423,Nice course but lot of troubles are arising during the completion of this course. still i am unable to complete it and could not find out the reason. Once i got a message that my course is completed and i can get my certificate but now it says still assignment pending... i dont know how to deal with it.,3
100424,"It is a very good introductory course on research methods. It has deepened my understanding of research methods. It has helped me to understand the role of literature review and research design. I also like its unique way of doing this course. Instead of lengthy lecturing, the course presents a few videos interviewing different researchers, having them talk about a certain topic. I've heard different views on the same topic, each of which makes a point. It has definitely helped me to look at the same issue from different perspectives.",5
100425,My experience... I was awesome to know what Research is all about and what basic elements of Research are.,5
100426,It has been a pretty useful course to me as I needed to start from scratch in understanding the research methods.,5
100427,"In learning the precepts of carrying out research and its methods, this course stands me in better stead as a researcher.",5
100428,"Its a concise and meaningful course, will provide better shape to thoughts of a potential reseracher to understand framework of designing one's own reserach. It will definitely gives broader insights on step by step planning and management skills too.",5
100429,"Understanding Research Methods MOOC by University of London helped me out to get extensive knowledge on the basic fundamentals that a researcher should have and should look into. I thank the Course Instructors Dr.J.Simon Rofe and Dr.Yenn Lee, SOAS,University of London for preparing this informative MOOC.",4
100430,"Excellent introduction for a first time researcher. Very helpful and well structured. Thank you, I am inspired to continue studying as I feel more confident.",5
100431,Awesome experience,5
100432,This course relies heavily on self-reading and theoretical knowledge. Video interviews which are part of the curriculum are mostly not useful. Overall the course did not provide me with the value I was looking for.,2
100433,good course for beginners in research,5
100434,"The organization of this course was very good. I liked the themes and their order. I thought the videos could have been longer and more substancial, but the reading were great. I got confused on one of the assignments in which the questions of the given chapter were supposed to be answer. There were 3. I must have misunderstood or have another file, because no one I read had such question and I got not so great reviews. I think this should be looked at. Either way, thank you for this opportunity!",3
100435,It is Great. Thank you!,4
100436,THANK YOU FOR THE GUIDANCE.,4
100437,Very Important and Essential Course for Researchers,5
100438,"The course gave a very good introduction to what research is about, how to plan your research, and the basics of doing research. Good discussions with faculty members from different departments are shown, and they are quite rich. In my opinion, some written course materials summarizing the key points would have helped a lot to consolidate the key points. Nonetheless, I enjoyed doing the course!",4
100439,"Very thought provoking course. The online content was well presented, and the supporting reading was highly quality, relevant material that expanded my knowledge on this subject and I am sure it will be really helpful in improving my future research projects and planning. Highly recommended.",5
100440,"Didn't like the course though did only one week. In the first week you are supposed to write a research proposal. Though there is a lot of talk on what research is, no actual advice is given on how to write a sound research statement. What's more, with no knowledge on how to do it, you are supposed to assess the works of your peers. I doubt that inexperienced in research beginners will provide valuable feedback - at least I would never do it if I hadn't been quite experienced in that. The second week is devoted to the discussion of the importance of literature review. Isn't that obvious?",1
100441,Very good for an introduction to the basic ideas of research and why it is undertaken. Enjoyed it very much!,4
100442,"It was nice and abundant for the 'basic' understanding about research methods. It leads to the further more deepen methodological approaches. If you already know about qualitative or quantitative something, it will be easy for you however if you are unfamiliar any other methodological approaches, this course give you essential information about that.",5
100443,"Interesting course, provides a good insight for beginners. Wish there were more assignments and multi choice quizzes.",4
100444,"Solid and to the point. It will not get you ready to do a research, but it will give you the tools to design a solid enough draft or question for a research,",5
100445,"Content is good. I found the information in the videos valuable, albeit short and leaving me wanting more. I suppose that's what research is for. In general great and short course to get one on track with research methods.Take this course, as it is good.So why three stars?I know it is a long review, and feel free to remove it from the list, if you deem it appropriate. I have learned a lot in the course, and it is a valuable experience still.My problem lies with the design of the course, that seems to have started with great vigour at then lost the steam at the end. I would like to suggest few pointers. Especially since the presenters have another courses in the catalogue with similar issues.1. Help learners to focus - Body language, and position in the room. Standing in front of windows with the traffic outside may seem a minor thing, but it detracts form you and the content. As a course designer it is a responsibility to set it right. Same applies for hands in back pockets, posture when sat down, lens flare etc.2 - As instructors you have offered very little teaching. All was left to the guest speakers. All very good and knowledgeable. Some graphic and own mini lecture would help to establish you as experts (not that you are not, but we would not know that from the videos), rather than mere interviewers. (Summary of what was said).3 - match the video and e-tivity focus. And think about the accessibility of the material to your learners, especially if no previous knowledge is required. Week three was about managing research and planning. The reading, was surprisingly different (week 4 activity would be more suitable here) and really hard to access to someone, who hasn't done much reading in theories of knowledge etc. This would be more accessible as a guided lecture and quiz, rather than 400 words response.I hope I was not offensive to anyone. I was trying to help you to help us learn better, if that makes sense.M",3
100446,"This was a wonderful course, I would definitely take this again.",5
100447,Good on line course work in research methodology,5
100448,Should be a mandatory class before you have to do a research project.,4
100449,This course has given me a new energy to move on with my research. I loved the advice on the need to plan and manage well and to ensure one writes something everyday. Thank you and I look forward for more topics.,5
100450,"It is like for kids, I think all courses must mention their target audience. Contents, Videos, talks nothing was value for time.",1
100451,"This was a great introductory course. I particularly appreciated the text book chapter being included as it was a really useful resource. Compared to some other Coursera courses (quantitative and qualitative research methods) there were many fewer lectures and resources. That's why I rated it a 4/5. I'm getting more out of the other two, but this was a fantastic introduction to get me thinking.",4
100452,"I enjoyed the course, I will look for some other course from London University!",5
100453,I like the first E-tivity where we were asked to do the reading and listen to the video then come up with our own research question. I wished the rest of the course had continued along the same line where we can create a possible framework of what our research would have looked like by utilizing the ideas developed during the videos and readings.,4
100454,I am really impressed with the opinion and examples from different scholars on each topic of each lesson of the week. This gives me a better grasp on understanding Research Methodology Clearer which I couldn't even attain when I was in my unstandardized college in Cambodia. I'd definitely recommend this course to my fellow and junior classmates who wish to study research.,5
100455,"Instead of interviewing different people, it could have animations and infographics to explain the research methods.",3
100456,A really fantastic course for those who want to learn how to do great research!,5
100457,Excellent course for undergraduate students where ever they are!Thank You so much!,5
100458,Very nice course. Every students who wants to study abroad must do this course. Thank you University of London & Coursera.,5
100459,very informative with depth informantion,5
100460,Great Course,4
100461,Really Didn't like the course.,1
100462,"Great course, I managed to refine my research question through its assignments, and got a better idea of how to go about creating a good literature review. Have bookmarked most of the readings for future reference.",4
100463,Taking this course has indeed improved and deepened my intellectual rigor and it has motivated me to take additional courses on Research Methods from University of Amsterdam. The Course is an eye opener into the world of Research Methods.,5
100464,"If you are trying to understand what is a research and how to do one, this is the perfect start.",5
100465,very helpful!,4
100466,The interviewees give me the multiple ways to understand the Research. It is interesting and helpful!,5
100467,"Horrible. This course is too fun, too short, and a big teaser. The discussion forum is congenial and academically stimulating. I hope it leads to a follow-up continuation.",5
100468,This course is useful an helpful,5
100469,the assignment is creative and very brilliant and lessons is very short it is a pleasure to learn from you,5
100470,This course is really helpful in understanding research methods as well as adding up a lot of information,5
100471,i think that course is the best way to understanding concepts of research,5
100472,Best course to understand. What is research.,5
100473,its very good course,5
100474,"Great. Full of knowledge,Thank you.",5
100475,"it is really fantastic course , it helped me alto .",5
100476,It has many major points and tips that the one should know about before doing any search in any criteria.,5
100477,Very educative MOOC ~Loving it already!,5
100478,"This course is nicely organized and has manageable readings & videos. The video quality could be better. It's very very basic information about research. It might be useful to someone who does not know anything about it at all. The title might lead one to expect that methods of research such as qualitative, quantitative, and mixed method would be explored. Rather, this course is a general overview of what research is.",2
100479,"Came to know some basic research strategies. Enjoyed the assignments. Good course, catered for grad students but Undergrads can also benefit from the Reading material provided.",3
100480,very good course,5
100481,The course should be renamed as Basics of Research Method.,3
100482,so interesting and they got a very talented way of teaching,3
100483,"Very good course: doable, achievable, and feasible.",5
100484,"This course is a good introductory course on how to perform research and is well designed. Although the intended audience are students of various branches of study, the reading materials that are provided in the course concentrate more on social sciences. This is something that I as a computer science graduate feel hard to comprehend. If reading materials that are provided in the course address a general audience then it would be great",4
100485,Very good teachers and interesting videos.,5
100486,"Some parts were good but overall the course was lacking in its ability to add value. There were generic discussions. Week 3 was almost useless; had it not been for a good reading provided for an assignment, it was too basic.Add some specificity in the course or name it Basics of Research Methods.",3
100487,This is a good avenue to gather information and to contribute to the body of knowledge even at your smallest contribution!,5
100488,very helpful.,5
100489,very helpful!,5
100490,This course was basic yet covered many important elements for research design. It helped me to better understand the parts of design. The readings were relevant and the assignments were thorough enough to solidify main ideas. The videos were interesting. I would recommend the course for beginners.,4
100491,This is an excellent course to understand research methods.,5
100492,wonderful course,5
100493,very brilliant course,5
100494,"In terms of delivery, the course delivery was very simple, critical and relevant. The course content was very engaging as it included interviews with graduate students and professors alike who are doing their researches. Quite fittingly, I commend the creators of this course for recognizing the fact that most online courses on research methods out there focus on having a linear tackling of lesson topics. For this course, it stressed the key issues and reflections of individuals who are doing the actual rudiments of the thing we call ""research"". More importantly, this course was also critical and relevant in many respects as it allowed us to have some write-ups about the topics without requiring us to go through many readings. It is in this sense that I would say that it its relevant--concise and direct in its approach, the instructors have seen to it that what they are to discuss will be the things which new comers to the research endeavor might ask.Kudos to the team! And my warmest regards to all of you! =D",5
100495,A very fruitful effort and a nice MOOC by Univ of London allowing many many people/researchers across the globe to learn about state of art research methods which are usually not taught at MPhil or PhD levels.,4
100496,"The overall premise of the course is strong. Although I found the instructors and guest speakers extremely knowledgeable, quite a bit of the material was repetitive within in each week's video clip content.",3
100497,"Good course for anyone starting the journey of research. The course gives you an overview of the whole process in simple and easy way. Research work is challenging, however, this introductory course gives you some comfort when you hear the research scholars.",4
100498,It was a very instructive course and shed light about,5
100499,"It's a really good course to learn general parameters of research. However I think the E-tivity 3 wasn't clear some people did a summary from the reading, some others answered the questions from the reading and me tried to do a connection between the videos and the reading. These misunderstandings can have impact in the evaluation from the partners",4
100500,Helpful insight.,3
100501,wonderful course.,5
100502,"There was very little actual content in this course, and I can't say I learned very much. In hindsight, I wish I hadn't paid for a verified certificate.",2
100503,Excellent course to know and distinguish different approaches to the research question..,5
100504,clear and to point,5
100505,"course content was great, but I felt like the course left me hanging....",3
100506,"It's great to understand more of research methods in application, but I wish there were more resources provided to supplement our study. In general, this is a good course for those who start thinking of doing research in the future",3
100507,Thank you for the opportunity to participate in this class! The lessons challenged me in new ways I never expected!,5
100508,Great set up with attainable and realistic assignments that are relevant and thought provo for a new researcher.,4
100509,Not just a course but an activating tool. Thanks.,5
100510,"Intersting course you shouldn't miss, if you're in research design! *thumbsup*",5
100511,very useful for me to get to know something about research method. Thanks.,5
100512,Really useful course for ones who are thinking about career in science. Helped me a lot to understand how to write my PhD thesys and what I'm going to face while conducting my first recearch.Thank you very much!!!,5
100513,Good course indeed.,4
100514,"The course was of great help. It provides valuable insights to engage in academic research. However, I rate it only with three starts because I think it is too basic for the complexity involved in real research. Also I think some ideas provided in the course could be better organized. For example, in week three, the topic was understood to be something like ""Management Skills Applied to Research"" but the material pointed to something totally different. All ideas presented were great, but I think it is just matter to clarify better the objectives in each week.",3
100515,thanks a lot for this course i think that it will help me to progress in research practiceand to publish researches and to learn how to find answers to burning questions in my mind,5
100516,TOO SUPERFICIAL,1
100517,This is a great course,5
100518,Excellent and highly focussed. Very useful!,5
100519,Peer review evaluation for assignment work is a great way to foster collaboration and new ways of thinking.. what one reviewer might write could be varied from the next reviewer thereby the course adding a lot of value.,4
100520,"it´s very useful, pragmatic and didactic at the same time. Thank you to all the team that make it posible.",5
100521,"I enjoyed the interviews and the tips/suggestions offered in terms of assisting me as a ""new learner"" to make sure that I submit researchable topics and a research project that aligns to a good design process. Thank you to Coursera for the opportunity, you have done well.",5
100522,It is very short to feel like a real class. Video Lectures are too short too. I liked the readings.,3
100523,High quality content. Congratulations to the team!,5
100524,"Really helpful course, just the right length, from a prestigious University.",5
100525,great course,5
100526,"Great introduction to research methods for anyone contemplating a research masters of Phd. I haven't studied for a while, so found the course content particularly useful. Course is taught through a combination of videos, readings and weekly assignments which are peer reviewed. Weeks 2 and 3 of the course are particularly useful.",4
100527,It's really a very good course. I loved it!!!!!,5
100528,It's an amazing course with wonderful thought provoking activities!!,4
100529,very insightful,5
100530,"Great specialisation. It has been designed mainly for people who desire to become a professional journalism. This specialisation degree offers valuable journalistic techniques to write concise articles, not only that, but how to gather information in an ethical way.",5
100531,"As a guest writer for over 2 years and writing 70+ articles, with no prior formal training, I found this to be very refreshing to understand key concepts of journalism, especially on fairness, accuracy to promote credibility.This is a good course for those who not only beginners but people who written before and want to hone their values and concepts in journalism.",4
100532,"Outstanding! A fully immersed succinct package. Structured for engagement and retention. Excellent focus on ethics and values. Well prepared lectures and slides. Kept me on the edge of my seat all the way through. Highly recommend this one. I'll be signing up for the entire specialization.Tools you learn will be handy even if you aren't going into the news field directly: if you are social media manager, website content admin, newsletter editor...5 Full Stars. Thank you.",5
100533,Very pleased with the whole course. Teachers' delivery is easy to understand for the non-English speaking people like me. Happy and pleased.,5
100534,I enjoyed the course. Looking forward to the next 4 modules,5
100535,Well structured course and excellent distribution of content and variety.,4
100536,Excellent course and very very competent professionell lectures. I thank you all.,5
100537,"very engaging, and has shown me that credible content and engaging content do not have to be seperte from each other.",4
100538,"I did like the course, it was informative. However, there didn't seem to be enough interaction with the professors themselves, and the grading by peers didn't make me feel like I really deserved the grade I got. The quizzes were also really easy, which again, made me feel like I didn't deserve the grade. It would be great if we could have at least one short paper graded by the professors themselves with a limit of words so it wouldn't take up too much of their time.",3
100539,"Great course! I will most likely continue to take this series of courses! The professors/teachers are great, and can help when needed. The courses are simple and easy to use. Overall, great course!",5
100540,Amazingly presented.,5
100541,I am really excited through taking such as a wonderful about my passion called Journalism,5
100542,"Best course,thanks a lot!",5
100543,"Very informative, perfectly summarized introduction to journalism.",5
100544,It is practical and inspiraing. The exercises are easy to highly relevant to the course and also helpful for my job.,5
100545,Thank you very much.,5
100546,I rate this course 5 star because lectures are easy to understand.,5
100547,"The course is quite interesting, but I have not given it a 5 star because the quality of some videos is very poor.",4
100548,Very interesting and clear in the explanation. Engaging and effective. I'm waiting for the next step.,5
100549,This course is to the point the lessons are designed so that they can be accessible and they're broken down into smaller pieces so that they're not too much . the exercises are interesting since you have to keep in mind what you want to do with journalism yourself. They help you to organize this idea you might have in your mind or think about it.,4
100550,The course is great for beginners into the filed of learning to be reporting. I am happy i signed up for it though it was a bad time at work to focus on the course but I did. I look forward to completing the remaining courses required for specialisation. Thankyou coursera and the Michigan State University for the opportunity.,4
100551,Excellent course! Especially for people like me who are not majoring in journalism but always long to pursue journalism study in graduate school ! Journalism is so charming and thank all the teachers and Coursera works for presenting such a wonderful course for me. Thanks!,5
100552,This was a great opening course. It had a lot of details on how to be a responsible reporter.,5
100553,"I like it so much , thanks",5
100554,"The course is a well thought and masterfully set of lessons on the main principle of journalism: it talks ethics starting from maybe old concepts that surprisingly are still fitting today.Being a basic course, it is very easy to follow and finish. Quizzes are alternating between very good and very bad. Tough ethical decisions and a space to discuss them is a really great thing, but peer grading two phrases essays with only the ability of telling yes or no doesn't make for a good use of the crowdsourcing the very course is advocating.The videos seem to have been made with an indecent knowledge of the technology, especially for journalists who are supposed to use it daily; green screens were used so badly as some parts of the professors ""spark white"", and slides are often cut away and put back in view while the teacher is talking about it, which was downright infuriating.It still qualifies for a very good opening course in journalism, but needs serious improvement.",3
100555,I really enjoyed this introduction to journalism with lecturers from Michigan State University. I really like the video lectures as well as the added readings. It makes it feel like I am a student without needing to be at a campus. The videos are great! Each lecturer gives great explanations in such a short video making it easy to absorb the information. Highly recommend for those who definitely want to take the route of a journalist.,5
100556,This is 1 of 5 courses under Specialization for Journalism. I take the Specialization by installment payment (pay per each course). I found this course explains clearly on the general standards and the noble encouraging purpose and application on what journalism is all about. It is very informative to me and I am happy that I choose this Specialization and looking forward to learn the next lesson.,5
100557,I found much enthusiasm in this course really!,5
100558,Awesome opportunity to update your journalistic skills.,4
100559,Staff are incredibly arrogant bordering on aggressive. The very worst of the pontificating profession - and what we long term learners and educators know to be all too common. I couldn't stand it so I stopped. Would never recommend.,1
100560,A little bit to basic and some informations are useless beause they are part of the common knowledge. I also find quite a few technical issues when trying it in the first termin.,3
100561,interesting and clear.,3
100562,Through this course I could understand basics of journal,5
100563,A great place to start for blossoming journalists. This will teach you basic skills that you utilize many times in a journalism career.,4
100564,Awesome course on ethics of journalism and also describes how to gain the TRP news channel or websites etc. sensationalize the news,4
100565,"the course is great, does not request for previous knowledge, and at the end gives you a whole introduction of what mean journalism.",5
100566,"Great course! Some assingments are too easy, though. We might learn more of the material if they get a bit more challenging.",5
100567,"Easy to follow and really good advice, which automatically reminds one why one wants to become a Journalist.",5
100568,"Love it, clear, effective, perfect.",5
100569,Very well organized and explained. The ideas were easy to understand and follow as a native English speaker but was also inclusive for foreign learners as well. Gave a great introduction to Journalism and Ethics. I also appreciated that the length of the course was manageable for someone with a full time job.,5
100570,"I liked that it focus on new media, however I missed some text material to support the classes. Some minor mistakes on the exercises still need to be fixed. Some videos could be better produced, but the content is very good and I understand that it is also intended to be view on cellphones, so it was good.",4
100571,Great,4
100572,"Good: The video lectures cover a nice variety of topics giving you a good introduction of journalism, ethics, and other important considerations for becoming a journalist.Bad: The entire course feels hastily put together. Some of the videos have summarizing points, which is helpful when taking notes, but they flash on the screen briefly, then cut to a closeup of the lecturer, then cut back to the summery points so quickly that you can't copy them down and it becomes super distracting.The quizzes are a joke. They usually consist of 1-3 questions with two answers each and once choice so outrageous that they don't take any thought at all to complete. You could just skip to the quizzes without watching a single lecture and ""ace"" them easily.The assignments are also a joke. They ask for 1-2 sentence answers max! Some of them ask you to ""use more than one word"" to respond. I've taken free courses on here than involve 1000 word essays and then at least you're forced to process the information in the lectures. You can pass this course without watching a single lecture and that's a travesty to Michigan State.It is full of typos and oversights that could have been avoided if they had once person run through the course as a quality control. One of the quizzes has the answer included right beneath the question as a typo! The simple assignments are described in 3 different places, sometimes with conflicting instructions. They tell you what to do and how to review your peers in one section and then the actually assignment has different instructions on what to do than the page prior so you end up unsure of what the assignment actually wants you to do. For example: the final assignment at firsts asks you how to engage with your audience, and then you click next and the SAME question is now asking you how you distribute content. Did they even try??In Summery: The content in the lectures are a good but shallow overview of journalism, but don't expect to be challenged to do anything but fill in ovals and regurgitate questions.Not too much to learn here.",2
100573,Really good course and I never felt a moment of boredom while studying it,5
100574,"As a beginning course in journalism, this has been a true experience for me. I learned more than I thought I would about ethics, professionalism, and how to be true to your story.",5
100575,This is a well designed course that's easy to follow and understand. It's informative and is just as it's described.,5
100576,"It is a good introductory course, but the technical aspect for this module is bad...",3
100577,great course,5
100578,Excellent course material and good learner participation. I think a stronger instructor presence will round it off nicely (even if only in the forums). Great presentation Mr Grimm!,5
100579,"I love it! This course is fun and informative, I'm proud to be enrolled.",5
100580,"I haven't finished, yet, but it seems to be very informative and helpful",5
100581,I am still taking this course and I am really excited to take the other courses in the specialization. The topics are covered with in- depth analysis and I am very much satisfied with course content.,4
100582,Great course. Am gunning for the complete specialization,5
100583,Great course,5

100591,"The course is great for getting an overview of business growth strategy. If I had a recommendation to even improve the course further, it would be helpful to receive a bit more details on the concepts introduced.",5
100592,really interesting but also really difficult to finish the assignment. it would have been great to get a sample assignment just to get an idea of how it could look like,3
100593,"Good course, but I think the previous courses of the specialization are better organized and structured than this one.",3
100594,real business scenarios for growth and also pitfalls ..excellent and focused approach.,4
100595,Material is very fruitful.,5
100596,excelent to have a general view and insights of growth strategies,5
100597,Good elaborate course,5
100598,"Really enjoyed the course guys - thanks very much for investing the time required to offer this to the masses! The videos were great - brief, succinct lessons to discuss valuable, applicable tools for optimizing growth strategy.Cheers,",4
100599,loving it .. very informative,5

100602,Excellent course and teachers!!,5
100603,Very good information and tools !!!!!,5
100604,Very useful and insightful,5
100605,"At first I didn't see this course as particularly interesting, but with the first week's lectures I understood its approach and I believe it is a very important aspect of business strategy.Overall, the entire specialization gives a wide range of tools to be used in a company or a new venture with spectacular results.I highly recommend any or all of the courses offered in this specialization.",5
100606,Excellent course. Continue building on the basics of the prior two courses (Business Strategy & Advanced Business Strategy) which is part of the specialization offered. The professors are fantastic and the course material very relevant to those with a focus on picking up the basics of business strategy.,5
100607,Very useful course.,5
100608,Superb Initiative ... highly brief yet informative ... thank you for your support ... cheers,4
100609,Good and useful course,5
100610,It was really a knowledge worthy program.,5
100611,It was a very good course to learn and know things about Social Media. I am not pretty sure about Peer Grading system though.,4
100612,A very useful course to get a basic hang of social media in a short span of time!,5
100613,"A short, simple and to the point very practical course.",5
100614,AMAZING COURSE,5
100615,The course was really helpful and it will benefit me a lot,5
100616,Great learning experience,5
100617,This four week course is useful. It nicely captures the details of social media planning in an easy-to-understand learning model.,4
100618,it is perfectly structured for working professionals,5
100619,An amazing course that offers in-depth information about the application of social media in public relations.,5
100620,Liked the coursre very much cause it provides you with basics and teach to learn independently. As usual the course stimulates you for self development and learning and this is very beggining. All depends on you!,5
100621,Thank's Dr. Tracy Loh,5
100622,"Thank you, it's a good course. I only wish I could take quiz without purchase a course. I don't need a certificate but I'd like to check my knowledge. That is what quiz for.",4
100623,repetitive.. long.. too academic... unnecessary terms.... The instructor voice is annoying after 2 minutes. Blah.,2
100624,"Structured beginner course for those who have no background in PR/Social Media. For those currently working in the domain, you'll find yourself skipping through parts of the course as you most likely have already known the stuff. Nonetheless, it provides a framework and examples to take a leaf from!Unfortunately, I didn't purchase the course hence unable to submit the quizzes + graded assignment.",4
100625,"I believe you won't learn something really new from this course. If you are familiar with PR, the content is probably common sense. However, this course is extremely effective in organizing all these ideas in order to maximize the way you apply them. For example, we all know that, as a company, we have to engage with our costumers, right? That's common sense. What we don't know is what are all the possible levels of engagement and how can we make the most out of each level.I strongly recommend taking it.",5
100626,So many valuable information in this course.But professor can surely present it in better way.,3
100627,"Well taught, informative and clearly delivered. I loved the real-life examples that hit home the concepts and the thorough, scientific approach to each lesson. It gave me an interesting foundation in the psychological reasons behind certain effective social media methods.",5
100628,It was difficult to me! I think that 's more appropriate to whom is already familiarized with the terms and concepts.,2
100629,This cours is really well prepared and very interesting! Thank you very much for making it!,5
100630,"Enjoyable course, final assignment was a bit time-consuming but a good way to apply everything learned.",4
100631,I must say that this is indeed a ground-breaking course that will guarantee PR success in this digital era for any PR professional,5
100632,"Very informative, I had a bit of trouble with notetaking though, sometimes info you needed was all over the place, alot of stop and rewind but still a good course",4
100633,One of the most handy and crisp course content. very useful for people who are in PR.,5
100634,I need more practical example related to mentioned theories and concepts in lectures,2
100635,Excellent class. Highly recommended.,5
100636,"Very informative and good explained course. I have learnt valuable things, thanks to Mrs. Loh! The only thing i would complain about are the uncertain and a bit vague instructions for the assignment. It should be stated clearer f.ex. which theories are meant and a more explicit way of instructing the editorial calendar, f.ins. a template or something like that. Nonetheless a very valuable and good made and lucid experience!",4
100637,Loved it!,5
100638,"excellent course , taught me so much about social media which i did not know before.",5
100639,Excel seems not like the ideal tool for portfolio optimization. A business plan or a net value calculation would have been much more in the spirit of this specialization,3
100640,Too much focus on portfolio investments topic. Would expect more on modeling principles in broader context.,2
100641,"For peer review: I wuold add the possibility, by the valuated candidate, to express a counterback valuation on the person who assigned him/her the vote, relative on the efficacy of the suggestion and the consistency of the judgement on his work.",4
100642,":The course capstone was very disappointing. it has nothing to do with business and financial modeling, it is nothing more than a very questionable portfolio construction exercise on optimized weights and parameters. Not only such a portfolio is pretty unrealistic, but it has nothing to do with business modeling!",1
100643,Excellent capstone to review and put in practice all the learned in the past courses. Excellent course to be a invesment manager.,5
100644,Really a great set of courses to understand and apply models to many different scenarios. I was able to use the skills I learned right away in my profession. Would definitely recommend.,5
100645,"Really interesting course. I especially enjoyed the capstone project, which had a lot to do with portfolio construction in the real world. There are many real-world applications for this course and I highly recommend it!",5
100646,This context of this capstone was great. I was able to learn about finance and apply the tools that I learned in preceding courses to complete this project successfully.,5
100647,Brilliant!,5
100648,Go to core points in Financial Modeling and great knowledge to apply into reality.,5
100649,"Too easy, no direct feedback. But a good refresher, though",4
100650,"Seemed like the Capstone was rushed and turned into an Investment Management course...I signed up to practice business finance modeling not investment management. The instructors did not present any further information and referred students to third-party resources (ie, Investopedia and Youtube). Many students in the forums voiced their frustration. Disappointing course with little added value, and in my opinion, hurts Wharton's image.Overall, the Wharton Online Business Finance Modeling Specialization is not worth the ~US$550. If I could I would ask for a refund.",1
100651,"Greate Course so Far, A lot Fininance.",5
100652,Excellent course! Great information and guidance for anyone interested in this field.,5
100653,wonderful course. must do,5

100659,100% Recommended for everyone,5
100660,"Dr. Quentin McAndrew's ""Business Writing"" is a strong course. It can be a applied to all forms of business writing; documents, memos, emails, video scripts, and web copy. Be warned, you will never look at another email from your colleagues the same way again.",5
100661,It was a very nice experience to be a part of this course. I have learnt a lot about effective writing and many hidden tips that we often ignore while writing.,5
100662,A really good course on business writing,5
100663,This course on Business Writing is very helpful. It has helped me to gain basic knowledge on Business writing. This has also made a good impact on my work and produce better results with positive outcomes.,4

100668,Easy to understand and really helpful.,5
100669,Loved the course. The instructors are awesome. I just wish I could have taken the quizzes. I couldn't take them because I chose to enroll for the audited version of the course. I learnt the major concepts of business writing. Moving forward I will have to keep the primary principles in mind.,5
100670,Learned easy tips to improve my writing skills! Highly recommend.,5
100671,"The writing instructor is great, and the ideas are good. I didn't like the interaction sessions with the other two instructors, i want to learn about writing not hear about other stuff or listen to some folks at a cafe. I thought it was a waste of time. Also, I didn't like that the example used was a memo for Coursera about their own course! They could have picked something more interesting. Good ideas, not ideal execution.",3
100672,This course taught me new skills for outlining and self-editing that have already improved my writing process.,5
100673,I enjoyed the course very much. It is perfectly structured and delivered. You got me inspired!,5
100674,"Thanks you very much for teaching this course!You taught this course well. First, you introduced the vital principals of good writing. Second, you taught scaffolding, a useful tool to organise. Third, you taught techniques for revision. Lastly, you link course to design and presentation, a natural extension of writing in business world today (how i wish to go back to the old days when there are no presentations).I found the videos slightly too brief to let the idea or technique to sink in. This can be augmented by additional reading material. Also, to allow techniques become second nature, it will be even better if there are more exercises. A option to do more exercises can be a good idea. You can consider putting this into a book!by the way, my scaffold below lol-principals-scaffold-techniques for revision-it links to graphic design and presentation-more examples and practices",4
100675,This course is useful basically in all spheres of life. Thumbsup,5
100676,The course is interactive with short videos and useful quizzes. I totally recommend it to anyone who wants to improve their writing skills.,5

100683,Excellent course- good writing tips for Engineers & Scientist.,4
100684,The classes and assignments were worth the time and effort because my writing is better. The facilitators have done a brilliant job arranging the course and specialisation.,5
100685,Excellent course to learn the basics of business writing.,4
100686,"basic but very useful skills and tips.easy style (good articulation, short videos, discussion from time to time) which is good for people with full-time jobs.Lecturers organize a few events on Facebook and recommendations of reading from time to time --> a good approach of social and staying connected.",5
100687,Awesome course!!,5
100688,"This course on business writing has been extremely useful to me. There were parts which were more general and simple, and others which gave specific advice, but all of them taught something new. I would strongly recommend it to anyone who wants to get his message across effectively and efficiently at work. And don't worry if you're not a native English speaker, because I'm a Spanish student and had no problem at all! I am going to take the next course of the Specialization Programme without a doubt.",5
100689,It was excellent!!,5
100690,Excellent course with a clear and practical application. I've recommended for my team to enroll.,5
100691,"Great course!For me this course ended too quickly. I think the business writing aspect of this specialization can be divided into two or three courses, so that we may get more time to practice and learn new things.",5

100699,"This course forces you to think about how well you communicate. It emphasizes a ""clear and to the point"" style. Your writing may not change drastically overnight, but just being aware of the concepts taught in this course will help you improve.",5

100701,It is valuable and useful course to develop the writing skill.,5

100705,"Awesome course, I never realized how fun a course could be. I am learning a ton of stuff and am passing all the quizzes and assignments so far and the professors are so easy to learn from, they really thought of everything when programing this business writing course. I would recommend that anyone that is thinking of writing as a career that you will learn a lot and that any career you are going for that writing will help you in every way.",5

100717,"If you want to be a professional writer, go for this course!",5
100718,"If you are not familiar with AI, you can learn its basic ideas in this course. However, 1. No moderators or teaching assistants answer questions in the discussion forum. 2. No slides are provided for preview and review. 3. The lecturer is very good, but the contents are basic. More state-of-the-art, practical materials would help a lot. 4. Some vides are too fast to follow.",3
100719,Great course!,5
100720,great course,5
100721,The material was enough to take one from basics to the advanced level of accounting.,5

100730,Rather useful,5
100731,Interesting and perspective course,4
100732,Excellent for people who want to have a basic and solid knowledge about organic solar cells in all its aspects. Great material and great tutors!,5
100733,"The lessons are not very clear and have almost no examples. To make matters worse, the discussion forums were closed so you could not ask anything to clarify things, so it was very difficult to learn things here.",1
100734,"I like it is a really complete and innovative course. Giving the broad and precise overview of OPV, which is a big field of development today. I would like it to be a little more alive, as the main topic is evolving really fast. Altough it was good for me not to have a fixed schedule to complete it, I would like it to be more up to date and maybe making a bigger course or other parts for more specialised parts or new applications or research the team is doing. Thanks anyway for the course. It was really worth it for somebody interested in PV.",5
100735,"Pretty good, worth doing to learn the ins and outs of this promising technology.",4
100736,A nice course introducing you to the world of organic solar cells,5
100737,"Quite interesting course which I definitely recommend to follow.

Thanks so much.",5
100741,"I highly recommend this couse for everyone, who are interested in Organic Solar Cells. The videos are thoughtful and taking notes while listening, is easy. The additional reading materials are well written and insightful. If you are familiar with basic organic chemistry, chemical bonds and conjugation and with band theory, the course is pretty easy to master.",5
100742,thanks for this course. everything is well explained. we wish to get a course on pervoskite solar cells too.,5
100743,It shows you how OPV works (which is a breakthrough technology) in a simple way without leaving the technical aspects of it.It's a serious course that requires full compromise to achieve it.,5
100744,"This is a very complete and well-structured course which do not only teach general ideas in the way that an introduction course does, but actually goes deeper into the science, economics and industrial aspects of the organic solar cells.I have widely increased my knowledge about this topic without making hard efforts, just enjoying while I was learning, so that's the reason why I fully recomend you to do it if you have some interest in solar energy.",5
100745,"Very interesting, really enjoy this course",5
100746,Thank you for the opportunity to learn. The material is foreign to me but explained simply. I plod forward.,5
100747,"Quality of the video and sound are bad; a few minutes after starting a lesson, sound goes off or picture holds and moves no more... This made me stop the course.",1
100748,"In my opinion, the final exam was weak since it was compacting the quizzes throughout the course. The content could be 50% theory and 50% practice which i consider that it was more theoretical.",3
100749,"Absolutely brilliant course, excellent content. Only problem is that it is impossible to get help if you need support.",4
100750,Good Course,5
100751,"the course is very helpful,easy to understand ,reading materials were good too.",5
100752,"Great! Nice layout, good and thorough presentation of almost all the relevant matter. Also the people presenting it are really nice and not that American-ish over the top enthousiasm.",5
100753,Detailed systematic and very informative. Nicely presented too.,5
100754,Very informative course,5
100755,Interesting tha,3
100756,"难度适中，讲解清晰，深入浅出，解决了一些困扰我很久的问题。值得推荐This course is of great help to me. As an undergraduate majoring in applied chemistry, there is no course set in my home school covering this area, though I have some experiments related to do. Thus, I got confused and this course really frees me from that.",5
100757,Very enriching course. A lot of materials that will familiarize learners with most of the current topics in Organic Solar Cells. Review from a Material Science student.,5
100758,"The assignments should be flexible, i.e we should be given the score based on what we have answered and provided an opportunity to re-take them if we have to improve the score further instead of having a strict policy of getting all the answers correct in order to complete an assignment.Further the lectures were as though the faculty is reading out from a board in front of them (with an exception of Frederik Krebs), and thus many concepts were only touched on the surface. For people with not much background in organic chemistry understanding PEDOT:PSS and other chemical components we tough.A suggestion would be to increase the class duration and explaining the concepts in a more clear way.",3
100759,Good course with very good cause and reference material.,5
100760,"Fenomenal course, you learn all the basics of organic solar cells in great detail, you have extra material to read, tutorials, and live sessions. I think it should have more exercises or peer reviewed assignments so that you can explain processes and get parameters of the cell.",5
100761,Not enough information is provided to pass some of the quizzes without extensive additional research into organic chemistry or other topics. There is no help forum or feedback from instructors,2
100762,I learned new skills and theory about OPV. It's a very comprehensive and well structured course. I recommend it to every person who wants to improve their knowledge in solar panels technology.,5
100763,No forum + No email + No support whatsoever = Very frustrating,1
100764,A good introduction to the Organic Solar Cells world.,4
100765,I find the course very helpful. I'm a climate&energy officer at WWF but sometimes even I couldnt find enough arguments to discuss the silicon use in PV and convince people on fast developing PV techs. Thank you so much for introducing the world 3rd generation solar cells.Note: It would be very helpful if next time instructors can talk more clearly and show more examples.Thanks for you efforts.Cheers.,5
100766,very enlightening and easy to grasp,5
100767,"You can really feel the passion and experience the facilitators have on this OPV subject, even via the videos. This course is a must for people interested to delve into OPV, especially as a starting point for research. The course covers into detail almost from cradle to grave about OPV, and what I like most is that they highlighted a lot of previous and current experiments and research regarding OPV. Some of the quizzes can be a bit challenging as a few of them require 100% to pass. But all in all, 5 stars for me. Congratulations on a course well done.",5
100768,"HiFirst of all I just want to write I have a background in mechanical engineering and I know the working principles of solar cells quite well. I just wanted to check out this course.I started this course but I find that it is very difficult to concentrate. I tried pinpointing exactly what the problem was and I came up with following:There is too much talking and not enough going on visually. I know you have a person in front of a white screen, and a few visual effects such as floating words and diagrams. It is just not working for me. I have a hard time remembering what you said. I can pause and go back again which is always nice but the info still doesn't stick. This especially true for the LCA part, which I don't even think is a difficult concept to grasp.I think the best courses I have seen online is not particularly rehearsed and it is usually just a guy, with a pen, running you through some examples to illustrate the working principles. Afterwards they do an everyday life example. I find that these courses always help me a lot.I am sorry about the 2 stars but I hope you see it as a room for improvement. It is probably a first time for you guys to use an online platform as a media so it will take a couple of iterations to get it right.I did like when you illustrated Isc and Voc in terms and abbreviations. More stuff like that, possibly also with an electrical diagram etc and som flow analogy.If I can propose anything it would be to organize it a bit more like Michigan Universitys Python learning series. I think it is quite good and the assignments are also challenging but you learn a lot.Anyway thanks a lot for the course. I hope you will find a way that works.",2
100769,Had an amazing time learning. It was a respite from my mundane job.,5
100770,"The course is great and the instructors very very knowledgeable. I am grateful to have been able to take this course. , but in the recorded session in quite a few places, the voice either fades away or is muted. It feels like we are missing some important stuff.",4
100771,It is a great topic to cover and attracts a lot of attention and interest.,5
100772,A few more technical aspect input will make the course better....,4
100773,scarce material for weekly study,3
100774,Really liking it though am still in week one :),4
100775,"I love the scale-up part of the course. It gives me a great insight of upscaling of solar cells. But in general, the course is lack of content in depth. I would prefer a more hard core course with detailed explanation of the working mechanism of solar cells.",3
100776,this is a nice course,5
100777,"I would give this course a five based on the content it provides, but it lacks in three key areas. First, no forums, really? This is how we learn when we have NO instructor or TA support. They also lack workable calculations. Second, there was a GLARING error in a quiz that no one caught, showing a near complete lack of understanding of energy conversion. Third, the quiz engine has had a number of errors in the calculations. specifically in formula formatting. These are advanced systems that clearly need more testing. But all in all, this is GREAT content if you want to learn about organic (polymer OPV) solar cells.",4
100778,"Very good course overall.There was a problem with the formulas in several quizzes, though. One couldn't get the app to reflect a formula properly, which resulted in the questions being qualified as wrong.Otherwise nice, interesting courseCongrats, and thanks for sharing your knowledge folks!",4
100779,Excellent course to understand the course from scratch on Organic solar cells . Generates huge interest and builds great curiosity to find solutions to some of the limitations that are there with photo voltaic cells..,4
100780,Thanks all of you who give their time to level us.,5
100781,"From the child hood i am interested in photo voltaic s but i didn't get the right place to know about the solar energy.now my quest for the knowledge in this field is going to full fill through this course,the DTU course team put tremendous efforts to bring forward this course to the course era community,excellent job.",5
100782,"Very informative, and presented in such a manner that the instructors' passion is evident throughout the course!",5
100783,"Pretty hard, but you can really learn a lot from it.Make you time worthy.",5
100784,Found it very useful for improving the knowledge on the Organic Solar Cells. thanks for all the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) for providing us such a vital opportunity to improve our knowledge in this domain. I am hoping for few more courses that can enhance my knowledge related to OPV's,5
100785,"Great course, lots of material but really well presented. Touches all aspects of the organic solar cell production and the physical and chemical fundamentals behind it.",5
100786,Where is the material? There is nothing under any of the weeks lectures.,1
100787,"Great introduction to the state, opportunities and challenges associated with Organic Photovoltaic systems.",4
100788,Great introduction to a very promising technology!,4
100789,I learned so much in this course!,5
100790,I like this but there is quite a bit of data and info to cram.,4
100791,"I started the course with high hopes, and i was beginning to enjoy the subject matter. But it became very tough for me to continue because the sound in the videos was not very clear. It became very difficult understanding what the instructors said, either because the placement of the mic was not very good or the instructors were not speaking very clearly",2
100792,Very good!Thank you.,5
100793,"Extremely light on information, no discussion forums.",1
100794,"The course gave me a good, in-depth understanding of OPVs and how further developing the technology surrounding them could help solve the energy crisis. The material was thorough and the quizzes were challenging without being frustrating and encouraged you to learn more about the topics discussed. My only problem was that I was unable to access a community forum so a few times I was stuck on an assignment and had no way to find out information to help me. Instead I just had to guess and work through it alone which wasn't horrible but I would have like to have been able to discuss it with other people taking the course. Overall a good course that has gotten me very excited about OPVs and the future of solar technology.",4
100795,Wonderful course. Learnt a lot. Covered every aspect of cheap environment friendly energy option in this new technology of organic solar cell.,5
100796,"The most valuable insight was at the end.We can be so focused on efficiency of solar conversion that we forget it is not the only factor in producing a useful product. I know this but the specific example embeds the insight to better use it in other situations.Overall the course gave a good overview, though it was a mixture of the very simple (calculations) and difficult (the explanation of the polymers) that needed more pointers to appropriate further reading.Useful to know that the effect of cell shadowing in the series cells has a small effect on output. I hope the project gets funding to continue the research.",4
100797,Fantastic course. i would like to have some certificate of acomplishment,5
100798,Maybe I missed the pre-requisites - I was unable to complete some of the questions correctly because I did not see any examples of how to answer the questions calling for calculations of formulas.,4
100799,"The course was a very nice introduction to OPV, the material is pretty good and the lessons were punctual. I have just three tings to take into consideration:1- I am colorblind, so, I recommend you to identify each line on the lesson ""Characterization of Polymers"" because I had to ask somebody which color was each curve.2- I recommend you to add a little bit more information about conjugated polymers.3- It would be amazing if you make a document in pdf with all the reading materials (I would pay for it even though the information is free in your page, because is more easy to check a document than a webpage).",5
100800,"Too much practices and industries, but a little about the theory.",3
100801,Too much formula based. Needs to be little more interesting.,4
100802,Great learning experience. A new way of learning things which interests you most.,5
100803,Very much helpful and interesting too. The various chapters included a deep analysis of the solar cell which is nowhere else to found and easily learnt ! I would like to personally thank the truly great Professor for his efforts teaching me about the solar cell from the scratch to a great level.,5
100804,FOR THE SOLAR LOVING PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD !!! LOVIN IT !!,4
100805,"The course is a good introduction to Organic Photovoltaics. The instructors have done a good job to present a rather complicated topic in a manner that is accessible to a common audience.However, there are a few areas of improvement that can be noted for future versions of this course:First, All material is given equal priority in the course. I think what the instructor can do is to summarize the important ""take aways"" at the end of each video lesson. This helps the learner grasp the concept betterSecond, The explanation can be a little clearer - especially the topic of polymerization. Someone without an organic chemistry background, can find it frustratingly hard.Third, the tests are sometimes not in line with the previous video lessons and the reading material. The tests should be much much sharper.Fourth, the reading material should be improved vastly in terms of English quality, structure and presentation of key points. Sometimes, the learner can find it hard to understand some topics (ex: stability and materials) because it is inadequately explained. These topics should be explained better.Overall, a great start - but can be better. Well done and Thank You!",3
100806,Very recommended course for beginners in Python and programming. 100% satisfied =),5
100807,This course is really great.Enjoyed learning organic solar cells. Thank you for such a wonderful course.,4

100810,"If you have some interest about that subject this videos are for you. Since first video, that guys energy come into you and you really struggle for learn it and understand them.",5
100811,This is an exceptional course which will let you know all the basics required.,5
100812,For any person that wants to learn more about clean energy this is the course you might want to grow your knowledge,5
100813,I learn a lot. My objective is manufacturing this OPV and I found everything that I need to put in action my plan.Thanks for all.,5
100814,Very good for getting an overview of the field.,5
100815,Excellent curriculum and staff. Assignments are productive and lectures are informative,5
100816,Great one!!,5
100817,"It was very tough, but it worth it! Thank you so much! I would like to suggest you to change the final grading system. In some projects there were good merketing part, foe example, but operations and financial plans were abscent. But the question it the grading is about the whole course in general. Another common problem is that by the end of the reviewed project you still don't know what exactly is the product, so you can't actually answer on all these questions.Thankful in advance! And many thanks for interesting specialization!",5
100818,The majority of the lecture videos were engaging and the structure provided you to move at your own speed.,4
100819,It was my first specialization and I had a wonderful time completing it.I am looking forward for Business Analytics and Entrepreneurship capstone from Wharton Online.Thank you...!!!!,5
100820,"Great course. I did a project relating to my career (construction), so the process of researching and putting together a presentation directly improved my understanding of the industry.",5
100821,This is a great course!,5
100822,"A must-have set of skills to everyone seeking a better and comprehensive understanding about operations, finance and marketing analysis.",5
100823,"Not worth the money. The material is weak ,and the peer-grading process is very casual.",1
100824,Excellent course. Highly recommended,5
100825,"Very well organized, lead and makes you apply all the skills you've acquired on all of the courses in real life example! Enjoyed while working on the Capstone!",4
100826,This is a very good course for beginners as well as professional in the business management field. It is very through with regards to course materials and resources provided through out this course. The Capstone Project gives you an very hands on experience in making a business plan which is the base to start any new venture.,5
100827,"It was a great learning experience. If I may, I would have like if I had additional guidance while developing my financial plan for the project. It was very unclear about how to go about setting up the financial values etc. Some extra help would have been appreciated.",4
100828,Good course. Accounting course was the best,4
100829,An amazing experience. A lot more work than i thought it would be!,5
100830,"Good idea / intend, horrible execution.",2
100831,"Excellent assignment, the most demanding I have seen so far on Coursera. Hope to be able to take it successfully the second time.",5
100832,I enjoy the challenge.,5
100833,"The challenging way this Capstone is presented forced me to improve in several topics of this specialization. I strongly recommend that if you have a personal project, you can discover a whole world of opportunities for your new business throughout every week.",5
100834,"Peer review at times leaves a lot to be desired, esp geography specific biases. I would request that my final capstone submission be reviewed by course staff. I got very low scores whereas I think I did a good job on it covering all required domains extensively.",4
100835,"This course is a challenge, but it provides a lot of knowledge that you can not learn from the textbook. It gives us a opportunity to try, to imagine, to think. I believe it can help many students to improve themselves.",5
100836,"The lecturer picked the most famous authors from Han dynasty to Minguo. His broad knowledge on both eastern and western literature guided the students to explore the similarities and difference between the two cultures, also led the students to understand the essence behind the selected literature.",5
100837,"Hello,I already finished the cours. The cours show me ways and procedures to make plannings and schedule controls things that I was looking for since long time. I strongly recommend the cours for planners initiators and budget schedulers.Best regards,Henry Capellan",5
100838,"Very informative, full of live samples and interactive learning, highly recommending it!",5
100839,"An excellent introduction to resilience in children affected by war, terrorism and disaster. I appreciated very much the opportunity to meet (virtually) many experts in the field including the course instructor Dr. Masten as well as getting to know about many forums and centers related to this field. Very timely.",5

100865,I learned a lot in just four weeks! I recommend if you are a beginner in project management.,5
100866,Evaluation tests are blocked.,4
100867,"Great Course, maybe you could have the sildes for download so you can study them",4
100868,The Quizzes are written in a very tricky way. It's supposed to be a course for beginners.,2
100869,"This is a great introductory course to project management. The material is delivered very well and the material well chosen. The only negative I have is that some of the lectures are quite long, compared to other online courses I have done and I think would have benefited from some mini quizzes during the lectures to keep the student engaged and ensure that the material stuck. In the past I have worked as a project manager on software projects and I wish I had taken this course before starting the job. It would have helped a lot.",4
100870,Outstanding course. The instructor looks very experienced and the examples she demonstrated were very good. She explained each concept in detail which a person can use in his/her project. I will definitely refer my friends to take this course.,5
100871,Very helpful and interesting. I like it,5
100872,Like the concise format of the course. It helps me to look the project from different prospective and I tried to use it practically to plan my project during this course. I recommend this course to anyone who wants fair amount of knowledge in very limited time.,5
100873,Great course.,4
100874,"I enrolled for the course with some hesitance as I had done another MOOC on project planning and management and by the end the course it looked like rocket science. This time, I admit I have learned. I now know the fundamentals which to me a a good foundation and I have acquired valuable skills. The facilitator was an excellent communicator and the content very good. I actually feel I can now apply what I have learned with confidence.",5
100875,"This course is in my opinion an extremely good starting point to approach project management both for professional or simply curiousIt is dense enough to give a complete picture of matter on one hand, and require a limited time effort on the oder.The speacking is so clear, pronunciation lively, never boring or soporific.Quizzes are affordable, however not banalI recomend this course to evrybody, even for just general skillI thank you so much Yael Grushka-Cockayne and hope to encounter her again in other course",5
100876,Course material is very good. And overall experience was nice. Learned about basics of Project Management. Thanks a lot.,4
100877,An overall great learning experience.,5
100878,Best course....Highly recommendable for aspiring / Upcoming Project Managers...,5
100879,"very good introduction, lot of concepts, lot of recommended tools... a bit more examples and practical work would give this course 5 stars, even if it takes more time to complete...",4
100880,"I gained a lot from this course, but perhaps not as much as expected even considering it is a fundamentals course. I had hoped to learn a bit more depth, rather than the few basic concepts actually covered. That being said, the instructor did mention at the very beginning which aspects would be skipped and which would be covered, and those covered were covered very well, with the possible caveat that the instructor tended to teach as standard methods that were her preference or background. Additional research on my own turned up a wider variety of PM techniques that were not even mentioned.Overall, worth taking, especially as a very basic introduction for those who (like me) had no previous PM experience.",3
100881,Full of awesomeness,5
100882,I found the course very nice. Perhaps it would be yet better if the tests were more diverse.,4
100883,"Loved this course, it was such a pleasant experience to learn something new and and at the same time very valuable to your career.",5
100884,Very helpful content in a clear delivery process.,5

100888,"Very useful course with practical examples and tutorials on MS Project included. Learned some new things such as stakeholder power/interest grid, SPI and CPI that I haven't used before.",5
100889,Good introduction to project management.,5
100890,helped me to get some basic knowledge on Project Management process,3
100891,Very helpful course on the fundamentals of project management. It covers all the basics in order someone to fit project management procedures on his needs.,5
100892,This is a very useful course.By applying these (even basic concepts) we will be more confident in achieving better results in our projects plan and developments.,5
100893,very glad i cracked all the four weeks and thank you for giving this opportunity looking for more number of courses to be taken.,5
100894,"Great course, lots of useful information and fast track learning approach!",5
100895,"Good and interesting course on the basics of project management. Videos are very clear and the information is good accessable. It could be stuffed in 1 week but spread it out over 4 weeks is better to let it sink in. It may be interesting to add a quick overview of other management styles, for example, for projects with very high uncertainties and different types of business.",4
100896,A nice launching off point!,5
100897,Excellent and focused material with quiz designed to test the fundamentals. Great work!,5

100900,"its a great course, i learn new bases of managing my projects",5
100901,"Excellent course, thanks for all the useful tools you provide.",5
100902,"After completing this course, I could classify it as a must-have for those who must to perform management tasks or activities.I would like to stand out the teaching quality, knowledge and expertise of the instructor (Yael Grushka-Cockayne), just like all the people behind like the Mentor in the Discussion Forum (Vijayakumar Menon N.). It's really remarkable their efforts to make easy all the matters dealt with clear examples and notes.The contents are very update and they give some very interesting references to other examples and tools which could very useful to check for more detailed information.It would be really interesting a second course about this subject, a bit more detailed and focused on the project execution with the use of specialized tools for that goal (JIRA, Redmine, Trac Project...).To conclude, I recommend this course for those people who want to begin with project management activities or those who are working on these and they want to strengthen their skills and capabilities.",5
100903,"Great Course for learning Project Managment, helpfully for learn about terms that could be news for me in the area",5
100904,very very fine,5
100905,Excellent course! Well taught and easier to understand for someone who is new to this area.,5
100906,"The course was quite interesting and provided lots of literature sources for further reading. The instructor was lovely and pleasant-to-listen. The content was very easy to understand and pretty diverse. However, I was not satisfied with the fact this MOOC can be finished by passing 4 simple tests in order to achieve the grade. I definetely wanted to practice the knowledge deeper in the weeks' assignments.",4
100907,"The course provides fundamentals as advertised, but the delivery was not impressive. For example the lecturer's speech interrupts, changing words and thought-flow. Examples given were not well thought-out, for example HR was said to be hard-set because it was ""outsourced"" which doesn't make sense. Another example would be where the lecturer said that ""stand-up meetings"" mean no body is allowed to sit down?! Generally, seems to me the course was filmed in a hurry and wasn't delivered good enough for a rating above the basic fundamental two stars.",2
100908,"This was a great course for as through the course I was trying to plan a project too. Now I'm on track, not quite on budget but it's ok with the manager of our company.",5
100909,"For a short course, I learned a lot of PM best practices from this course. I really enjoyed learning about network diagrams, understanding critical paths, calculating total project durations and understanding the the project performance metrics through earned value analysis. While I have been a PM at a small company, which is mainly an Agile shop, I found this coursework to provide a good understanding of project management principles in general. I recommend this course to beginners and intermediate PMs alike.",5
100910,"I enjoy your teaching,I hope to work with you again soon,bita edalati",5
100911,I loved this course! It was super easy to follow and understand with absolutely no experience in management since I'm still only a freshman. I was motivated all throughout the lectures and was able to finish all four weeks worth of work in two days! Thank you so much!,5
100912,Great intro to project management. Easy to follow and good examples,5
100913,A very easy course covering the basis of the Project Planning. It was a nice introduction to the subject.,4
100914,"This course is very informative, and helpful especially to those who will be managing projects without formal education about project management. The lecturer delivers each topic clearly and provides insights about managing projects.",5
100915,it's a well informed course manual that explains the basics of project management on a level that is very easy to understand.,5

100919,"Great course! I've gained a very strong basic level of project management and I hope to apply this new skill in my future work. Thanks to the Prof. Yael Grushka-Cockayne for her easily understandable lectures, time and effort.",5
100920,"I did learn the basics, but will need to go on and learn more in depth. I'd also like to have more written materials to go with the videos. I know I can download the video transcript, but what I'd like is actual handouts that are organized. I am more of a written/visual learner and need to read to retain information.",3
100921,This is helpful course for those who love to do project.,4
100922,Such a great course..,5
100923,Kindly include a provision to submit assignments on project management,4
100924,"Great review of the ""skillset"" necessary to become interested and far more involved into business as a PM. Great work from the instructor!Congrats to you.",4
100925,This course gives more expectation what I expected. It dips in a bit deeper than many other online project management course.,5
100926,Really useful content and materials! I loved being part of the course.,5
100927,An overall excellent course. 4-stars are attributed purely because of the limitations of when a quiz can be re-sat (twice in 7 days). This elongated the duration of the course.The material learnt within the course has been immediately applicable in my job - with success.,4
100928,Wonderful course for those who desire an overview of project management.,5
100929,Great course even for a seasoned Project Manager. It was a nice reminder of old concepts. I also got to learn more about new ones. Looking forward to more Coursera courses,4
100930,Great teacher. The slides could be more detailled but they are generally clear and well structured.,5

100935,Excellent course for the beginners.,4
100936,"So useful for Project Manager, you should take this course and learn asap.",5
100937,"This course has exceeded my expectations. Prof Grushka-Cockayne does a phenomenal job in explaining the fundamentals of Project Planning and Management in a manner that makes it easy to follow and understand. With numerous examples along the way, she succeeds in reaching out to various levels of knowledge prior to taking this course. The usage of popular software tools within this framework is very helpful and helps to illustrate the technicalities that come along with planning and managing a project. Furthermore, this course gave me the confidence in actively participating in bigger future projects, working together with people with a more in-depth knowledge of project planning. Prof Grushka-Cockayne's effort in making this topic accessible to a bigger audience outside of university classrooms is greatly appreciated and I am grateful for the time and perfectionism she invested in creating this course. Courses like this enable people all over the world with limited access to academic institutions to further pursue knowledge acquisition even post graduation. Thank you.",5
100938,This is a good fundamental course for the engineers like me who did not have any experience in the project management. I wish the course could include more examples to help us to understand better. Many thanks!,4
100939,"i like how the course covers metrics to track project tracking and how lecturer walks you over how to do plan projects in MS project. I feel like i can plan my projects better with the knowledge I've gained to create WBS. However, I do feel that at times the professor superficially covered subjects that i'd like her to delve more into. For example, dealing with complexities and ambiguity as a form of risk. The least she could have done is supplemented a useful article. She also doesn't talk about PERT, but implies it in her risk variance lecture (e.g., in her Tornado Chart). I also noticed that she condenses the 5 PMBOK phases into 4 by amalgamating Monitoring and Control with Execution.",4
100940,I enjoyed the course very much. So precise and practical.,5
100941,Great course. It pushed me to really focus on understanding and analyzing every aspect of project planning and management process.,5

100962,Love the use of practical examples.,5
100963,"This is my first course completed on Coursera web. I must say that it gave me a lot of very interesting information, the assessments were not easy to pass, videos were prepared very carefully (subtitles is a perfect idea!!) and - finalizing the course by own project is nice way to implement the knowledge into the practice",5
100964,"Excellent, clear, with a lot of examples and very visual",5
100965,Very well structured course. Great and handy tutorials. Thank you,5

100974,Very informative and easy understandable for a newbie in Project Management like me.,5
100975,"I didn't pay for the certificate, and I just watched the videos and took the quizzes without certification. I wanted to get exposure to project management. The class was well taught, gave a lot of information in short video segments. Great outside examples to illustrate the concepts covered. Great value and awesome for the Darden to provide this class (especially since it was free!).",5
100976,"perfectly done, very well explained and 100% professional taught.",5
100977,I am just at the Beginning but the course seems so well done and engaging.,4
100978,"Very good introduction to project management, gives indeed the fundamentals!",5
100979,Coursera helps me in developing major skills and knowledge about the project planning and management because of the lectures given by the worlds finest teachers and latest technology,5
100980,"Not aligned to PMI. Should be ideally directed towards helping prepare for recognized certifications like PMP, Prince2 etc.",1
100981,The lessons were very short but full of interesting and relevant information.,5
100982,Very introduction to project planning and risk management,5
100983,"The course is very well designed and the instructor is very clear and engaging! Moreover, a lot of useful tools and techniques are shown during sessions. Case studies could be improved, starting from the quality of videos and contents.",4

100992,"I like the course but I have a problem:Within the task and figure that I passed but within the ""Tasks "" section no. And I passed the rest of the work and I still do not get the course certificate. What should I do?A lot of peoble have the same problem.",4
100993,A bit short and shallow. Focus is definitely on project planning and not so much on project management.,3
100994,"very useful course that anyone needs ,not only for career , but also for life experince.",5
100995,This was a great course and very informative at that. I have been working on projects for years and have had my own inklings about how to execute projects alongside a few tools I had developed along the way but this course had the same tools and a few more I hadn't thought of before so I can greatly appreciate it.,5
100996,This class was a good overview of the topic of project management with an entertaining and well spoken teacher. This videos and content were engaging but not over whelming.,4
100997,This is the best online course. I want to pursue my Masters in Construction Management and this course has helped me to get an idea of how its to manage stuffs around the globe. I would like to thank Coursera for such a beautiful course. Its worth spending time for this course. Just go for it.,5

100999,Embraced key PM concepts in easy to understand form.,5
101000,Great course!,5
101001,"I love the way the class was organized from initiation to project execution and closing. I think the class would be better if the reason behind the correct quiz answers was given, for me this help me understand how to reason and be in the proper mindset when choosing and answer. Overall, great class and tea",5
101002,Very good intro to project management.,5
101003,The course provided a bunch of meaningful insights. Many techniques to approach project management were presented. I feel much more prepared to handle a project now. Excellent content!,5
101004,This is a good introductory course to Project Management.,4
101005,"Fantastic course, with great videos and materials. Yael is great at communicating the fundamentals via her videos, supplemental materials & case studies (really good examples of theory in practice).Great for anyone wanting to refresh/solidify their fundamentals in Project Management (for those already with work experience), as well as beginners who are interested in getting a solid foundation. I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in understanding the Fundamentals of Project Management.",5
101006,It's a great opportunity to learn something new. The professor is EXCELLENT. I am grateful because all the units are too interesting and it will be useful for the advanced diploma I'm going to start on february.Thank you so much.,5
101007,I found its contents to be very useful for my business.,4
101008,"The course has important insights about the Planning a Project. I really liked it and it was not time consuming, you can do it easily with your daily routine. Really good!",5
101009,"This course shares a lot of valuable information but could use a good deal of refinement. I really would have liked to have seen downloadable PDFs with the diagrams representing different models so that I could easily go back and reference them without having to find the particular moment in a video where it was shown. I also wish the videos were designed with better instructional strategies--the best Coursera courses (like those from Northwestern's Kellog School of Management) introduce material, expand on it, and then summarize the most important parts in each video--this helps the learner Here the learner is on their own. There's a lot of great information to pick up on, but some retooling from the UVA Darden School of Business would be greatly appreciated improvement.",3
101010,good content and focused presentation,5
101011,This 4 week course helped prepare me for taking the CAPM test. Many of the topics covered were in the exam. I found the overall course extremely beneficial. I highly recommend this course and instructor.,5
101012,This is a really good course to learn the basics in project management. It was a very successful 1st step for me. I am looking forward to do more courses in PM. Thank you prof for making the course interesting. :),5

101014,Great course - really interesting and a great introduction to project management. :),4
101015,"It is not fine that the courses close like every 3 months, I do this project with my school and we have just 1 hour a week so I have to change every time my courses wich I do not like. I only like this course",5

101023,"Great course! For a know-nothing person like myself, this course has given me an opportunity to understand one of the most interesting and detailed-oriented subjects to learn. Definitely recommend!",4
101024,"Engaging and informative. Time well spent! I recommend this course without hesitation to all those who wish to get into project management or who, like me, have been project managers without a specific formal training. I knew several project management tools from university (network planning, for instance) and this course was my chance to revise them, adding many intersting concepts on top. The teaching style is great. If you take the time to go back and watch the lectures more than once you'll find interesting information that you might have missed the first time and that will add much to your appreciation of the topic. In one word: great! I wish there were an advanced PM course by Yael Grushka-Cockayne. Her way to describe topics is really clear!",5
101025,I rate it 4.5 stars,4
101026,"Very engaging teacher, smart subject matter, well done",4
101027,Excellent coaching by professor Yael Grushka Cockayne. Its explained in simple language that any one can easily understand. I happy with the way course moves and enjoying studying in my leisure time.Ashokkumar S,4
101028,"The speaker was very difficult to follow with dialogue flow, random pauses, and stumbling over words. The rate of the speaker's speech was also very fast. The material was very useful, and informative otherwise.",3
101029,I´ve already sent my feedback.,5
101030,"It is a very good and intensive course of project management. Some pieces of information have been provided little bit balled, which made me make mistakes in quizzes. However I enjoyed all the stuff. Thanks a lot!",4
101031,Exceptional course with the content being simple and effective.,4
101032,Great entry to project management - it's only downside is that it's too short.,5
101033,Wonderful and very insightful.,5
101034,Course content is so nice,5
101035,Great course to learn how to have the basics on the subject. Simple explanations for complex concepts. Excellent rapporteur.,5

101037,It is excellent!!,5
101038,i am learning a lot,5
101039,This course is really great! Easy to understand and really useful. I believe I will be more efficient for my future project plans if I can successfully complete the whole course... Thank you :),5
101040,"Exams are not very good - some ambiguous, misleading or wrong-data questions/answers.",3
101041,"This was my first online course and I like it a lot. The course was well structured, well taught and covered relevant aspects of project planning and project management. It made me think about things I or our company is not doing (I'm not a project manager but impacted by it). And it gave me some tools to improve on individual and on company level. Everything was very practical and insightful. The cases helped as well and I liked the YouTube material. If there were topics that I would like to have had more information, then on Agile Project Management, as this becomes more and more important in my industry. And then it would have been helpful to get more insights on how to estimate time and especially budgets, knowing that this course is not about financial or ressource planning and understanding that these aspects vary from company to company and from project to project. Nevertheless it might have helped (me) but the course provided everything to figure it out anyway. Overall I can recommend this course for a solid base and inspiration in project planning and project management.",4
101042,Excellent course to gain knowledge about fundamental aspects of Project Planning and Management.,5
101043,"Gives maing idea about the actual project management, introduces basic tools to start with and teaches comprehensive approach to the projects",5
101044,"Great course!!!! The teacher was super clear, the concepts where really really awesome and well defined. The knowledge shared in this course is very practical, you can use the things your learned right away.",5
101045,Thanks Professor Yael!! Excellent course for project planning and management.,5
101046,A really good course. I especially like the practical supplementary lectures on MS Project and Excel. Would be better if the assessments took on more challenging formats than just multiple choice quizzes.,4
101047,Great course! I have refreshed the project management techniques studied years ago.,5
101048,"Great Teacher. Good examples, information delivered on the spot. Learned so much in this course! :)",5
101049,One of the best courses I ever taken on project management. Touches all the information you need as a PM so than you can expand the knowlege of those you need or use.,5

101057,VERY GOOD and PROFESSIONAL.I enjoyed every single lecture 😀,5
101058,Really it will help in my academic and career,5
101059,Very interesting and easy to follow.,4
101060,Pros:Basics were explained well.A good kick start for beginners who are travelling towards learning Project planning and management.Cons:Wish we had assignments to practice MS Project to a certain extent.Some of the Quiz questions were confusing (Esp. the 3rd week quiz),3
101061,Good for me,5
101062,Very informative. Easy to follow and understand. Useful and helpful to someone who is interested in finding out about project management.,5
101063,Good CourseNice material and the best is the professor explanation,5
101064,"A very good insight into the basics of Project planning, easily executable strategy and MSprojects intro was eye-opener. Tried on one small project and was able to feel the difference before the course came to an end. Thankyou very much. Some more information and detailing required in project execution(week 4).",4
101065,Good course for anyone like to learn management of projects and how to start it,4
101066,Impressive! My first course here!,5
101067,"This was a wonderful course! Prior to taking it, I had no idea how much project planning and management entailed. Additionally, I wasn't aware of the plethora of programs currently on the market that helps one facilitate the process of planning and managing a project. I found this course very insightful! Thank you!",5
101068,"Thanks! a great teacher, very clear!",5
101069,Very well organized. 5 stars to both the teacher and the subjects,5

101071,Great course about management！,5
101072,"Mine the only recommendation is to completely remake voice over for this course. To make it like here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=93&v=XCG4ppNZYsI - this voice over is perfect (soft, natural, not loud, not sharp, speech rate is slow enough). And thank you! )",5
101073,I thought the instructor paced herself well and was very articulate. I would recommend this course.,5
101074,Very informative course with Excellent teacher. The course includes essential material for project planning and management which is taught with clarity.,5

101079,Great first aproach to Project Managment !!!,5
101080,"Interesting and important course, so useful and rich in info.Thank you,",4
101081,This course was a very valuable introduction to project planning & management and the terminology and techniques used. It also provided a good amount of information and was not dragged out over a long period of time.,5
101082,"A great teacher inspires. And this is what I see here. I have fallen in love with this subject. The expression, way of speech of the Professor are amazing. Lectures proceed followed by an example that clarifies the concept very clearly. It's so interestingly taught that one just loves each and every lecture. Thank you so much Prof. Yael Grushka-Cockayne, University of Virginia and Coursera. I hope to see more and more courses from this Professor :)",5
101083,"Quick and concise. Both a benefit and a boon. There are some concepts that would be awesome to have additional reading resources on. But, still a great course.",4
101084,An informative and well-run course. I has never really thought about project management in such a concrete and analytical way.,4
101085,Professor is superb! Her language and explanations are clear and vivid.,5
101086,Excellent overview. Engaging instructor. Highly recommend.,5
101087,"The course provides a case. We have to identify the problem. I appreciated the fact that how I define a problem decides on how I propose to address it. A different definition leads to altogether different steps! The course also provides a good template and sufficient guidelines to help us develop a strategy to address the problem we have defined. Finally , we have to think about how we can test if our strategy is viable. We are also guided to think about the changes that might be necessary in our organization in terms of structure, KPIs, skills etc. Given the nature of this capstone project one cannot expect it to be too specific and have a heavy application of analytics. What it does is provide you with a good idea of how to put all that you have learned in each of the specializations in a comprenesive manner, and that how these ideas fit together to create a big picture. If you are looking at complex number crunching excerices then you will not find it here. If you are looking for excerices that will make you think and think and think then you will be quite satisfied. I am!",5
101088,"Great Learning ! Helps reinforce understanding of core concepts,methodologies & approaches.",5
101089,Providing guidance to achieve project by own step by step by asking correct questions. It,5
101090,A well structured and practical work oriented project.,5
101091,"This course was great, I learn a lot about the tech industry and it was very interesting.",5
101092,The Business Analytics Capstone provided you the opportunity to apply the learning from all the previous courses from Business Analytics in a very practical way to solve a case. This is very reflective of a real world problem.,5
101093,Topic was good and up-to-date,4
101094,"I enjoyed the other courses in this specialization, but the capstone was disappointing. The course was not very structured and did not draw from the other courses in a substantial way. It was often difficult to see how the readings related to the projects. The course could use a lot more curation and direction.",1
101095,good course,5
101096,Interesting course. Wish there is more hands-on.,4
101097,Great course for getting the overview as well as understanding various aspects of business analytic.,5
101098,I took this together with 4 other modules in the Business Analytics Specialisation. I like the case study in which I am able to apply what I learn to real world issues.,5
101099,Great Capstone to showcase the knowledge and skills acquired through the Specialization!,5
101100,Very interesting and thoughtful stuff!,4
101101,"Great experience, esp. the peer review.",4
101102,Good tool kits are shared & insights given in 4 major areas of business. Great!,5
101103,The whole course is nice and there were lot of new things to learn. I am not from an IT background but still found it very useful. However the capstone was a bit of disappointment. I believe they should have included some teaching authority to check the Capstone projects for my better understanding. The whole capstone is reviewed by peers which is great but as per certification I believe there should be some professional help too. I even tried to speak to someone over the phone but there was no number available. I ended up with chatting with some one on the help center but that was not very helpful either. The course content for operation analytics and People Analytics were indeed very useful. Thanks.,1
101104,Pretty good :),4
101105,Interesting and useful:),5
101106,very smart,5
101107,Great course! Very well structured and easy to follow. Videos always went into the subject matter in depth and explained the core concepts.,5
101108,"As others have said, the first four courses were good - I learned a lot from the videos and materials. However, the capstone project was a waste of time. Why a company failing in its industry was chosen as the focus is beyond me. In addition, the concepts learned in the previous four courses were only about 1/3 of the requirements of this capstone project - the problem statement and strategy portions could have been done without having taken the four previous courses at all. This seemed like a very generic project with almost no collaboration between the professors who taught the previous four courses. I expected a lot more from a Wharton-led course - very disappointing.",1
101109,The preceding courses were interesting and helpful. This capstone project lacked substance. The project did not allow itself to apply many of the concepts learned throughout the course. It's almost exclusively about customer analytics. I would not be surprised if Yahoo! worked with Wharton and Coursera to launch this course in order to crowd-source ideas on how to turn around the company.,1
101110,good closing course but peer reviewing and no prof is little untraditional.,3
101111,"This course was terribly underwhelming. There is no interaction from the Wharton staff, nothing that connects this to anything learned in the specialization, and nothing that even resembles a case study. Grades are subjectively assigned on a very narrow grading scale by peers and the format of the assignment doesn't allow for enough explanation to develop a thesis. of Any information given to the student is from magazine/newspaper/journal articles without data and we are tasked with identifying a business solution to a problem with little context. Very disappointed in this offering. After taking the Data Analysis specialization offered through Duke University I know what a capstone course should be and this course is so far from that it should be removed from the course catalog.",1
101112,Wonderful experience doing this course.,5
101113,I loved it.,5
101114,"The Capstone project was on a very interesting topic, however it did not really allow much utilisation of knowledge from the course and was lacking in it's relevance to the application of data analytics. If this area of the project is addressed, it would deserve the five stars.",4
101115,Capstone provided a very good platform to use all the knowledge gained in the specialization courses...,5
101116,"Good to be able to apply the lessons from the individual courses in one, single project, but I missed having actual teachers to review my work as well",3
101117,"I was disappointed by the Capstone. I expected we would get some data set we would use to apply the analytics skills we learned. Instead we got an ""open-ended"" problem description with few if any input on Yahoo's operations. The only data available was public data (e.g. annual report, executive interviews, etc.).",2
101118,A great experience of applying what this specialization taught me so far.,5
101119,Provided nothing of value or relevance to the previous courses. Additionally there was essentially no input from Wharton instructors.,1
101120,"Even do the Research subject was very interesting, this capstone was a total disappointment.The Capstone did not offer very much support and the final review was performed for peers without previous knowledge and experience, receiving peer's complaints due to the fact that many got bad grading.Also, many peers complaint about the image of the Specialization Certificate for not being designed professionally and many felt that they petitions where overlook.",3
101121,It improves my systematic approach toward solving problems,5
101122,Greats courses,5
101123,"From my perspective, the individual courses that made up the ""Capstone"" (people, customer, accounting, and operations analytics) were both educative and interactive. These individual courses contained data focused problems and gave a general overview of the specific field.However, the final ""Capstone"" project was entirely disappointing and something I even plan to complain to Coursera about. After having a two month delay, the course not only lacked any direction, but seemed to be put together last minute without any real thought or plan. The entire ""Capstone"" was driven by hypotheticals, almost all of which did not have any relevance to the past four courses. An educated individual could easily complete this ""Capstone"", without any knowledge whatsoever from the previous four courses. The ""Capstone"" provided a few articles and videos related to the issue (Yahoo Ad Blocker) to help us solve the problem, but clearly the course heavily lacked content. I was expecting the course to contain hypothetical data for us to interact with and predict how the Ad blocker problem and our proposed solutions would drive the data of Yahoo's business. However, the course merely was driven by complete hypotheticals that only required one to be educated about general business functions. This ""Capstone"" hardly related to the previous four courses, and it is a scam that this course cost $99.",1
101124,"the capstone project had peer reviews, requesting you to consider executive feedback, otherwise i am not able to actually judge the quality of my work",3
101125,"If data could be shared, it would make the capstones project more practical.",4
101126,"Very nice and interesting subject. Updated information materials. Peer reviewing is not sufficient for grading a Capstone Project. A raw case + hands-on quizzes would help frame/evaluate the capstone project, instead of having a dedicated Wharton personnel to grade presentations.",3
101127,The peer review is not a good idea for this course. I expected to have valuable inputs from Wharton staff to my submission.,3
101128,I think that to reviewed by classmates is nbot the best way to get an education. Anyway - thank you,4
101129,Very hand-on. It let you think on your own and apply concepts previously studied. The review process may be improved.,5
101130,"Very challenging, yet more interesting. I like these capstones, learned way more than I expected. Great course, recommend strongly.",5
101131,Nice MOOC. Nice Last course. AR Track is very nice.,4
101132,"This is it! This was the last course in the Robotics Specialization. I must say this was the most interesting course in this specialization, there are 2 tracks available to choose from: a software one and a hardware one. Needless to say I chose the latter. I think pretty much anyone doing a robotics specialization should opt for this one if they have the means. It is nice to simulate different scenarios and learn different concepts through them, however, nothing beats the joy of building something by yourself and witnessing the fruits of your hard work, it is really rewarding!My main and only complaint about this course is related to the grading system for the hardware track. It relies on a system of peer reviews by 3 other students. Sometimes the results might not be fair, and you will need to resubmit your work because of that.",4
101133,This course has two great projects .A simulated MIP track and a Physical lab track in which we will make a Rover.If you are ambitious you can even implement slam on the AR track.AR track is on raspberry pie and the simulation track is on matlab.This course will give you the basics for a robotics career I believe.,5
101134,Worthy every effort put into the capstone project. This gives a practical example of almost every concepts we studied in the specialization,5
101135,"The capstone is really good.Too bad it means the end of this specialization... I liked it here.But it is also the beginning of playing more with ROS, simulation tools and real robots.",5
101136,AR track is interesting.Student should be advised to get the robot earlier before course starts.It would also be nice to get some introduction to ROS...,5
101137,The best!!!!,5
101138,Amazing organization of the course which I found very fruitful and highly ela,5
101139,great for A level Classical studies,5
101140,These are very succinct strategies for your startup!,5
101141,A very nice course for any aspiring entrepreneur.,5
101142,Great class what you learn in here as a huge value,5
101143,Absolutely fantastic. I was shown many standpoints I have never considered and introduced to useful tips that have given me courage to make the first moves in my venture.,5
101144,"Amazing course, but contents related to expansion can be improved.",4
101145,High level but useful basics.,4
101146,Very good overview to get you thinking strategically prior to launching your startup.,5
101147,Awesome Basics Explained.,5
101148,"As a newbie, I really found enough information here to recognize that my venture is worth pursuing. I am going to finish the rest of the course and get ready to find my partners.",5
101149,"Excellent, in line with the daily activities of any entrepreneur.",5
101150,Great info. Thank you!,5
101151,Excellent course and really helped me ensure that I can kick start the right way in the near future.,5
101152,This course is a natural linear progression from Entrepreneurship 1.,5
101153,"The course is good and very informative. However, the quiz at the end can be made a bit more interactive and opinionated.",4
101154,It is OK but too broad to get actionable learnings,3
101155,Right Mix for the Startup,5
101156,Insightful and practical ideas. Examples and additional material were very good.,5
101157,Need more challenging exams.,5
101158,Interesting,5
101159,Higly informative. Plan to go further into the specialization by taking the third course,5
101160,great course,5
101161,Excellent! Thank you very much for the learning.,5
101162,Allot of relevant and useful information presented to support planning the launch of a start up that will save founders time,5
101163,Excellent course. Lots of practical case studies making the learning more interesting. I'd like to thank Coursera for facilitating this and more importantly the Course instructors from Penn university who I believe done a remarkable job.,5
101164,Great!,5
101165,Very well articulated and to the point. Thank you!,4
101166,Short and Solid,4
101167,"Great course, Very educating and highly innovative",5
101168,Learned a lot. Thank you very much.,5
101169,Absolutely Fantastic Program. Professors are the best!!,5
101170,"Useful. I feel some areas such as strategy, getting to MVP etc could benefit from more case studies and materials to work through. The overall content of the lectures is good but to internalise it there needs to be more 'work' for the students to engage in rather than just a quiz at the end.",3
101171,"The material taught in this course is great. It focuses on how to launch your idea using the lean start up, business model, etc. If you have been reading some books, you will find some of the things mentioned to be familiar. You will also learn how to build your team, and navigate through difficult conversation, such as equity division. You will learn on what to look for in hiring key management, and professional services.Unfortunately, some of the points mentioned may not be relevant to countries outside USA.",4
101172,great introduction to business management!,5
101173,Kudos to professors for the great job done.,5
101174,outstanding effort by wharton,5
101175,Very informational!,5
101176,Great and Excellent thoughts and course material.,5
101177,"Starts off slow, but it soon becomes quite interesting and informative. Some parts were quite vague though so don't expect anything too in depth.",4
101178,Very good and informative and I like the fact that there are a lot of examples.,5
101179,The course provides very concise and useful information,5
101180,I really enjoyed this course. There were ideas that really helped me defined my idea. I love the presentation. I would suggest breaking some of the longer modules into smaller parts. Add another Quiz on the third and 4th lesson. I do love this specialization. I am going to keep going.,4
101181,"Tons of value -- for free!!I hope in future iterations of this course you could include more tangible tools we can use to help grow our business. These lectures included a few resources -- but more could definitely be introduced.As a business owner myself, this course has shed some light on things I hadn't considered -- and offered a more academic approach to business. I hope in the future more ""resources"" could be included -- because I think many people considering starting their own business but don't realize how many excellent resources are available (and many times for free -- just take Coursera, for example!!)",5
101182,Very interesting basic info about entrepreneurship,5
101183,This course covered every detail that a startup entrepreneur must take into account when launching an enterprise: from the naming of the brand and the pitch approach to the legal aspects in intellectual property. I have found interesting and important information that will surely help me save time in future planning.,5
101184,great course thnks,5
101185,THANK YOU!,5
101186,Course very well done!Would be of a greater value adding a lecture on what are the differences among legal corporations and which form is preferred by VC.,4
101187,"It is a great course with great, new insights. The teachers are very passionate about this topic. They are sharing their own experiences with start-ups which makes this course so unique and special. This specialization is the best serious of courses I ever did!",5
101188,Great course for anyone who is thinking about launching a business.Highly recommend it!,5
101189,This program plays an important role to my start up's knowledge. Thank all professors for it,4
101190,Nice course on details of different issues to be addressed while launching startup,4
101191,Exceptional and Must-Have course for budding entrepreneurs.Highly Recommended,5
101192,I know it will be awesome :),5
101193,THIS Professor needs more than just his own Coursera module. He needs his own television show! & it stuck! the information stuck. I took this class over a year ago and can still recall the case histories.,5
101194,This is not only course for me. I will keep my notes whole my private business life. Everytime you fall to concern there you will find the answer for the growth.,5
101195,Very good course.,4
101196,This is the best grounding one can get to growing a business,5
101197,a lot to learn,5
101198,"I wanna thank here Prof Ed Hess for his inspiring personality and experience.

101207,"A very useful course, especially when you are active in a 2-year old start-up like me. It gave me great insight because I could relate it all back to the position I'm in myself. Thank you very much for making this course possible. I'll start directly with part 2 now!",5
101208,"it's a useful course. Teaches me many concept about how to start a business, how to prepare your mind before start a course. I'll keep learning. Thx professor.",5
101209,"One of the best courses on Coursera that I've taken. Professor Ed purposefully addresses MOOC students and know who to motivate in front of the camera. Small talks of personal life (I think students get to know his wife's and daughter's names!) and the camera man (also all the crew showing up at the last lecture) make this MOOC EXTREMELY real!Besides the great pedagogical approach, each week there is a real case and a Skype interview with a business leader/ entrepreneur whose case is under exploration. This further adds authenticity to the course! Week one content's, for me is the best; while the other weeks are also great. Lots of metaphors (outrun the bear, gas pedal, worry plate...) as well. In short, the content is way beyond expectation. Highly recommend for those who run a private business!#fullofenergy #exemplaryMOOC #thankyou #Ed #coursera",5
101210,Great course! I've got really valuable knowledge!,5
101211,I really enjoy this course since the learning materials mostly came from real life cases and it offer many insights regarding growth for private businesses,4
101212,"Passionate professor, useful and practical tips make this course excellent.Thank you, professor Edward!Caiqiu",5
101213,"I didn't like the professor's teaching style. He took way more time than was necessary to get his points across. Plus the little quips where he's pretending to engage with the viewer made it feel like a kids show. There were some good nuggets of info, but there was too much filler to get to it.",2
101214,Great course. I've learned a lot. And also good to understand to foreigners. :D,5
101215,The professor Ed Hess seems to be a great guy and really know what he's talking about. I'm going to make the part ii of the course for sure.,5
101216,Great course. The professor is brilliant and keeps you thinking.,5

101227,A very informative and beneficial course. Easy to understand. thank you.,5
101228,"I really like the teacher and the course content. I feel very engaged in the video lectures and feel disappointed when one ends to quickly. Definitely an eye opener, with strategies that I can employ right away.Thank you.",5
101229,"The teacher has a very engaging style (I am actually sad to see that there are no newer courses than these two by Ed in the UVirginia catalogue), even though his choice to base everything on cases, although providing interesting material, dilutes the takeaways in his lessons.The teachings of this course are interesting and extremely useful for everybody analysing his or her own business assessing if it meets the requirements for growth and the direction in which it should grow.",4
101230,"Great Prof. Great Course. Learned a lot with the most efficient way. Made me good to think over my business, my goals, my opportunities. Thank you a lot!",4

101292,When I was in a physical classroom I wish I had a Professor like Ed. He was motivating from the very start when I sampled the course and he is the reason why I enrolled and ultimately why I completed the course and applied for the certificate. I learned a lot that I can apply to my business. Thanks Ed see you in Part 2!,5
101293,"A very good course, I learn a lot with it",5
101294,This helped me a lot on thinking about growing my business,5
101295,"Made the class exciting, and helped make the possibility of being something bigger not only seem possible, but gave a new way of actually doing that. I recommend this class even if you're convinced you can do it with the things you currently know. You'll learn something.",5
101296,Really great course!,5
101297,Excellent class taught by highly engaged professor. Good for someone with a few years of business experience or mid-level management. Would be less valuable for someone fresh out of school of just starting to climb the corporate ladder.,5
101298,"Im not finished yet, but its really nice one. Much place to play with data and optimization beyond actual course requirements. Lot of freedom in implementation wich is great. Ive already learned a lot and planning to spend time playnig with Observatory project further just for fun and experience. Thank you so much for this opportunity! :)",5
101299,"The topic of capstone is great, but the milestones, and their APIs direct towards bad solutions.",3
101300,"Phenominal course! Well organized, good pace, great combination of ""practical theory"" with examples that illustrate the concepts. and very clear well-thought out explanations by Dr. Miller. Best Spark class I've seen, and best class in this series (sorry, Dr. Odersky).",5
101301,Incredibly well put together. The capstone project is a great exercise in assimilating all the knowledge from the other related courses in function programming package. I like that I had to learn about interesting algorithms like the Mercator projection and inverse-distance weighting.,5
101302,Good project but instruction is a bit draft. Probably because I joined their first ever one.,3
101303,Thank you. The course is really nice.,5
101304,Good project enjoyed playing with the Scala.ja,4
101305,"A bit sad that actual full working solution is not graded as it invovled generating files on disk, which is compuation intensive...",4
101306,A lot of fun and a working project at the end with which to experiment with various parallelism strategies.,5
101307,"For a course that requires you to work on your own project, it still forces you to follow a code skeleton outline. This limits the freedom with which to tackle the project's issue. There is not much guidance or support from course organizers, which makes this course not very educative.",2
101308,Thank you! Learned a lot!,5
101309,"this course is very basic, provides a lot of information that's not really practical or useful. i suppose someone who's seeing internet for the first time would find it informative, but not very engaging. as for the majority of those who use coursera to self-educate it would probably seem a bit too much of stating the obvious. also I'd like to mention the delivery of the information - its a text that's read aloud. nothing more - well, thanks for that. I can read faster than I can listen to a video. if you're making a video - make it worth actually WATCHING.",1
101310,Overly theoretical in my opinion.,4
101311,The material is very simple to follow. I hope to get more hands-on practice in using the concepts introduced so that I can more easily relate them to everyday life but also further internalize and understand them.,4
101312,"Videos and PDF notes are excellent - brief, direct, to the point. Current and good use of timing. Good quiz questions that test your understanding. Really enjoying this course compared to others attempted. would definitely recommend. thank you",5
101313,On point with excellent examples.,5
101314,Very well done and easy to understand.,5
101315,"This is an amazing course modelled to know the nuances of quantitative modelling. I would request the course moderators to include excel sheets with the given models done. Especially it would be helpful for me if you were given how to make practical use of logistic regression in cases like buy or not buy a share, take or not take a subscription sort of examples. Thank you.",5
101316,Great!,5
101317,"Too fundamental, too easy. No depth in math",3
101318,"Good level of detail and math for application use, though not for theoretical analysis.",4
101319,It was great to learn how to use mathematical functions in real life business problems! I am glad I had to take this course in one of the top international business schools!,5
101320,"This was a very informative course. I personally would have liked the course to be a bit more intensive on the math side, but I can understand that the entire target audience may not necessarily feel the same. I think that the course could have gone in depth for other kind of models such a monte carlo, markov chains, probability trees as well. Apart from that the course was quite good.",4
101321,A great refresher. Very practical examples and knowledge. Great fundamentals course.,5
101322,"Excelent course for those looking for a complete introduction to mathematical functions, statistics and how they relate to modeling in various scenarios.",5
101323,The course is really comprehensive yet very simple to understand. I like how he explains every lessons with examples on how to use this functions and formulas in modeling. Hope to finish this whole specialization courses to further understand financial modeling! :),5
101324,"Excellent Course, although, quizzes must be explained better in each question.",5
101325,Very helpful course. Course material properly structured which really helped in understanding the concepts.,5
101326,"The concepts are really well explained and the video lectures are engaging (not boring). The tone of the professor is appropriate and I really appreciated his way to explain economics modeling.I already knew part of the topics and treat them in my university career, but it was helpful to give my memory a little boost and explore them in a different way that I'm used to.The difficulty is less than average; I would say that is appropriate for an undergraduate course and proportional for the effort required (2-3 hours par week).",5
101327,"As a guy from Machine Learning field, its models and concepts are so easy and simple for me, so it's lack of challenge.",3
101328,Fantastic course. Was very tough to pass but excellent learning,5
101329,"The student needed to have a good foundation of statistics and high levels of math to be able to follow the class. I have not taken statistics or trigonometry in many years so I struggled. I would have benefited greatly if there were more examples of how to calculate the models, including the calculations part of it. The professor did not do that and that got me wondering (not knowing) how to calculate the formulas. I think if I had seen a few examples, it would have been enough to understand and keep up.So, more step-by-step instructions on the mechanics of formulas, would be my biggest recommendation.But the professor did a superb job explaining the concepts, and showcasing some industry applications of the models.Thank you for asking.",2
101330,Easy to understand and provide good theories,5
101331,"Its good for the starters but touches very few and very basic concepts. No offense, but the professor could have made it much more interaction by making the better slights he would just read values without even using markers",2
101332,Great,4
101333,Great course for the Business Maths and Statistics Students.,4
101334,this is an amazing course.,5
101335,Course is helpful as a refresher to econ and business students who took some statistics in college. Someone who has never taken such courses will probably find this course much less helpful.,3
101336,"This is a quick run-through different types of distributions. I found it useful as a recap of things I learned in high school (!) and there were some additional insights. However, I think this course might be hard if you never did any more advanced (high school) math.",3
101337,I was expecting the course to provide insight on how to use spread sheet and its respective formulae in mathematical modelling.,3
101338,Well explained concepts,5
101339,"Great way to introduce someone like me, with no business/mathemarical education, to the basic concepts of modelling.",5
101340,"Good overview. However, much of this information was even more basic than I had anticipated.",4
101341,wonderful introduction !!!!excellent!!!!,5
101342,"While a student, I couldn't understand any of these, the probabilistic, deterministic models, their types, differences and applications. I would usually memorize when to use them just to pass the course. Now, this time I feel I really comprehend them. And it happened smooth and quite easily because the instructor was amazing. The material was well presented and gradually getting more advanced. U would highly recommend the course! Thank you.",5
101343,"This course helped me to understand, the main concepts about modeling with log, linear power and exponentials functions with very interesting examples of the real life, highly recommended.",5
101344,"The information in the course seems appropriate for an introductory level class and is presented clearly and in an understandable manner; the theoretical portion of the course is solid.Having said that, the course could do with more exercises and practice tests in which you can apply and understand the formulas, how they are used, and why. The arithmetic component of the course felt glossed over and while that was not the focus of the course a few extra exercises could make things clearer and would not be a burden.Fundamental knowledge of probability/statistics will help you better understand some of the concepts in the course, so if you have the time you could try checking those subjects before, or even while, studying this course.Didactically, looking at the instructor's face for long periods of time gets tedious after a while, but this is just a minor issue.",4
101345,Excellent course! Basic introduction of modeling that is very easy to accept as well as get hang of.,5
101346,"Great course and instructor, related the models with day to day scenarios very well.",5
101347,A very good introduction about the different models.The only negative point is that it might be sometimes too theoretical.,4
101348,Have certain degree of difficulty.,4
101349,"It was an interesting module, however, not sure how I will apply this in",3
101350,There should be lab or hands one calculation exercise.,3
101351,Nice course to modeling!,5
101352,Good intro in the topics.,4
101353,It was theoretical but provided an apt understanding.,3
101354,"Personally, did not like the pace of the course. The course can be a bit more interesting with real-life case studies.",2
101355,Very helpful guide to modelling. I highly recommend to all who are interested in modelling reality to its nearest precision to start from here.,5
101356,A great overview. Thank you.,5
101357,"Very good and useful introduction. Logistic regression could have been expanded a little more, so that we can start using it.",5
101358,"it's really good subject , it helps me to have a plus of knowledge",4
101359,So clear and interesting !,5
101360,Very Interesting subject. Modules were very planned and sliced.,5

101366,Excellent beginner material providing you basic concepts of quantitive modelling which provides the base to modelling of real world projects.,5
101367,Just the basics. No concrete explanations of models. You have to study them on your own.,2
101368,It's simple but could be a way to refresh my memory.,4
101369,"This course helped me really to understand the concepts behind mathematical formulas commonly used in business analytics. I much more clearly understand the relation between variables within a function, as well as their meaning in reality. Overall, I can tell this course is great as the introduction for the Business and Financial Modeling Specialization. Very pleased with the quality and intelligence of the instructor.",5

101378,great course,4
101379,Great course which will help you do your mathematical finance courses.,5
101380,Material covered was very well chosen. The Professor's lectures were easy to grasp. Quiz questions were just tricky enough for one to slip up.,5
101381,"The is an excellent course. However, in the event someone takes the quiz and passes with only 1-3 questions incorrect, that the answers be displayed so that the student can rework the questions in their own time. Please note that the answers will only populate if the quiz is passed. That way those who fail will have to go back to their notes and review, without having the correct answers provided to them.",4
101382,I really like this course. Excellent professor.,5
101383,"In a word. Excellent!I have learnt a lot during this course.Even though there are no direct interactions during the videos, Professor Richard Waterman still manages to keep it very engaging including excellent dry wit.I found the course quite challenging seeing as I have very little background in Finance/Business modelling, although I have sufficient work experience to help me through.The modules content was explained with clarity.Thank You, Coursera, Thank You, Professor Richard Waterman!",5

101395,great learning experience,5
101396,"Great Course. However, It is a little too basic for me.I think It best fits for someone new.",4
101397,This course is useful.,5
101398,A first year undergraduate student can pass this,2
101399,This course has a great over view of these subjects. I the course as a refresher as well as additional insight into regression topics. I liked the course and I would advise this to somebody else as well.,4
101400,"Very useful, many intresting information",5
101401,Raised my confidence while dealing with basic stats & probability,5
101402,"This course provides an introduction to Fundamentals of Quantitative Modeling. It's also been a pleasure to master the course materials through lectures of professor Waterman, who made them easier to grasp. Thanks a lot!",5
101403,"This introductory course is perfect. It gives you time to think (you don't have to spend too much time in order to understand the material/concepts) and it is self-sufficient. I would suggest to set the playback rate at 1.25 since the teacher talks really slow. In addition, I would like to see the teacher talking like a human being instead of reading his notes in a black background but this is not super important for me. All in all, I totally recommend it!",5
101404,"most contents are explicit on ppt, it is sometimes not necessary to view the lectures.",3
101405,"I believe this was a very good course for beginners. However, from Wharton, I would have expected more realistic examples. I would have also liked some hands-on assignments. But, otherwise.. Great, great course from a beginners point-of-view! Thank you so much!",3
101406,The professor was clear and concise while teaching a mathematical course.,5
101407,Basic but informative,3
101408,Provides clarity of concepts,5

101420,Excellent course. interesting and every class so much clear.,5
101421,Love those examples,5
101422,too easy. not enough practical skills or tools teaching,3
101423,The instructor is exceptional at taking complex concepts and using examples to make them understandable. There is a lot of information so reviewing the videos within the different modules may be necessary. You will get a lot of good information and understand how to practically apply it. Very useful.,4
101424,Very fundamental course. Totally satisfy,5
101425,This was an outstanding review of quantitative modeling concepts. Very well worth the time to step through the coursework. I feel it reinforces concepts I need to apply in the healthcare data analysis field. Thank,5
101426,Great introduction to basics of quant modeling,5
101427,"A very very basic course , i will suggest using it as a refresher rather than anything else .It is however very easy to pass and get a certificate .",4
101428,amazing professor and examples that made a very difficult topic comprehensible,5
101429,"Very clear and presented step by step. I did take a little longer to go through everything, but it's just because I am very far away from my comfort zone.",5
101430,"The course is wonderful!!!!! And i have a good score, HAHA!",5
101431,Very interactive and it was fun completing the course. Learned a lot,5
101432,This is business and financial modeling. There were not enough examples of business related content. THis hindered my ability to comprehend function and modeling concepts as well as I would have liked.,4
101433,"Very informative and interesting course. The lecturer presents information clearly, information is structured, a lot of practical examples. All examples and formulas are clearly explained. I enjoyed this course!",5
101434,I love how the lectures are constructed. Even at the end of module 1 I feel so confident of doing well. Thank You.,4
101435,"Good course, gives a good fundamental overview of the material covered.",5
101436,An excellent course content delivered by an equally excellent instructor/professor,5
101437,Great Introductory Course!,5
101438,"I knew about modeling already, but this was a good refresher and it includes a minor business concepts.",4
101439,This is a good introductory course.,5
101440,Nice remember for statistical concepts :),5
101441,the lecturer is kind of boring,3
101442,nicely thought and concepts well explained.,5
101443,Clear and concise instruction. Useful examples and illustrations.,5
101444,Perfect course and perfect lecturer.,5
101445,Very well explained! Thank You very Much,5
101446,Felt a little rudimentary until the last week. I hope the specialization picks up after this point.,3
101447,Not overcomplicated and very informative. Enjo,5
101448,I love the content of this course,5
101449,"Professor Waterman did an Excellent job of explaining complex concepts in an easy to understand language. The use of examples, for almost all concepts, in the course was something I just enjoyed very much! Priceless!",5
101450,C,5
101451,Very clear explanation and easy to understand.,5
101452,The course content is remarkably well explained.,5
101453,"Its a very good course, the lecturers are very good and explain the concepts very well",5
101454,great practical learning.,5
101455,Very good introduction to modeling. Only improvement would be to show your correct/incorrect answers on the Quizzes to allow you to understand where you had missed a point.,5
101456,Excelent introduction to the basics. Gives you solid ground do keep improving. Totally recommend!,5
101457,Very nicely done - precise and superb. Thanks prof for good flow and examples. The quiz were also good and logical.,5
101458,"Helpful, Well organized, Make you curious about what's going on in later course.",5

101461,Great course,5
101462,the Knowledge is very organized and clear.,5
101463,The course was very helpful with gaining knowledge about various quantitative models.,5
101464,"Professor Waterman presented the material in a clear and concise manner. This course is a great refresher to basic quantitative methods, and does a great job introducing more complex methods as well. Following courses build directly upon this one, so I highly recommend!",5
101465,The professor was very clear in his content. Lots of interesting material at a digestible rate.,5
101466,Very good course so far.,5
101467,"The materials in this course were great, but some of the math was not properly explained enough for the individuals to be able to see how the formulas were derived - especially some of the basic calculus and the regression materials. I believe it would have only added 5-10 more minutes in one or two modules to do so since there were so few examples given (This could be covered in subsequent courses within the specialization - I am not sure yet as I will be taking course #2 in the specialization starting next week). Otherwise, this course was a great overview of the types of models used.",3
101468,The course was great! everything was explained in a clear and constructive manner,5
101469,"That's a great course. I'm from Brazil and really loving it, understanding what's being said without any problem.",5
101470,This course is a very good introduction and refresher of the essentials of quantitative analysis and helps to set the foundations for more advance related topics.,5
101471,REALLY INSIGHTFUL,5
101472,Great information!,5
101473,"I do not intend this to be mean, but I could not listen to Richard Waterman. I am British and I understand that Richard was born in the UK but spent a great many years in the US. If he had a BritiI really struggled to listen to him as his accent crosses the Atlantic several times a sentence. I found I couldn't listen to WHAT he was saying because I was so distracted by HOW he was saying it. I am sorry, there is probably nothing that he can do about it and the course looked very interesting but I simply could not bring myself to continue.",1
101474,Fabulous foundation course. Strikes a balance between assuming no previous knowledge and challenging the learner with some deeper concepts.,5
101475,Excellent course on math background for quantitative modelling,5
101476,"This is a good course for brushing up, or learning the basics of quantitative modeling.",5
101477,It is very easy and somehow less impacting on real business problem. I hope this Microdegree will get into some kind of complexity otherwise will remain high school level.,2
101478,"Nice primer for modeling, but wish there were more workable problems to help hit the point home.",3
101479,"Great course, Instructor was clear and concise when presenting data. Love the implementation of statistics into various modeling techniques.",5
101480,Perfect if you want to get your basics straight.,5
101481,"Great course that introduces all the various topics in modeling and gets you to started thinking about how to process information, in addition to giving you the tools and skills needed to succeed. Well worth the price.",5
101482,Very basic and the lectures are short in duration. Not what I expected from this course.,2
101483,I would have liked the quizzes to explain why an answer was right or wrong.,3
101484,very clear and well designed course. excellent teacher,5
101485,interesting grasp of foundations in modeling,4
101486,"The course is informative and does its job of introducing the approach to modeling pretty nicely. It could be made more rigorous by going in-depth about probabilistic models, particularly the Monte Carlo simulations and the Markov models.I would like to thank Prof. Richard Waterman and the Coursera team for making this course available. Prof. Waterman is precise and to the point. Those who find the video lectures to be slow paced (which includes me as well ) can watch it at 1.5-2X speed.",4
101487,"Could use a lot more practices & examples. Overall, it's great!",4
101488,Excellent content and instructor. Up your skill set with this course!,5
101489,great explenation,5
101490,"Very informational Course! As it slowly progresses from the easier and more basic concepts, the instructor has help us to build a strong foundation of the topic. Recommended for those who want to review statistics, maths and economics, and very look forward to the further courses!",5
101491,"Excellent course, very well organized and very detailed. Would recommend highly.",5
101492,Perfect！Learning all practical modeling skill from this course.,5
101493,"The lecture is clear, but it's a fundamental lesson which could not learn many things, just theories. Furthermore, I suggest that there should be solution hints for Quiz, because students will be frustrated by not knowing the answers and not knowing how to fix them. In addition, the discussion broad is a little bit cold and lack of mentors to help students.",3
101494,I am exactly looking for this course since 7-8 months recently i come across and immedietly registered .I am going through the concepts covered here. Nice and elaborative. Thank you Dr,4
101495,"Comprehensive, great lessons",5
101496,"Entry-level of Quantitative models development skills, good for a new comer like me.",4
101497,"Really superficial overview, I suppose it's good for just familiarizing oneself with assigning the appropriate model, but to shallow for any real carry over to the real world.",2
101498,Very insightful and challenging.,5
101499,"The instructor is very good at explaining a wide range of notions used in business modeling, statistics and probability theory. Would have liked to get a bit more in-depth insight into certain topics but this course is called ""Fundamentals of Quantitative Modeling"" and does very good what is supposed to do.The reason I am not giving it a perfect score is because I felt like the assignments were too easy and the videos were a bit too long relative to the amount of information provided.",4
101500,Good course,4
101501,Great course covering all the fundamentals and well paced for working professionals.,5
101502,Very insightful and excellent explanation by the videos.,5
101503,"A little too basic, but still good.",3
101504,Course provides a sound foundation in quantitative modeling. Instructor is clear and provides real world examples. I like that I could download the course powerpoint which allowed me to take notes while watching the videos. I feel confident about proceeding to the next course and hopefully through the entire specialization. The only reason I didn't give the course 5 stars is because I think there could be better tie-in with the e-book. I found the e-book to be marginally helpful.,4
101505,Excellent foundational knowledge.,5
101506,"A good introductory course but it would have been nice to see a bit more of the math behind the models. I don't think the assessments were worth upgrading to the paid version of the course though. They were basically memorization and regurgitation directly from the lecture videos with very little, if any, thinking required. A bit disappointing from an institution like Wharton.",3
101507,This course was very useful in applying my knowledge of quantitative methods from research to business situations. Professor Waterman did an excellent job of parsing the fundamentals without losing the finer details.,5
101508,Would it be possible to explain interdependent models as well?,4
101509,"Classes had clear explanations and practical examples. I wish we had dug a little deeper in the themes, but I understand this is a fundamentals' course.",4
101510,I enjoyed the content & the delivery,5
101511,"I took this course as I wanted to discover the Quantitative side of Business Modeling. And Thanks to Sir Richard Waterman, I loved the concepts and understood them easily. I look forward to associate myself with UPenn in near future :)",5
101512,A really good introduction to Quantitative Models. I will personally recommend it for beginners since it wraps up main concepts.,4
101513,Excellent introduction to the mathematical fundamentals used in quantitative modeling.,5
101514,Great course with some,5
101515,"The course is poor. Exams are too easy, video lessons are boring and not engaging. Content is poor too. Did not like the course.",1
101516,Very informative!,5
101517,please improve hand-out for self study.,3
101518,"I found the course very interesting. My only regret is that the course was only four weeks long, as I found myself wanting to dig further into the different types of models.",4
101519,"I think this was a very good course. Level of instruction and pace were appropriate for someone with 2 hours/week to spend and who wanted to improve their knowledge of these topics. Its probably more useful for someone with some previous experience, limited time and some problems they want to solve, rather than a student. It had a good balance between a lot of breadth for time invested. If you approach this as a high-level overview that will help you efficiently focus your own search for knowledge it's extremely well done; I thought knowledge communicated for the amount of time spent was quite high.",5
101520,Great Experience.Thank you,5
101521,I liked the course because of its format and material. Basically it was comprehensive.I did not like the presentation and lack of practical examples. I had to force myself to concentrate at times and search other sources for more detailed insight.,2
101522,Excellent introduction to quantitative modeling. It opened my appetite for the rest of the specialization.,5
101523,Good introduction to elements of quantitative analysis and modeling for business operations.,5
101524,"Very practical and clear explanation of statistical and modeling concepts. Would be great to include some practice problems aside from the quizzes, but as a low-intensity, accessible introduction this course is great.",4
101525,The course was very useful in introducing me to the basic concepts of modelling. I am now familiar with the necessary vocabulary to participate in conversations about modelling. It also refreshed my intuition on the basic mathematical functions. Most interesting part was the steps I have to follow when I want to construct a particular model in order to help me in answering questions about a business process.I also found out that this is a continuous process and usually I might not construct good one from the first time. I am looking forward to the next stages and so far I would definitely recommend it to my friends!,5
101526,"clear and specific, better teaching than my university",5
101527,"The learned instructor Mr Richard Waterman is great in explaining sophisticated mathematical/statistical terms or concepts in simple, concise and easy-to-understand way. Great and useful for mature working professional who are out of touch with mathematics/statistics.",5
101528,Great introduction into mathematical ways to model real complex problems.,5
101529,Good materials for the fundamentals of quantitative modeling. Need to pick up some maths and stats theories to help read the materials.,5
101530,"Great explanations provided by Prof. Waterman, however for the price of this course (in my view quite expensive) the materials available are quite poor (e.g. the formulas shown in the pdf slides are a mess, not a mathematical summary, etc), and the level of the quizzes is very basic. I would have expected much more from a course coming from Whaton.",2
101531,Very good introductory material. Complex things broken down and explained in very simple terms by the instructor. Thank you so much for providing the course.,5
101532,"I just finished the 3/4 week for this course and so far it's been an excellent class, however I don't understand why you need to upgrade to get your quiz graded. I understand that you should pay to get a certificate, I find it totally acceptable, but I don't agree with being charged just to know how well you did.I plan on taking the full specialization (minus the Capston Project) and I'm hoping the next courses are as good as this one!",5
101533,Very clear understanding of complex models.,5
101534,"Builds solid foundation and covers the basics of quantitative models. Nice introduction to regression. Really looking forward to next course, which would teach spreadsheet implementation.I think this course will help professionals and students from a variety of fields, i.e. marketing, sales, banking and finance, Information Technology, etc. Keep up the good work, Coursera and Wharton Online.",5
101535,Good Course to get started,4
101536,very informative,5
101537,This course gives us very fundamental idea of quantitative modeling but advanced modeling and/or tools. It's good for entre level students.,4
101538,Assignments should be evaluated for all users (unpaid ones as well) like it is done for other Wharton courses.,3
101539,A good starting point for quantitative modeling. I am looking forward to taking the next courses in the series.,4
101540,This course was a good refresher of mathematical and statistical concepts. I found the mathematical and statistical concepts applied to modelling interesting. I never knew that what I learned in high school in the past can actually be used to come up with models to solve business problems. Some videos were a bit long though.,3
101541,Perfect pace,5
101542,Clarity of the contents discussed was excellent.,5
101543,Interesting introduction to models.,5
101544,"Very good introduction to Business in general (stats, profit, elasticity...). Many topics are approached and it was very interesting to refresh my memory on important modeling concepts that I encountered during my bachelor.Very well explained, without being too detailed, the focus is on the main characteristics of business modeling concepts.",5
101545,Overall good course. Although I think some external resources could been provided to allow students to pursue more content related with the materials.,5
101546,"I have been in IT and business areas for so many years and I need a very concise and very pragmatic way of forming useful models. I only viewed week one materials. I have to admit that the professor, the materials and the course design have been extremely impressive. I would highly recommend, to anyone, IT or business managers, professionals in all areas to take this course. Because Modeling and Data Analytics will facilitate much better business decisions and make us better thinkers.",5
101547,Pretty awesome!!!,5
101548,Exciting and very user-friendly!,5
101549,This is an excellent course.,5
101550,Quality stuff,5
101551,Great course!,5
101552,The material is excellent as an introductory course,5
101553,"The most challenging course of the specialisation, as the concepts are fairly technical and the quizzes demand a bit more ""thinking around the corner"". Sean Pinder's videos and slides are excellent. The quality of the exam materials was not quite up to par (several issues were reported by users and fixed later on).",4
101554,"The pinnacle of all of the course. Overall, the structure is very well established from course 1-4 in the specialization.",5
101555,Wonderful course. It's having a great learning value.,5
101556,Excellent series of courses. Wish I had done a specialization and had more time to do a better job.Perhaps I will do the Capstone project.,4
101557,The course requires you to engage in focussed writing and develops your understanding of the technical requirements of scripts. I was lucky to get some really helpful comments from peers that resulted in revisions to my work that I think are a real improvement!,5
101558,A great course to wake yourself up and get running in the world of script writing. I recommend this course to every individual who is ready to work and earn rather than just buying a online certificate. Finally David sir small but powerful video sessions are excellent. Do not go by the length of the videos. They are absolutely to the point.,5
101559,"I really loved taking this course. It forced me to sit down and write almost every day, and I really appreciate that. I've learned so much, and I love the fact that I can learn things from fellow students.",4
101560,I'm ALREADY optimistic about my confidence and capabilities. I write down crazy ideas all of the time. This will not give me a framework for which I can have tons of fun and maybe get a show out there!,4
101561,"Inspiring, direct, practical and very well structured.",5
101562,Learned a ton about Script writing. Who cares if it is MSU or any other University. The Professor teaching is what makes all of the difference.,5
101563,"Fantastic, hand-on opportunity. You can't learn to write unless you are doing a project. Great course structure!",5
101564,"You will learn nothing from this. The teacher is useless and you only get peer-feedback. While I usually love peer feedback, I lost all interest so quickly.",1
101565,"This course was a really good surprise. A nice way to end 2016 and start 2017. I was scared cause of language, once I'm not a native speaker, so that was an extra challenge for me. But everyone here helped. The mentor was great and always ready to help, the peers were nice and always giving tips of how I could improve the script and now I don't look to Celtx program like a seven heads monsters, anymore. Actually, it is really easy to work on it. I'm really glad I did this course.",5
101566,"Amazing course. Without useless talking, we are immediately thrown into action, and start working immediately. This course helped me gain priceless empiric experience, and finally start writing.",5
101567,"There was little of actual teaching going on in this course, the pace was too rushed for beginners and peer-reviewing was managed so poorly it was unhelpful.",1
101568,I was surprised that we don't suppose to learn about writing scripts. Because the best way to learn is to write the script. It wasn't easy for me as not a native speaker. But I finished it! I recommend this course! Jan is the best mentor! Thank you very much!,5
101569,I Loved Dr. David Wheeler's method. I will enroll in his course/courses over and over again since I want to learn more.,5
101570,"Very enjoyable course! However, I think that it would have been nice to have some more professional viewing of our work, since several of us were taking in this information for the first time.",4
101571,"Through this course, I transformed a scene I wrote for a full length movie into a pilot for TV. I'm happy I learned the process and I'm working on the series episodes to follow. Thank You for developing this course. The lessons were explained well and the videos were very helpful. I'm especially glad this course was presented through Michigan State University. That was a deciding factor in signing up for it. Go Spartans!",5
101572,"I really enjoy screenwriting and this course has not only gave me some interesting points but also, help me develop my own tv show idea and start writing it. It's really good so far!",5
101573,Here are great Professor，Mentor and other Teachers.,5
101574,I understood the point that in script writing matters more than theory but I don't think that it's right that all marks I got I received from other with me with zero feedback from lectors and teachers.Definitely I wouldn't pay for sertificate but as first step and making some ready draft for further polishing the script this course was enough. So from one side it helped me to move forward with my idea but on other hand I didn't get any professional feedback and advices from teacher. There were some very useful comments from other students but I also need some help from people who are real professionals in it.,3
101575,"Great course. Learned a great deal about script writing. Much of the peer feedback was very helpful and useful, but a small portion of the peers were did not seem to be very engaged or helpful.",4
101576,"This was a great course for anyone who has ever wanted to try their hand at script writing. I am brand new to script writing and I applied every lesson I learned in this course and did some research on my own to develop my pilot. You will feel accomplished once you complete this class, it is worth it!",5
101577,I am SO glad I found this course online!,5
101578,"The course was great in that it moves you to write. I actually completed a pilot script that I was very proud of. My only criticism of the course would be the peer review. For the most part the reviews were weak and lacking substance. I put a lot of energy into reviewing classmates works but I can't say that I got back what I put out. This may be improved with a video teaching students what kind of feedback is expected of them. Other than that, it's worth the time.",4
101579,"As a professional actor I knew the ability to write my own material would be an invaluable skill. I've been writing tv/film ideas for years without a the slightest clue as to go about creating a full story in script form. Having no formal training, this class was the perfect introduction into the craft. Professor David Wheeler simplified the intimidating feat of writing a tv pilot into a realistically executable series of steps. I will definitely be revisiting this course in the future.",5
101580,"I learnt a lot . I am most appreciative of reviewers who spent a great deal of time reading my work, and leaving constructive comments.",5
101581,"Script Writing: Write a Pilot Episode for a TV Course changed my life. I took several courses in Coursera at the time, but this was the most engaging. It really made want to learn and to achieve the goal of producing a final script. I recommend it to all who look for a real way to understand the process of writing for a TV show.",5
101582,"I found this a hugely useful course. I really liked it's minimalism and found it a great writing prompt.My only criticism was the way the feedback and critique is set up. I found it didn't encourage people to do written analysis of what they liked and didn't like. Sometimes I didn't myself because after I wrote a critique, I would loose it by pressing the submit button before the post button.",4
101583,"Excellent quality assignments. Really the best online writing course I've found. This is a teacher that knows what he's doing, and how to draw out the best of his students' unique ideas and talents.",4
101584,"Positives:-Good practice with the exciting world of script writingLearnt how to use the scriptwriting software Celtx.comSome aspects of the videos were helpful and instructive e.g. teaching us how to write a cold openAreas of improvement:-The beginner's course is entirely graded on peer reviews where one could get a range of divergent opinions on the same story, at times scathing and not constructive. Reviewers (who are purported to be beginners themselves) also at times give seemingly 'blind' grades without sharing constructive comments.The questions that you are graded on e.g. Do you feel immersed in the story? Is the story unique? are highly subjective and solely dependent on the reviewer's fleeting preferences. It would help if the questions were more nuanced and focused on the structure and technical aspects of script writing e.g. format, grammar, three part structureLessons were too short and instructional (less than 10 mins of videos for each lesson) only for certain areas; it seemed like one of the major takeaways was to keep writing which is sensible but not helpful from a beginner's point of view.Suggestions:-To maintain some objectivity in grading: Mask the general comments section when a reviewer is giving his comments as negative comments from other peers could influence more negativity and vice versa.Give some guidelines on reviewing to prevent the grading process from turning into trolling.Would appreciate more helpful lessons with deeper content!",4
101585,Quite exciting from the first video lesson itself. Great motivation and guidance.,5
101586,"Fantastic course, loved the way it walked you step by step through the process and the formatting. This course could have been ten weeks and still wouldn't be enough. Awesome hands on learning.",5
101587,I enjoyed this class. It is very open and organic. Creativity is encouraged and very few restrictions and rules are imposed. I found the class to be well-taught and I looked forward to participating in every week of class.,5
101588,"Very methodical, but still makes writing fun... and exciting.",5
101589,Straight to the point. The way any writing course should be. Brilliant.,5
101590,"Script Writing: Write a Pilot Episode for a TV or Web Series is a very challenging course. However, if you goal is to write a TV Pilot, this is",5
101591,"I loved this course, it was eye opening for me. I've always loved writing but I've never studied it. taking this course helped me explore my writing more.I totally recommend it to anyone!",5
101592,"this course will make you write a script... and that's it, if you want to LEARN how to write a script, don't take this course.This course just push you to write a script without clearly teaching you what to do, if you want to learn, look for another course (I took one from futurelearn.com while in this course, it's free, this one is a waste of money if you pay)",1
101593,"This isn't a CLASS it's a workshop.Thank goodness for fee waivers; I would have been so upset if I had spent my money on this course. As someone who has taken Coursera offerings in the past, I cannot cosign the quality of this course.This class seems to suffer from both a lack of structure and time. I believe if the course was longer (allowing for more space between unguided assignments) the class would be a little better. I understand that the Instructor is barred by time constraints (this is only a five week course, and an opt-in one at that), so I do relate to not wanting to inundate the class with reading assignment and lengthy lectures.That said, the guidance and lessons are lacking-- even if the class was longer, I would still only give it 2.5/5 stars.It appeared that the onus was on the Mentors to provide answers; for example, the professor mentioned that our scripts are meant to feature half hour pilots. This left many students writing dramas rather than comedies at a loss, since they were planning for hour long pilots. (This, again, is partially an issue of the class being so short; more time to review = the option to have longer pilots, rather than only accepting half hour pilots in order to allow students to review five different submissions within three days.) Since half hour dramas are unconventional, I asked one of our mentors, JZ (who is great) for examples.The responsibility should not be on the Mentors to find out-- information like that should be included in the prompt; if not discussed in depth, then at least as a link or list of examples to research on your own if you have the time + desire to do so. Especially since the assignment boils down to ""break convention with no examples of successful scripts in this fashion."" In a class presumably allowing beginningeres/greenhorns to participate, this is irresponsible and flawed teaching.The same goes of the ""hints"" that are periodically posted (though again, appreciated!) by mentors in the forums-- those definitions and explanations should be included in the meat of the class, not as supplemental elements. In all honesty, if I didn't have prior experience with writing, I oftentimes wouldn't have any idea what was being discussed by the professor. (And one trip through the forums will illustrate that I am not the only one.)The assignments and due dates are oddly crunched together (another time constraint issue, I understand), but the Instructor's videos seem to imply that we should be receiving feedback before proceeding each time? Maybe in a longer course that would work, but here, I didn't even receive written feedback initially, so it would have been a mistake to wait for some to revise by before forging ahead.If this class isn't going to provide a solid foundation to build on, then it should be made clear, upfront. There is nothing wrong with an experience based / motivation-focused class, but that aspect needs to be transparent. ""We will not provide 101 teachings/readings."" This isn't a class; it's a workshop. It's a makerspace at best. I expected insight and some level of instruction.In one of the lectures, the Instructor literally says:""I'm not a big fan of some of the classic story structures, defining in what must happen in each act. Or the problem, the twist, the resolution, rising action, denouement, fine action, etc."" He does not define these terms, nor allude to them ever again. These are key benchmarks in screenwriting. Definitions would be helpful for someone just starting out, even if the Instructor doesn't strictly want us to abide by them. His students should leave the class more informed than when they came.Unless you're lucky and receive a response from a mentor or someone with visible background in script writing, the reviews don't amount to much, because very few enrollees seem to know what is going on enough to provide a meaty assessment. That is the fault of the course, I think, rather than my peers. Likewise, The grading system here is atrocious because of it; few people understand the foundation, and thusly don't know how to format or structure. So to then be graded on a purely pass or fail basis (that, looking through the forums, many students weren't even AWARE of until the first review grades rolled in) is ridiculous. And I am saying that as someone that scored 100% on both assignments that I did stay to complete, so this is not a case of sour grapes, but an observation of inefficiency.I understand that the class is based around ""Active Learning"", but for active learning to work and bear fruit, students should be able to engage with/analyze/synthesize/evaluate/build upon class content. Which necessitates actual, meaningful content. Content beyond my fellow confused peers, and 2 minute videos illustrating various ways of saying ""Write Something Interesting and if it isn't Interesting, people won't care."" Not exactly an astute observation that we couldn't glean anywhere but this course.Honestly, my 4th Edition copy of ""The Screenwriters Bible"" is five times more helpful than this course, and it is about six years out of date.",2
101594,"I'm sorry, but I have taken many courses on Coursera and this is, without a doubt, the absolute worst. This isn't minimal teaching, it's practically nonexistent. Frankly, buying a book would at least give more guidance than tossing one-minute 'lectures' out there and having students blindly fend for themselves under the guise of ""experimental learning"".Plus, you then have an all or nothing grade system - there is no middle ground, just pass or fail on an assignment that had little to no instruction or examples listed to begin with.I'm truly surprised that Coursera agreed to allow this course as it is. I suggest that the instructor and team see how other instructors at universities are teaching their Coursera courses. Just because something is free, it doesn't give free reign to be lazy. If I had paid for it, I would have asked for a refund. This entire course needs a serious revamp.",1
101595,"David Wheeler is awesome, and I love this course! I am so glad that Coursera and Michigan State University have partnered to offer this course to those of us who have a thirst for learning! Thank you!",5
101596,Wonderful class to get that idea out of your head and on paper...finally!!!,5
101597,"Eventually I got my head around it. It was a challenging but I was concerned about being told to 'just do it' when I had no idea what I was just to do. I think the beginning was a little confusing, and also reading others scripts when there was no background to understand where it was going.",5
101598,"What a lazy excuse of a course. Why would you call it a course? Just call it ""Start Writing"" and put it on a blog. No guidance, no tips, no effort whatsoever. Without any guidelines, how does review from a fellow novice help? It's like blind leading the blind.I'll go with the minimalist style of this course and use just one word to describe it: Rubbish.",1
101599,This is a fun and challenging course.,5
101600,"This course is a great introduction to the art of script writing. You'll gain an understanding of basic script formatting, get in the habit of writing consistently and have the benefit of your script being reviewed by peers.",4
101601,"I should suggest my fellow Coursera students not to waste their money and time for this course. You'll learn a lot more than this course has to offer if you consult some websites with screenwriting tutorial blogs, read books and write on your own.I am a PhD student of theoretical film studies and and a fan of Coursera courses. I was eager to learn screenwriting as an interesting hands-on course. Well, it's project-based alright, but where's the real guidance??This is a lazily designed course with poor content and almost zero guidance. The videos are very short and feels like a layman is trying to motivate you to write something, that's all. No methods explained other than some terminologies like bible, acts, outline being thrown at you. No examples, no comparisons, no detailed approaches.Lastly, scriptwriting has a significant difference with other humanities course. Being peer-reviewed doesn't help here -- a total novice can not effectively judge another newbie's work nor give them quality feedback.",1
101602,"I thoroughly enjoyed this class. It gives you an excellent regiment and list of characteristics that would make your pilot and potential series desirable. My only real issue, which makes it 4 instead of 5 stars, is that the student feedback is somewhat limited in that not all students really understand how to give notes. Often times they are very vague (""good effort, write with move consision"") not offering enough particulars to know what you should be looking to improve. But that's the inherent limitation of a course offered in this format. Not a reflection on the curriculum itself.",4
101603,"I loved the course and content, but, found the process cumbersome. I think that some of these issues have now been addressed and should not present a problem in future programs.",3
101604,"Such a great course. Jumping in and just doing it worked for me, as I tend to spend time reading up and educating myself theoretically before ever getting around to actually writing. Seeing sample scripts and discussions of form and writing criteria is definitely important, as I have managed to learn a lot through looking at many scripts and comparing, so I think there's a place for that in the course, but the actual project base was what really made the difference for me. The grading criteria points with every assignment have functioned as vital checklists in which to review not just my peers, but also my own work as well. I really learned a whole lot more about stretching my limits and what I am capable of doing by actually writing than just by dreaming of doing it one day. My confidence is at an all-time high, and now I am actively revising the pilot and working on the following episodes, as well as actively seeking opportunities for further courses, contests, and screenwriter communities and associations. Thank you, David. Before this course, I never actually thought I'd do it, and decided to sign up on a whim because I love writing and I love film and TV, but I never even considered screenwriting as a career or an option, and now this has all been changed. I am forever grateful. Please come back and give more courses on the different facets of writing for the screen, like developing compelling characters, world building, genre tips, etc. Your support has been phenomenal. Thanks to Michigan State University, Coursera, and all of my peers for the amazing encouragement and support.",5
101605,"Well-paced course that encourages you to write, and sets reasonable deadlines that are so important for procrastinators. Don't agree with the statements that reading scripts and watching films won't help you as a writer, as I've found doing both extremely useful in learning to analyze and write more efficiently and effectively. Enjoyed the sessions, got some good feedback, and am continuing to work on the subsequent episodes of my new series.",4
101606,"I really enjoyed this class. I would say that it is a lot of work in a short period of time. Also there were some issues with the peer review process. For example not knowing the criteria we would be graded on before submitting the assignments, many students unable to get enough reviews to move forward especially if they had to revise their assignment. Hopefully, this will be worked out for future versions. Overall, it was an interesting process.",4
101607,It was wonderful to get writing again and to get all the wonderful feedback from my classmates.,5
101608,"I like the course, it is pretty good to learn screenplay, butThey need to explain a little some topics that new writers maybe don't understand. Submerge more in some topics and explain it.",3
101609,"Quite good introductory course on script writing, enjoyed writing my first pilot episode of my series",4
101610,"There is no instruction with this course. If you've never written a script before you're not going to get a lot of help here other than researching things yourself, which you can do without this course. Not to mention, the feedback is minimal and not all that helpful. For example. if i've never written a script, what value am I to someone else who has also never written a script. And what value is their feedback to me. I signed up to get some experience and to also get feedback from those more experienced than I. I'm less interested in what my peers have to say and more interested in the feedback of the instructor who has years more experience than most of us. To pass assignments off of 4 or 5 peer reviews is worthless. There's no value in that. What does the instructor think??? Would HE pass us? He occasionally drops a line in the discussion forum, but no direct feedback to the students.I think this class should have a cap on enrollment so that the instructor can actually review and provide feedback to the students. Joke's on anyone paying $49 to essentially teach yourself. This guys just sits back and ""moderates"" when he can.The best thing about this class is that it does force you to write, but beyond that, it's not helpful at all. Truly disappointing.",1
101611,"The instructor says in the first video: ”you do not need to read a book on how to write a script” – in my opinion YOU DO! Better to read a book or two than waste your time on this course; the videos are extremely short, shallow and a waste of time!",1
101612,"I have found this course to be well planned out, easy to follow and very informative. I have been considering scriptwriting for some time and even bought books on how to get started but this course has been much more effective than any book. This course has given me the tools and the know-how of what is required to write a script.I am in my last week at the moment and the confidence and skills this project-centered course has given me are immeasurable.",5
101613,"One of the best courses I have ever taken. When I first started this course, I began with a passion and throughout each week, it was starting to become a reality. Thank you David Wheeler.",5
101614,really really nice and helpfull.,4
101615,"I'm actually writing my first TV series pilot. This is the furthest I've ever gotten. I love this course. Thanks to David Wheeler, everyone at Michigan State University and Coursera for making this accessible to so many. Sending tons of gratitude from Daniella Horsford.",5
101616,"No significant instruction/teaching provided. Appears to function only as a self-directed workshop, which doesn't teach the craft itself. Disappointing.",1
101617,There isn't any real teaching happening. I guess this isn't a course for beginners.,1
101618,"No real teaching attempted in this course, as far as I can see...",2
101619,"I am in love with this course. Having never written a script before, or any substantive fiction since college (15 years ago) I had a small idea in my head that has now exploded into something I really believe in. David's guidance is spot on, he's his on compelling story teller, he give you enough, and then you have to figure it out, make it happen, WRITE! WRITE! WRITE!",5
101620,Very interesting course!!,5
101621,"Very interesting course about Spark, it covers a lot of key concepts!",4
101622,Good introduction to Spark. One thing that I didn't like was use of simple Ints and Strings instead of types.,4
101623,"Pretty nice course. But with one comment on the grading system, sometime the comment & message is not that intuitive enough.",5
101624,"Yet another excellent Scala class. Good lectures, good assignments. Clear and understandable, while presenting a whole bunch of new concepts.",5
101625,This course is very well done.,5
101626,Instructor has been explaining the concepts with more practical direction,5
101627,"Taking into consideration that this was the first edition of the course, I can say that it has been a nice journey. I am glad about the fact that Heather managed to expose a bit of the Spark internals and not only talk about querying data and how easily this can be made by using Spark (as most of the Spark oriented courses consist of).In addition to this, I could listen to Heather all day long - she's a great presenter and has wonderful teaching skills.However, the homework has outlined some neglected aspects of the course:- vague description or requirements- not strongly related to the presented content (the lectures outlined partitioning mechanism, but the homework 2 did not require it...)- not so meaningful feedback, except for some tests failing/passing - I would have expected something like you did ok, but your job took longer than expected; check out this and thatOverall, it's been a highly expected course and it was nice to get a broader outlook on Spark. I hope that there will be more courses (and more detailed) related to Spark ecosystem in the near future.",4
101628,"Great course, I learned a lot through the course. However, some of the lectures are quite long and could do with being broken down in to more smaller segments.",4
101629,Great course - well prepared by the team.,5
101630,"Gives a really solid overview of the foundations of the Spark programming model, where it came from, and how latency affects this model for a distributed cluster. Explains well the key differenced between RDDs, Datasets, and Dataframes. Thought the videos were unnecessarily long and could do with ""sharpening"" them up a bit.",4
101631,"The selection of content is very good. Yet, the course requires solid amount of polishing. I had a feeling that the real teaching started only in the 4th week, with lots of walking around the subject in the beginning. Worth to mention that in contrast to the first 3 courses in Scala specialisation this one is very heavy on visual aspect. You actually have to see the picture, as the voice channel just references it.I can certainly recommend this course to people curious about data analysis. If you have had some experience and would like to try Spark or get better at it, then probably a good book can save your time.",3
101632,"Learned Spark APIs, internals.",4
101633,Would be better to have more and shorter exercises.,4
101634,"a let down and not up to par with other courses in the series.Huge amount of time is wasted bsically repeating that the API is close to scala collections'. The huge amout of time is wasted again on very simple dataframe APIs including several slides presenting the show() function. Allow me to repeat : several slides presenting the show() function.Finally the assignments are unimaginative and mechanical. The desciption is really confuse and most of the time is spend trying to chase small differences away to please the grader.The sole part of the course that seemed interesting was the shuffling one, that was unfourtunately ignored on the assignmentsNot related to the course but to spark: What utter mess are dataframes and datasets filled with boilerplate type conversions and runtime erros. I shy away in disgust form this untyped IDE-unfriendly monstruosity.",2
101635,This course is a great introduction to Spark. The only thing I think could be improved is that each programming assignments has unit tests that drive students towards the final solution. I saw lots of people complaining in the forums about this slow and tedious back and forth of having the grader testing their code.,5
101636,"This is a really excellent course. It deals with difficult content clearly, thoroughly and at a good pace. I would now be happy to use Spark in my work and feel I have a strong base to go on to further study. The exercises are well conceived covering fairly realistic use cases and are of about the right complexity. BUT, the feedback from the automatic grading really lets it down.The auto grading tests are at too high a granularity, each test tests too many things. They give cryptic errors such as '<some random element> is empty'. You have no idea why the element is empty as the students are given a different dataset to the one tested on. Moreover, the failed tests are invariably nothing to do with learnt course content, but trivial rounding/formatting errors. The forums are a lifesaver, but I still spent a good two weekends working on bugs once I'd got the assignments 70% right. I would not recommend to a completist!All the same, thanks to Heather for the wonderful work she's done putting it together and the excellent lectures she gives.",3
101637,Very Very Interesting and helpful!The slides' layout is very clear and step by step for each important topic.The motivation of why we need dataframe and dataset and what's their difference is explained with a logical and reasonable way!,5
101638,I really liked the content regarding Dataframes and Datasets.,4
101639,It was good. Got indepth knowledge of Spark API,5
101640,"Informative. Although, it a week course on architecture of Spark (especially YARN mode), explaining Spark Jobs, Stages & Tasks would be nice addition. Thank you for sharing knowledge and a wonderful learning experience!",4
101641,I like the course tempo very much. It kept me away from doing anything else while listening to the lectures.,5
101642,It was well worth the wait! The instructor was good. Assignments were challenging as well as hands on!,5
101643,Amazingly polished and well taught course although being given for the first time,5
101644,"I understand that creating such a course is a tremendous amount of work. Let me congratulation the developers for all their hard work. I learned a lot. I'm glad I good the course, and I'm speechless that I finally finished it with a passing albeit imperfect score. This was the maiden voyage and it has some problems that should probably be corrected. That's my opinion.There were generally two sets of challenges with each assignment exercise (1) undemanding the scala/big-data component, and (2) understand what's being asked. Sometimes the comment in the code are wrong or misleading. In particular in the 2nd set of exercises. The functions are very poorly specified, and there are no unit tests. there should be one or the other. Without a specification the user cannot write his own tests. In addition the 2nd exercise is intended to be do-able, but not efficiently until the user views week 3's videos. Because of this the text output is EXTREMELY verbose, making it impossible to read the error messages and understand them. When the user finally submits the assignment it fails and the grader gives misleading error messages. A failing unit test should at the very least explain what the test was, what the measured value was, and what was expected. This is especially true when the user is forbidden from looking at the actual testing code. An additional problem with exercise 2, is that the student is asked to calculate a particular percentage, but it is not explained what this is a percentage OF and there are several ways to interpret it. I didn't realize until wasting 2 weeks that there was an alternate interpretation which I could try.In the 3rd exercise some of the comments in the code are wrong/misleading. Particularly with regard to classifiedColumns. comment #3 should read:* 3. other activities (leisure). These are the columns starting with “t02”, “t04”, “t06”, “t07”, “t08”, “t09”, “t10”, “t12”, “t13”, “t14”, “t15”, “t16” and “t18” BUT EXCLUDING those which are not part of the previous groups only. Otherwise the sentence is at best grammatically incorrect, and at worst misleading.Another significant issue with this ""Bit Data"" course is that it assumes a user understands data base and can construct sql queries. Well, such background is not a prerequisite, but the student needs such information to successfully finish the exercises. I can understand the temptation by the course developers to include a section on SQLspark, as this is a very powerful set of spark libraries, but I believe it is beyond the prerequisites. I could not have finished the course if I hadn't had an SQL/data-base expert in the same office, who I could pose questions to.I hope you find my comments useful.",3
101645,"good stuff, compared to the other similar course in PySpark this one gave me a lot more understanding of how things work in Spark on the low level",5
101646,Generally a really good introduction to Spark. What I found disturbing though were the very imbalanced difficulties of the excercises and the rather uninformative test messages that did not help for the implementation. There was no course where I had to search for other peoples suggestions in the forums.Still the course was good -- I would do it again!,4
101647,"Quizzes in the lecture videos would be nice. Also more, but shorter videos would be enjoyable. Programming assignments very nice!",4
101648,"Great introduction to spark. Fun assignments. Since it was the first ever session, there were quite a few kinks with the assignments. But the discussion forums rescued me any time I was stuck.",5
101649,Great course! The powerpoint/slides/pdfs are a GREAT resource,5
101650,"I don't know what happened but it seems they had technical or some other problem while preparing this course. Some assignments were more oriented to solving marginal problems then using Spark and distributed and parallel computing. And that is really annoying. Previous 3 courses were great, maybe this one will improve.",1
101651,First weeks were overcomplicated with k-means and stuff not related to Spark itself.In general - GREAT JOB !!! Thx for such kind courses,5
101652,"It is a course well organized, full of useful notions e with good assignments to assess your progress in learning stuff.",5
101653,Production quality exercises. Prepares one for working on Spark almost immediately.,5
101654,"Great course overall. The feedback on failed tests and out of memory errors on the assignments can be improved to make it more user-friendly.Would be great to see a more advanced version of this course that dives deeper into the machine learning features of Spark, etc.",5
101655,"Very good course, but it needs more details and examples.",4
101656,"Great course, well explained, instant value!",5
101657,Best Spark Scala course! Clear explanation! Thanks Dr. Heather,5
101658,This course is a nice guided way to get started with Apache Spark! I wish I took this course earlier when i was using Spark at my previous company. It would've come in handy. Plenty of great content and the course exercises supply good practice.,5
101659,Just awesome :),5
101660,Cool :),5
101661,Demystified the subject for me. I felt like the lecturer covered a considerable amount of material in relatively short time. The assignments helped to cement the knowledge acquired over the duration of the course.,5
101662,Good course ! But does need more programming assignments,4
101663,"This is a great course on the intricacies of Apache Spark. It is not a general Big Data course, neither is it an easy one. Doing the programming assignments properly requires reading a lot trough the Spark documentation, which I personally liked as part of the challenge, but beware if you are not that type of person or aim at finishing the course as quickly as possible.",5
101664,Excellent material. Very good flow. Heather has an amazing way of walking through the flow and simplifying the concepts. Great assignments -- takes a bit longer than 3 hours.,5
101665,The course gave me insight into the world och big data batch processing and how Spark solves it. Heather does a great job with presenting the material in a thorough way with relevant theory and illustrative examples. The assignments are well balanced and forces you to apply all your new knowledge when solving them. I highly recommend this course!,5
101666,A very interesting and useful course.Highly Recommended!,5
101667,Great Material and lecture videos. It covered important concepts we need to know about Spark and helped me to learn further. Assignments were on real datasets and helped me to explore different APIs if Spark and Scala.,5
101668,"Really helpful, it's a really good way to get to know how spark works as well as a good round up on basic data mining.",5
101669,Lectures were clear and engaging and directly related to the homework. The assignments were very practical and very hard. Best course of the series!,5
101670,It is very good course material for Spark with scala.,5
101671,Thanks,5
101672,"Course material was pretty good, but the lectures were hard to watch. Lots of editing problems, and blurring on the text (gave me a headache several times). Would rate higher if the videos were improved.",2
101673,"Great, short course, which gives great insight into Spark and ad-hoc data processing on Hadoop-ish clusters.",5
101674,"Nice course, could use little fixes. Sometimes practice goes ahead of theory",4
101675,"Took a bit long before the course actually started, but when it did, it was a great course!",4
101676,"As always, Coursera delivered another top quality courses on Spark with Scala. I have learned a lot of details, understood the underlying working principles of Spark in the last few days. Thanks to Dr. Miller for such a great course. I hope in the future versions of this course the overall presentations will be more smooth and typo-free.",5
101677,"great course, finally understand what spark is all about!",5
101678,Excellent teacher,5
101679,"Very good and interesting videos. Really clear explanations. Practice part worse, but Forum helps with all misunderstandings.",5
101680,"Dr Heather has done an outstanding job to create this unique material with a fine combination of theoretical and practical aspect of Spark. She has covered almost everything from basic to complex, but there is some area which demands more time from the creator for its explanations. Since this is first time launched course and definitely going to improve itself in upcoming days. I enjoyed this course thoroughly. It helped me, cementing my basic concept of Spark.",4
101681,"Awesome! Perhaps couple of tests would be handy, just a few to have something to start with.",5
101682,very nicely taught,5
101683,Enjoyed the course and learnt lots. Stimulating material. Though I feel that the week 4 material could be made more concise. On the whole would recommend to other interested and it will definitely help in my career.,5
101684,Very Good! Maybe more examples!,5
101685,"Great introduction course to Spark with excellent materials and hand-on programming assignments. Thanks for taking effort to get this class online. I have enjoyed it very much.Kudos to Professor Miller, we love you :-)",5
101686,Very good course.,5
101687,"Very interesting course. Heather presents at just right level of abstraction to my taste and her presentation is very lively so it is easy to stay focused.Formally, this is a course on a particular set of software tools and many such courses are not very useful unless one is to start applying learned skills immdeiately because the material starts getting obsolete the day the course is passed.I believe that this course, however, teaches important priniples that outlive the particular toolkit, in particular the art of reasoning about algorithms on distributed collections, in particular, their performance. One would expect this to be a complex subject but somehow this course makes it feel simple -- which is a good indicator of high quality.",5
101688,"Good information, but a little rough around the edges, possibly due to being its first time out of the gate. Should be amplified with additional weeks of topics, e.g. on Spark Streaming, etc.The Grader often returns opaque errors (""The Grader Failed""), when the actual problem was that the program ran out of memory or out of disk space. Grader can reject solutions, e.g. on the last assignment, if the programmer uses a different rounder implementation that returns subtly-different results, though the results print out as the same to the rounded degree of precision.The Grader should be written to accept results that are ""acceptably close"" to the desired result, e.g. if the desired result is 34.1, to accept perhaps numbers between 34.099 and 34.101 -- perhaps consult with other course-runners for best practices here.It might be helpful if the course provided a quick intro to running the assignments on DataBricks.Good first effort.",3
101689,very nice material and organized very well. still amazed what spark can do with the data.,5
101690,"The course was interesting but it was clear that it is the first iteration. The course seems rushed, there are not very clear explanations on certain areas. Mostly, I had problems completing the assignments based on what I've learned during the lectures.The previous courses had difficult assignments and you had to think about how you wanted to do something, here the problem was using the Spark API and understanding things which weren't explained in the lectures. Also, not all the areas of the assignments were described.I am sure the course will become better in time.",3
101691,So great!,5
101692,Awesome Course . Detail and Depth of RDD vs Dataframe vs Dataset.Latency vs Network/IO vs Shuffling.Learnt a lot .Thank you Heather.,5
101693,Nice course. Big jump at the end. The assignment is well hinted.,5
101694,"Excellent and broad view of Spark and its design foundations. Besides the formal knowledge of Spark, it could change my perspective about how Scala and Akka had a crucial role in the Spark architecture.",5
101695,"Good overview of the subject, covering all important aspects. Assignments were well prepared, with a couple of unclear points that were quickly discovered and explained on the forums.",5
101696,I learned a lot and I really enjoyed the course. What I would improve - reference material from upcoming weeks should be organized (or at least added as recommended reading) if it helps the current week assignment.,4
101697,Nice topics regarding using partitions for Spark and encoders!! Really interesting course,5
101698,Another fun Scala course!,5
101699,good course on spark.,5
101700,This class is great! Highly recomended! It helped me to understand and perform better at my daily working tasks!,5
101701,"The structure, focus content of the videos of this course are great. The assignments are so-so. They do practice writing reasonably realistic Spark jobs in Scala, but it is hard to draw the connection between the more theoretical videos and the very practical assignments. Also, the assignments are hard to solve due to being poorly specified and there being hardly any helpful output from the auto-graders used to evaluate assignment submissions.",4
101702,"Great introduction to Spark and it's data structures. The course is easy to follow, and lecturer is entertaining and really engaged.Thanks, I really had fun !",5
101703,Fantastic initiation to Spark. Thanks Heather and the whole team at EPFL & Coursera.,5
101704,Assignment Instructions need improvement in terms of clarity.,4
101705,Very Nice and effective course. One of the best course i have done on Spark online. Many Thanks to the course instructor Heather Miller for creating a very detail and updated course on Spark.,5
101706,It's a great course with lots of insight into spark. At first it's confusing - first rdds; then dataframes and later datasets. But this is by no means the instructors' fault. Heather greatly describes in detail what goes on under the hood and why dataframes are way faster than simple rdds and why we have to give up some of our beloved typesafety of scala-land to let catalyst do its magic. Datasets try to bring some of it back.I really enjoyed coding the assignments. Took me ~2hrs each. The tasks were fun and like those you would find in the wild.I already applied some of the skills I learned here at work and successfully implemented a simple recommendation engine that will go to production next week.Highly recommend this course!,5
101707,"The material in this course is very interesting. However, there were a few important issues:Lots of typos in the slidesLots of problems with the assignmentsAt the end, I feel like a beta-tester (it would be OK if it was clearly stated and if we had a discount).It could also be nice to add 1 or 2 weeks to this course.",3
101708,"It was short and sweet. However, I wish the assignments had more unit tests to fill gaps where the instructions weren't clear.",5
101709,"goot as introduction about spark and big data.Small notice: it is incorrect to compare performance hadoop and spark. As I understand, spark was expected to be compacred with MapReduce.",5
101710,Brilliant intro to Spark. I really like the enthusiasm with which Heather explains the key concepts.,5
101711,Very fun and informative!,5
101712,"A superb course taught by a superb lecturer. From a lecture stanpoint, my only recommendation is that additional lectures be provided to flesh out the coverage of Datasets. I found the assignments challenging and a good reflection on my understanding of the course material. I would recommend only the following tweaks:Week 1 assignment: Either tightly specify the function that determines if a particular String is present in a large textstring OR provide the function in the assignment skeleton. There are too many ways to approach this function that are correct, but different than the one the grader used. This function is only incidental to the goal of applying one's knowledge of Spark to the assignment.Week 4: Allocate additional lectures to flesh out the coverage of Datasets. The subject was not covered to the same level of detail that the other subjects in the course were given.These are minor points.Well done, Dr Heather Miller!",5
101713,This course took a lot of work to create. I would have like more quizzes during the lectures and the assignments to have walk through the steps more. The best course I have seen online is the Machine learning course by Andrew Ng. https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome.I did really enjoy the course. Thank you.,3
101714,"Good material and induction to Spark, good complement of parallel computing in Scala",5
101715,Awesome course,5
101716,"Slow videos repeating several times the same thing (not a pedagogical / ""good to fix an idea"" kind of repetition), which makes them hard to follow.However the worst are the exercises: the first time after 3-4 other Coursera Scala related courses where I have to actively check the forums for minute details about what is expected / implied for the solutions to pass the grading.Things like what to do when updating the kmeans and you have duplicates, subtle differences between average and mean, etc. ...In all other courses the expectation of the exercises were sufficiently clear and straight forward that I never had to check the forums to solve them.Also, the code style of the exercises is literally an anti-pattern in idiomatic Scala, against everything learnt in the previous Scala courses: ""var"" all over the place, low level loops like in C or Java, etc. ...",1
101717,"really good, informative",5
101718,"The video speed is way to fast, this woman is speaking really fast, first as i slowed the video down at 75% was its ok.",4
101719,"Great course, keep up the good work.",5
101720,"I learned so much from this course! It was amazing how Dr. Miller used concepts that were meticulously built up in the earlier courses, such as evaluation strategy, functional collections, reactive programming, and associativity, to describe the core of Spark in only four units. As someone coming from more of a statistics background, I started this specialization only to learn Spark, so I wasn't always sure how relevant learning the more theoretical underpinnings of Scala would be. It turns out that it was pretty essential, while also just making me a better programmer. Looking forward to the capstone!",5
101721,"Very well taught and insightful! Especially the combination of slides, and additionally drawn notes on that slides, I found very good.",5
101722,Challenging but very enlightening. Requires you to read the docs and figure out a lot of stuff on your own. My kind of course!,5
101723,Interesting and challenging course! Thank You!,5
101724,"Some of the assignments are a bit challenging, due to grading system I suppose, but in the end general impression about this course is very positive",5
101725,"The course covers the important concepts and explains them in detail.Homework tasks really make you think, revisit the lectures and read documentation, until you get it right, and that all deepens understanding of the material.I also obtained some clues for the future: the lectures provided me with context, which helps formulate questions when searching for answers elsewhere.",5
101726,Thanks Heather! You did a great job with this course.,5
101727,"Great course, presentations prepared with passion, exercise of right level....",5
101728,"Lectures are great. Explanation are very clear. Assignment was having issue like incorrect and/or vague reporting which made them needlessly painfull. I'm quite sure that the next iteration of this course can get a 5 star rating, but for now, it's only 3.",3
101729,Excellent in depth explanation of RDD and the API.Heather is super informative and the material is being passed in a practical and explanatory way.Hopefully there will be more courses like this one about Spark Streaming and Machine Learning.,4
101730,Really Awesome course. The instructor is great. Looking forward to more courses from Heather.,5
101731,Great course. Very informative. I have learned a lot. Lessons are very well prepared and structured. Implementation tasks are interesting. Thanks to all EPFL team. Great job!,5
101732,"I really enjoyed this course! First of all I would like to congratulate the people behind this effort. The videos are clear, to the point and they contain very useful information and tips that are very difficult to get from a book. I hope that you will continue with a second course on Spark and Scala with more advanced topics. Thank you very much.",5
101733,Thanks! It's an excellent course.,5
101734,"This course is structured in an intuitive and easy to manage way. The lectures, who are clearly highly intelligent, package their knowledge in understandable and easy-to-grasp ways that are in no way alienating - which is what I initially expected the course would be.",5
101735,Really helpful for understanding requirements and mindset of a startup,4
101736,"They do learn you about validation. But the spoken language is not that great and the steps are way to quick to do this in practice yourself. The help is also a bit shallow when doing the actual tasks. It's a good course if you want to learn about it and have a case as an example, not great if you want to simultaneously validate your own startup.",3
101737,"This is a great course! It definitely helped me in framing my startup idea. I would personally suggest starting even *before* building an MVP to gauge initial interest: Time is your most valuable resource - don’t spend any more than necessary on something that you don’t even know is actually viable. Another point I would make is to not mistake your friends & family for your target audience - sometimes there may of course be overlaps, but a “yeah, that sounds cool” from your friends & family doesn’t cut it. There's something called “Interviewer bias”, which means that your friends will rate your ideas more favorably than the general public. I've personally used http://www.ideacheck.io to get an initial sense of whether my ideas might actually be valuable. They take care of generating a questionnaire from the idea and put it to a panel of users from your target group. So far, the response to my ideas was mostly negative, but I've gained valuable feedback through this process.",5
101738,With the weekly assignments from this course I've validated and created my first online business based on the Lean Startup methodology.I've also learned how to properly use the Business Model Canvas to support the fast-changing environment of an startup.The most prominent aspect of this course are the action-oriented assignments that enables you to evaluate what you've learned throughout every one of the 6 weeks.,5
101739,"I am loving it so far.My only concerns are about the platform, would love to have a help chat or somebody who I can talk to.",5
101740,"Goes great with:* Business Model Canvas: A Tool for Entrepreneurs and Innovators (Project-Centered Course), University System of Georgia* From Idea to Startup, Technion - Israel Institute of Technology",5
101741,This is a an extremely helpful course. Just having an idea and how to actually step by step execute it was very well taught and having to do each assignment on your own and experiencing it was a great learning as well.,4
101742,THANK YOU!,3
101743,Really helpful and straight-forward,5
101744,Very detail references!! thumbThe course has short but brief explanation.,5

101748,More than excellent actually. No word for my rating,5
101749,Wonderful course,5
101750,Really good stuff. I learned about different useful tools that I had only heard of but understood the concept. I recommend this course.,5
101751,"The course content and all assignments can be looked though in one day. Everything really useful will appear in the MOOC 2 and on, as different tools will be given.",4
101752,Vision now updated with magnificent science which i hope to be useful for my society.,5
101753,Outstanding course deliverance. Very simple too,5
101754,This was my first Coursera course and I liked it so much I enrolled in the next one.,5
101755,"I learned so much in this course and it was very enjoyable and interactive, after I started attending the sessions. I got more active in my social media space and started to think hard about what I wanted to do with it than fun. I want to use this as a platform to earn a living and work as a consultant . this is truly my journey to accomplishing that dream. so delighted! and excited about this journey",5
101756,Great course!!,5
101757,Excellent course with logically organised content clearly presented to the student. Quizzes and assignments were fair and easy to understand and at the completion of this course I feel that I have a better understanding of social media marketing and a few new tools and skills to execute a plan in a more productive way.,5

101764,Great!,5
101765,"It was probably one of the best MOOC's I've ever attended! Sir Randy did a great job explaining everything, accompanied by excellent slides which made me understand the course more! Excellent course!",5
101766,"It's a very basic introductory course. You can't actually expect much from this anyway. You really need to take the full course to evaluate if this is a great one. I did have learned something new but I'm not yet sure if it's useful or not. Guest speakers invited to this course do share some valuable ideas. For the main instructor, he's speaking really slow which can make you feel bored. However, it's reasonable when there is a big and varied audience on coursera because not everyone can hear a quick speech. I'm going to continue studying the course.",3
101767,"Really just an intro, but seems like a good one. I feel prepared to dive to the next level.",4
101768,Brilliant introduction to social media based marketing and modern marketing in general. Engaging lectures and presentations as well as varied and enlightening reading. Would really recommend and cannot wait to start MOOC 2.,5
101769,I enjoyed it really,4
101770,"The content of this course was pitched well for a beginner in social media and marketing and provided a great overview of what to expect from the rest of the specialisation. The resources were varied and interesting, and came in a variety of formats to be accessible to as many students as possible. The quizzes were well-set-up. Some of the wording of the assignment was difficult to understand (and this from a native English speaker), and the range of answers I reviewed for my peers reflected that this was not just the case for me. It was fascinating reading what others were using social media and digital marketing strategies to leverage - the variety of industries and subsectors represented in the cohort was amazing!",4
101771,"Excellent introduction, with good speakers and slides.",4
101772,"I think that MOOC 1 offers an excellent framework for Social, even for those who are rather new to the concept of using it as a tool, whether for personal or corporate branding. Also, it's a good set up for the succeeding MOOCs where students are taken deeper into the realm of social.",5
101773,This was very educational.,5
101774,This Course is excellent and especially Prof Randy had put in a lot of effort to give this amazing series of Mooc on Social marketing. I highly recommend these Moocs,5
101775,"Very clear introduction describing the different layers of the Social Pyramid . Starting at the top with Social Networks with their shallow discussions of everything to the bottom layers of though leaders & virtual communities with their focused discussions of specific topics and their ""Passion"" or ""Trigger events"" main focus.",4

101777,I love this course and this course has motivated me to achieve more in the coming years ahead. I will take up the entire course.,5
101778,Terrific course. Very useful.,5
101779,Very interesting theory-oriented course. You are give the main tools to dig deeper into the science of digital markets in the future. Explanations are clear and concise. Recommended.,4
101780,"Fantastic, well presented class. I have really enjoyed this course so far and look forward to continuing to strengthen my social marketing skills and knowledge.",5
101781,"I would not take this class as a stand alone course, but am excited about what it may be setting up for the classes to follow. The instruction in this course was pretty basic and not difficult in the least.",4
101782,A great overview course.,5
101783,Felt somewhat light on substance.,2
101784,Great introduction in the impact of social media and how you can use it for marketing purposes.,5
101785,Great first experience for someone wanting to begin the study of social marketing.,5

101787,"Great, based on practice. A very good start",5
101788,"It's good, is the beginning to understand social media in a simple way.I learned interesting information and sites in this world of social media, however I think the should introduce you in a more personal way, give differences between taking this as persona or as company",4
101789,"This course is good, it was a bit repetive in the beginning and the most interesting content was late in the course, I would reccomend you to buy this specialization, I think next part will be even better",4
101790,Thank you!,5
101791,good introduction to social media,5
101792,I really feel privileged to be able to take these high quality course on line. They are a great help to an additional role I have been given at work (taking on marketing for a small business). Thank you for making this available and doing such high quality content and presentation.,5
101793,"I thought this course could have been more engaging. I quickly lost interest when the second course module repeated a large amount of content from the first module--I think a better overview or editing approach could have fixed that. I also was disheartened with the ""just around the corner"" sales-pitch refrain in this course ""in your next course, you'll have access to..."". It didn't help maintain my interest in the course I was taking currently.",3
101794,"This course is a great introduction to social media, you learn things that you would never imagine and they help you to understand the basis of social media, first course is more like a general idea of ""what is social?"", so in order to have a full understand of how it works you will have to take all the specialization.",5
101795,Great information. This course contains subject matter not readily available on the web.,5
101796,Very insightful and informative. I look forward to advancing with every course!,5
101797,Extremely superficial. The total content in this course would make a nice introduction segment to a full course.,2

101820,"The course is excellent and the professor Randly Hlavac´s lessons are pretty interesting and interactive. Besides, the tools he share are the best in the market. Thanks Northwestern University for the opportunity.",4
101821,"Clear, straight forward and very informative",5

101823,A good hand-on course to initiate you into the world of Social Digital Marketing.,4

101826,Thanks!,4
101827,This is a really good course for baseline level informaton,5
101828,"Great course. I would like more on how to use Hootsuite and Klout. Also which one is better?? I am finding them a challenge to use. I like to search for my own content as I find the suggested content boring...and often not relevant to what I am looking for. I can't understand why I cannot cut and past links. So, like I said a primer on how to use these sites would be good.",4
101829,"Very useful course, and I think the coming moocs will be more useful",5
101830,Very good intro to Social.,5
101831,"Great course. Looking forward completing whole specialization.Additionally, the course shares and recommends tools which are helpful if you are doing social media marketing or eager to become one.",5

101833,This course is perfect if you don't know where to begin! It really helped me understand what I didn't know and what I need to know.,5
101834,"This course was definitely introductory. I felt that most of the class just brushed over some general topics while letting us know that what he had just mentioned was going to be covered in the next MOOC. It was very helpful, however, and got me started on using the basic tools for Social Media Marketing so I'm excited to really dig in during the next courses.",4
101835,very hands on and deals with the latest social media technology both current and up and coming,5

101837,"Very basic dive into social, feels like it was structured for an older audience.",3
101838,A fantastic introduction into social networks and virtual communities! The Internet neophyte can begin with very little intimidation and come out with a larger picture on how information and content value is processed among online communities,5
101839,"I really liked this course and learned a lot, but can't help but wonder why there isn't more emphasis placed on two of today's most popular social media networking sites, Instagram and Snapchat. I would really like to learn how to better use both of these networks for marketing.",4
101840,"Very much enjoyed the course. Lots of useful information, visual, interviews with experts and up to date. Looking forward to the rest of the specialization. Great job!",5
101841,"This course opens up the world of social media to the learner. It will introduce you to the various types of social communities, how they form and what their purpose is. You will be introduced to the tools and concepts that you will use in subsequent courses in the specialization and eventually professionally as you begin to practice the skills learned.",5
101842,"The content in this course was invaluable and I learned a lot from the instructor videos, guest lectures and assignments. It's already changed the way I am doing business.My one complaint is with the grading system - and this is on Coursera and not on the course. I can't understand first why a peer graded assignment is considered late when I submitted it on time, and it's not my fault that others hadn't reviewed it yet. Similarly on a quiz, there were points given for answers that were supposed to be skipped if you had done the assignment. Therefore, the highest grade you could get on that quiz was a 57%. While passing was a 1%, it's still averaged into my final grade as a 57%. That doesn't make any sense at all.",4
101843,"Not that much techniques to learn just general course about social media,So it's not cost effective !",1
101844,I like this course very much. Valuable materials and insights.,4
101845,"Excellent course and resources. For those you don't know much about social media, it explains what it is and the importance of it. For those who use social media, it helps put everything into perspective so we can understand the important role it plays in marketing strategies.",5
101846,Great Course for introduction.,5
101847,A nice and very interesting introduction to the field of Social marketing.,5

101849,Great course! Very helpful with tons of practical tools and information to apply immediately in the real world.,5
101850,I am very happy with the Course content.After first module my understanding of using Social media for my benefit is bit improved.I am sure after Specialization i ll be able to run my business well. I am an Artist and need social/digital marketing to get noticed. Professor Randy Hlavac speech is clear and thoughtful which is very easy to follow for non native English speakers.

101861,"Engaging, well-paced and practically orientated",5

101864,Excellent introduction to the phenomenon of Social Media Marketing!,5
101865,"Not recommended for medium or advanced users. As the name says this is just an introduction in Social Media, so if you are already using it you don't have much to learn from this one. I look forward to the other courses from this Specialisation for more in depth content.",2
101866,Great course !,5
101867,Incredibly beneficial!,5
101868,I really enjoyed this module. I found it very enlightening and clear. Professor Hlavac has made a difficult subject accessible and enjoyable.,5

101874,Nice introduction to Social Media Course,5
101875,Some amazing techniques and hands on course. A must for all.,5
101876,"There are no clearly defined learning outcomes at the start of each video which are cramped with stats and facts and statements such as ""you will learn more about this in mooc 2"" and ""this will be talked about extensively in mooc 3"". As a learner its confusing to know what to take out of each video.The extend to which students are used to promote the course by prompting them to tweet about the videos is a concern. Ones or twice is okay. But every time?The assignment is a miss - students should be given a choice whether they want to focus on marketing their professional personas or marketing their business.I can summarize MOOC 1 in one sentence. Social Media is big and therefore business must change the way they do marketing.",1
101877,This course has a lot of valuable information. It's grate,5

101901,"Well organized, thoughtful, easy to follow. Useful, current content!",5
101902,"I was very impressed with this course and even though I'm already in the Social Marketing field, it gave me a new way of thinking and approaching my thoughts about social.",5
101903,"I think the content itself is somewhat too theoretical, it does not usually apply to the reality",2
101904,Instructor was good. Content of whole program was focused on analytics. Perhaps a better title for this course is Social Media Analytics.,2
101905,"The flow and content of this course is fantastic. It's engaging, thought-provoking and really keeps your interest throughout.It is evident that the course leaders have a real passion for this subject and it's an infectious trait for the learners too.",5

101907,Enjoyed the course!,5
101908,"Very basic for the cost it represents, it doesn't really provide information beyond what one could find on a simple review on the first page of Google.",1
101909,Very impressive introduction to the importance and impact of Social in our lives and in our choices. Mandatory to those who aspire to do any kind of marketing at this level.,5

101916,Very interesting!!,5
101917,very useful and a nice introductory course.,5
101918,I'm really interested in where this course is going because I want to start my own channel/business soon. Thank you for helping me out. I feel like I have a better organization as to how to pursue this profession.,5
101919,"An exhaustive introduction to the world of social! The course builds on the basic understanding of social media and platforms that one has by virtue of being part of a social network.The insights on the trends, the numbers and the evolution of the social world are indeed, very enlightening!",5
101920,"I really enjoyed this course but it really is more of an introduction to the rest of the specialisation.A lot was repeated over and over which seemed a little tedious at times but in actuality, it made sure I really understood and clearly processed the most important information.Looking forward to the next course!",4
101921,"Great course for beginners in Social Media Marketing, I found it very useful as it helps understand what actually social media are and what kind of media and trends are out there. This helped me as I could refine my business idea and start defining my social media strategy since the very beginning. It also provides know-how on tools and it helps you sign up to them so you can start right away.",5
101922,Insightful!!! Made me realised there's more on the social sphere than i thought.,5
101923,Very informative. Delivered its promise to introduce you to Social Media as well,5
101924,"The informations were useful, but the videos were repetitive. This whole course had the amount of informations as one week of many others. If it was free I would have no complaints, but since it is part of a specialization, I expect more. Removing all the fat each week would have 10 minutes worth of material.Also I did not appreciate the length at which the speakers promoted their books.",2
101925,Excellent course! It really is delightful and fun to engage in social marketing and to have help and advice in doing so!,5
101926,Great introduction to Social marketing,5
101927,This course was immensely helpful in how it connects students with resources and information that allow them to stay up-to-date on all things social. Instructor Hlavac gave us all of the information we might need in a way that was easy to digest as well as making sure we had the tools necessary to succeed in the course.,5
101928,I am only half way through this course but I am loving it! I look forward to continuing my specialization :D,5
101929,Learned so much in this class. Social is the talk of the town everywhere you go. This class will help you to be a leader in those conversations.,5

101931,such a great course!!!,5
101932,"Great introduction! I really feel like I learned a lot and am looking forward to going through with the rest of the courses in this specialization. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the peer-reviewed assignment. I felt I didn't really get enough peer feedback. Other than that, I thought everything else was great. The videos were very informative. It didn't take up a lot of my free time and I felt a sense of accomplishment when the course was completed.",5
101933,Fantastic introduction to the world of social,5
101934,Very informative in the subject material for an introductory course. I am looking forward to the next set of courses.,5
101935,"As a social media user and new to marketing in this area, this course offered a great ""get started"" overview and actionable steps to start working on a plan to reach my high value market. I would recommend this course, particularly the paid version, highly. It's worth the investment so far.",5
101936,This class was so boring I could not stand it. Social Media Marketing is such a fun + interesting subject that I could not BELIEVE they could make it so dull. Disappointed!,2

101942,"The course is very well organized, instructors are top notch! I only registered for one course, but the level of instruction was such that I signed up for the specialization.",5
101943,Strongly recommend for everyone who wants to understand social media,5
101944,"This section is great for absolute beginners, and I would highly recommend it to anyone new to social media and social marketing. It seems necessary for it to be this straightforward to set everyone up for the more advanced material. Most of this was review for me, but I learned some interesting, fun facts about social media usage and data.The project was peer graded, which normally I enjoy, however, one of my peer assessments said my assignment was missing elements that I specifically made sure to include and address. There was no way to really dispute this, so I feel like my grade on the assignment wasn't fair. That said, I didn't have a bad grade, but I put a great deal of effort into my proposal and making sure it addressed all of the necessary points.Otherwise, very informative and enjoyable, and the class participation in social media is great.",4
101945,"This course was challenging and interactive. If you use any kind of social media, promote anything is the business work or non for profit, this is the one class that is a Must.",5

101949,"Excellent information, current, videos are engaging. Great course to start the specialization.",5
101950,"A wonderful introduction into social media and how it can be used for promotional purposes. Prof Randy Hlavac is clear and insightful, the course content is engaging and interesting, and the assignments are meaningful.

101951,Exceeded my expectations! Great course and I plan on taking the rest of the courses in the Specialization.,5
101952,Very useful and informative!,5
101953,Totally new Experience .. Love it,5
101954,Great course!,5
101955,"This was an absolutely excellent course. I began implementing what I learned into my social strategy immediately, and my Klout score jumped from below 30 to 50 within a matter of days. The professor is very good at explaining everything clearly, and the other experts he brings in really add value. I can't wait for the second course!",5
101956,this course at the end was very helpful to as I didn't know a lot of sites that can help me with managing my time & also my social,5
101957,its excellent i recommend this,5
101958,Great basics and intro to following courses,5
101959,I like that this course requires you to actually do something active instead of only theory,5
101960,great introduction to social.,5
101961,Phenomenal information and terrific perspective. Coming from a total newbie aspect I feel blessed that this was the course I chose. Thank you everyone for all the hard work involved in making this course.,5
101962,The hands-on experience throughout this MOOC will teach how to effectively have an impact through social media platforms toward your target audiences.,5
101963,not easy to understand but it's a good course indeed.,5
101964,Had a great learning experience under Randy. He keeps things simple and crisp.,5
101965,Excellent!! I have learned pretty much thanks to this MOOC,5
101966,"Helped me get my head around this inescapable part of marketing strategy and justify placing it at the center of my thinking. Even as the marketing world acknowledges social as legit, there is still a tendency at the agency level and by clients (especially finanicial service client) to treat it as an add-on.",5
101967,Very good and practical.,4
101968,"insightful , gives a good brief of the use of social",4
101969,"Very good class for getting my feet wet. I have the ability to tweet, post and opine in response to blog posts but I feel that for my business I need to have an understanding of Social Media. I intend to use the tools to build my professional persona and gain larger understand of Social.Looking forward to the next MOOC.",5
101970,"very useful and clear, thanks!",5
101971,great starting point,5
101972,Great introduction for the greatness to come,5
101973,Excellent introduction to social media,5
101974,"I love this course and the instructors. I am learning so much. The only thing i would change is to make sure papers from peers are marked in a timely manner. I have marked three papers, and have not had a single person mark mine. I hope this will not affect my ability to certify for your specialty, as i am really enjoying my time here.",4
101975,Thank you for those great insights,4
101976,The content was very shallow. Not lot of hands on,2
101977,"I liked a lot the course design, but I kind of felt the need of more study cases.",4
101978,"The course is quite short (videos are usually only 3-7 minutes long) and therefore could be completed very quickly and/or need quite little time investment. I did not like that they do not have any written materials cause at some points they go over written slides very quickly and it is tricky to follow and understand. On the other hand, there is a lot of repeats and therefore you will understand everything in the end.",3
101979,Very useful and hands-on course! I learned a lot and am eager to learn more!,5
101980,I really enjoyed this First Course. I think it will help alot with my work and my own business..,5
101981,Very well developed,5
101982,"The instructor is top notch, the professionals invited are the best in their speciality. The structure and content deliver the purpose.I am honestly very excited to have found this opportunity to retool myself professionally, and open doors for a better future.",5
101983,"Loved it. I learned a lot of new information and found it helpful to be reminded of things I already had a handle on but had not kept up with. I wish I had had the opportunity to increase my final grade by being prompted to engage in more discussion boards before finishing the course. I was surprised it was over when it was over, a final review page or check list type of thing would have been nice.",5
101984,I really enjoyed this course. I look forward to learning more about Social Media in this Specialization!,5
101985,"I wished it to be more hands on, more practical but unfortunately is like reading a book about social marketing. I am disappointed...",2
101986,Access to Northwestern's faculty and participation in a course geared exactly to my needs? Brilliant. I absolutely recommend.,5
101987,"Decent coverage of the basics, but some of the data, tools and approaches used are out of date by 2-3 years which is particularly troublesome in the fast-moving social space. For example, they rely quite a bit on data from 2011 and 2012 and from social tools and reports from IBM.For someone completely new to the social space, this could be a great starter class. Just be sure to do your own research to supplement the data and be sure you're current.After grading assignments by other students, it was easy to see why the discussion portions of the class were flat: most either didn't invest in the assignments or didn't understand the materials. While I have found the discussion portions of other MOOCs to be equally interesting to the class material, I didn't have that experience in this session.",3
101988,"I enjoyed the course material and instruction, I'm looking forward to the next section. Thank you",4
101989,"I signed up for the full Social Media Marketing specialization knowing little what to expect. I am so thrilled that I did as I have learned so much already and can't wait to continue. Professor Hlavac is clearly brilliant in his field, but he is also humble, clear and encouraging. Love the class!!",5
101990,"The course offered packaged, essential social information in a way that wasn't overwhelming. I enjoyed the pace of the course as well. I would recommend this course for future students. The content was beneficial for students I will teach in the future as well.",4

101993,Amazing Course with great insight of social media,5
101994,"This is an excellent course to help gain the basics of social. The course is specific, fast-paced, and designed for learners of all types. GREAT job!",5
101995,I love the insights.,5
101996,"It is very interesting but realy an overview. It seems that the main information is on the next moocs of the specialization. If you are looking for a standalone introduction to marketing, I would recommend searching for another course.",4
101997,Great course with insights on the Social Media Landscape,5
101998,"It was a little short, but packed with good and practical info!",4

102011,very informational and explained well. easy for the laymen to understand,5
102012,"Very interesting course, with many description but not enough examples that why I give only 4 stars not 5.",4
102013,This was an amazing course that gives you a great basic understanding on Social Media. It will change the way you think you know Social. I truly recommend it. =D,5
102014,"Nice Course, though felt more like precursor to the other courses in the Specialization though.Lot of great advice and tips.",4
102015,I definitely learned some things but some of the videos focused a fair amount on what we will be doing in the future rather than providing information now.,4
102016,"What is Social? It is a modern, dynamic course with relevant information about social media. I have no experience in handling social media strategies but this course inspires me to follow all its recommendations to venture into the management of social networks and create my own brand or work alongside a creative team in social media. Thanks to Instructor Randy Hlavac of Northwestern University.",5
102017,Thank you very much for providing the access to this amazing course on Social topic. It helps a lot in enhancing the understanding of the definition of social and also provides multiple cool way to promote social skills. What I appreciate even more is that there are a bunch of tool kits introduced in this course.,5
102018,very practical. While also providing an academic explanation of new marketing concepts,5
102019,"It was amazing the way that the theme was approached, specially because I have some difficulties about the subject, but could learn and interact easily. Thanks you all who made that possible.",5
102020,"Nice course, but too many unnecessary words around the necessary core of the course. And I don't want to Tweet all that Tweets.",4
102021,"Excellent, well presented course with a lot of interesting material perfect fit for online learning.",5
102022,Really interesting,4
102023,"I am new to social media and using social media for business purposes. Seems timely, has me actually doing social media activities, and has focused on a goal of my choice. It seems to be quite useful, and I will be taking the next modules.",5
102024,"Very eye opening for me in a market I have no idea about, Very friendly and helpful professor along with the members that have helped him out!",5
102025,Very interesting and great way to learn the basics of marketing of the new ear.,4
102026,"Very informative course. I love the way the course has balanced theoretical knowledge and practical application of the same. Happy to make the decision to join this course. Thanks Prof. Randy Hlavac, Northwestern University Team & Coursera",5
102027,Very insightful starting point to Social Media Marketing. Looking forward to MOOC 2,5
102028,Very interesting class with a lots of learning regarding the change of social media nowadays.,4
102029,"This is a great course for novices, but even as someone with a couple of years of experience managing social media, there are still gems in this course. There are some amazing statistics about the importance of social media (very helpful for anyone that needs to demonstrate how critical it is for your organization) and I also loved the class assignment and thought that it was very practical.",4
102030,"Loved this course. It provided a wonderful framework for thinking about the social media landscape. I found it had just the right combination of videos, slides and articles to keep me engaged. Thank you!",5
102031,"Great introductory course, can't wait for the next!",5
102032,"I really loved this course for three reasons: (1) It was clearly designed for an online audience (as opposed to a recording of a University lecture); (2) it offered good, relevant, clearly-presented information in a concise way, including guest lectures by topical experts; and (3) it was relevant and useful to my current business needs. It met and possibly exceeded my expectations. I was able to glean helpful information and sources without being overwhelming in terms of time expenditure.",5
102033,the professor was a little bit dry and repetitive but otherwise the content was interesting!,3
102034,Very good basic overview of social and how it impacts all businesses.,4
102035,"An okay introduction to the specialization; hopefully, the future courses will get into more detail.",3
102036,Very strong course.,5
102037,I really enjoyed this course it was very informative.,5
102038,"I would like more content from this module. It was very slow to take off, especially week one. It was easy and enjoyable though. I would have liked it to be more challenging.",3
102039,"I was surprised by this class.I knew the capstone was the development of the persona for the entire specialization but the final assignment blind sided me.*I am not ready to create that much metrics because this is an actual company being launched, and the costs of this musr be counted thoroughly. I can't just toss the accounts away at the end. All I all, I loved the course.*I stand somewhat corrected. Turns out I was blindsided due to inadvertently skipping over second, peer focused assignment in wk 3. Once i caught that(whilst waiting for notification of completion), the trepidation faded somewhat.",5
102040,Really enjoying this mooc so far,4
102041,Great Course,5
102042,Great introduction of social marketing,5
102043,I enjoyed this course look forward to learning more.,5
102044,It was awesome! It gave me great insight into the social pyramid and how relevant virtual communitiesare to a social strategy and the social success of your brand! Looking forward to the MOOC 2,5
102045,The course communicates very clearly its intent to help students build marketable business skills and they do not under-perform. It also stimulated me to stay with the multi-course program which is something that I had not seen in other MOOCs.,5
102046,Awesome course. Exams could have been a little tough to pass....,4
102047,The course is extremely well structured. They are doing a great job of making the course useful by creating real life assignments and ensuring users implement learning in the real world,5
102048,"Great for catching up with new trend. Knowledge is organized, well analyzed and useful.",5
102049,"Good introduction. But it feels like it is not complete. It is not much without the other courses so you either take the entire specialization or the benefits are not that big :(I feel like the specialization courses are an artificial break to a real university class... if the university class had only the content from those videos, that would not be enough.",3
102050,"this is very basic and clear about social. it helps me understand about the fielf of social marketing, some concepts, such as social network, virtual community and characteristics of these are essential for making social plan.the exercise seems easy but practical, it is good first step for leaning social marketing. hope to learn next course",4
102051,simply super.,5
102052,"The course offers a good insight on social media. However, there are constant references to what will be done on the next MOOCS of the specialization, which gives the sensation that they're advertising themselves, and you are only listening to a mild introduction.",4
102053,The course is simple and perfectly self contained. It is excellent as a primer on the topic or to refresh old knowledge. The examples are clear and so is the language. Of course it does not address in full the complexity and the ramifications of this approach.,5
102054,too many grading errors.,1
102055,"Very basic content, the content in this 5-week course accounts for similar volume as only one week in courses from other universities.",2
102056,"love it, nicely presented and useful",5
102057,A little simple but a good way to kick off the SEO course,4
102058,"Great course for beginners. If you have some experience in SEO and content marketing, you can pass it quickly, but still get valuable insights.",5
102059,"This course is pretty old considering how fast this field changes,",2
102060,Really good course. Helped me build a foundational understanding of SEO.,5

102063,"Great course, great resources!",5
102064,"The teacher provides a thorough explanation of the SE landscape. If you are just getting started in SEO, you should take this course.",5
102065,A really good course for having more knowledge about SEO,4
102066,A great introduction to SEO and world of digital marketing!,5
102067,A great course for someone who has no idea about what is SEO and how it works. The course just covers the basics but it can serve as a good foundation stone!,5
102068,"I've really enjoyed this course! I have learn a lot of things in the field of SEO that I didn't know at all. And for the first course of the specialization, I think it is already a lot. So, I guess that the whole will be very practical and proper to make me become a real SEO. Really eager to continue !",5
102069,"It´s a good point os start, but it is focused on theory and history of SEO, it needs more practice information.",4
102070,Good overview! Especially week 3 contains great information.,4
102071,I really liked it and hope I would get the chance to finish the rest of it!,5
102072,Course lacks real example and full of theory. It lacks steps of what actually needs to be done to achieve SEO.,2
102073,"One can understand concepts and fundamentals of SEO very easily, Very well taught by the instructor.",5
102074,Thank you,5
102075,great basic understanding (mostly theoretical stuff),4
102076,need to be more advanced even for a beginner.,3
102077,Great course!,5
102078,Great course for someone whose starting out and no background of SEO whatsoever.,4
102079,A very informative course that lays out the basics of SEO really well and forms a foundation that a learner can build upon. The instructors are great! Supplementary reading material and constant references to tools and softwares available online helps a learner understand what kind of tools SEO professionals use and how they too can use them to their advantage.,5
102080,very good ! learnt a lot,5
102081,Wonderful experience and valuable knowledge about SEO gained.,5
102082,"This class was great to understand the basics - what is SEO, why SEO is needed, SEO terms and creators.",5

102088,Well explained introduction to SEO.,5
102089,A very enjoyable and informative course for anyone interested in the art of SEO.,5

102093,Very Informative and useful lectures. Explained in a very simple way.,5
102094,This was a great overview of the material,5
102095,"Very good starting point, to give you a feel of what SEO is and build the context.",5
102096,"This course is an overview of SEO and doesn't go into a lot of detail of how SEO is actually implemented on the site. What it does do is offer a snapshot of the industry as a job outlook, discuss Google's algorithm impact on SEO practitioners, offers interviews with current SEO analysts and experts, and describes how content affects SEO. I recommend taking the more practical courses in the specialization to get skills needed unless you're an absolute beginner and have no clue what SEO is.",3
102097,The introduction course was very easy. I've already started the Second course (SEO Fundamentals) and I'm learning a lot. Thanks Rebekah :),5
102098,"Nice introduction, with particular focus to Google algorithms history",4
102099,awesome course. It provides with the basic knowledge on SEO and build a strong interest in you for the course.,5
102100,"Very useful, dynamic and engaging course. Totally recommended!",5
102101,"easy to understand , up to date course materialslinks to useful content , and even career advice to become better at seo makes this course one of its kind",5
102102,"Excellent intro course ! I would've liked more focus on hands-on exercises, but it provided a great overview and foundation.",4

102104,Great course for beginner!,5
102105,Awesome instructions,5
102106,Perfect,5
102107,"This course is very clear, interesting and helpfull. It made me want to learn more about SEO. I understood the basics and had access to real life examples and other revelant materials. Even if you don't plan on working with SEO, this course is still interesting for anyone who is interested in how search engines work. Thank you so much!",5
102108,"Informative, but can get boring.",4
102109,Quite good for the beginners,4
102110,More on the history of SEO rather than tactics.,3
102111,Good course to have an idea of how search engines work and introduction to seo,5
102112,First I didn't like it but throughout the course it became more and more engaging and gave more relevant and practical information,5
102113,"This course offers good knowledge of the history and evolution of search engines, that allows you to understand nowadays solutions",4
102114,Great overview and introduction!,5
102115,This entire specialisation is the best I've taken in Coursera. Very well organised with practical and highly useful knowledge. Thank you!,5
102116,Very helpful and useful information! Would definitely recommend it (as I did!),5
102117,It was great to learn a new skill on this platform.,5
102118,More insight about SEO tactics and SEO history. The breakdown of topic into sessions were well-defined and easy-understanble for amateur like me !,4
102119,Lots of great information - much more than an introduction. Very well organized and presented.,5
102120,"The course was designed in a way to explain the very beginning of the SEO profession: how search engines developed, how the search mechanism works and what is the role of SEO specialists in improving search results. The course provided me with the basic understanding of the theme and filled with curiosity to explore the principles of site rankings further.",5
102121,I enjoyed the course and gather much more information related to history and current terms of SEO. Indeed it is good course overall.,5
102122,I injoyed this course a lot.,5
102123,best introductory course about SEO....Thank You!!!,5
102124,Excellent teaching. I learned so much,4
102125,I think it's a very useful course to those who have any kind of business (since not being online it's impossible in our days). it gives you a complete understanding of how you should promote and construct your website to conquer your targets.,5
102126,Very useful knowledge to acquire for those completely new to SEO.,5
102127,One of the most usefull courses found on Search Engine Optimization. Well developed and detailed. It covers the topics very effectively.,5
102128,Not sure how this course is usefull.,2
102129,"I found the course appealing, especially the set up of the combination of video lessons with correlating reading/video materials. Though I certainly have a lot to learn, I feel Rebekah May's lessons offered clear, focused objectives that helped me to ""get my feet wet"" in learning about SEO. If I had one request, I would love for the discussion forum to be more interactive, especially in the early stages of the course.",5
102130,good and very useful,4
102131,I consistently am amazed at how much I am learning. The material is presented well and is challenging. The assignments at this point are on real world scenarios - websites that are in existence and in need of SEO improvement. That was incredibly challenging.,5
102132,"Felt that the first week, how to get a job in SEO should be the last module. Unsure the value it has when you don't even know SEO at the level one would need in order to get a job in SEO.",3
102133,Very good course and additional resources. I think it's the first course on Coursera I really can advise to my friends.,5
102134,Great course.The instructor have done a wonderful job !,5
102135,"Course material was well sliced up to keep it relevant and interesting - nothing really dragged on. I'd suggest re-considering how long reading material takes, sometimes something like 2 articles was listed as taking 2 hours, making the overall course time seem much longer than it truly was. But the content shared was really interesting and helpful to a beginner SEO like me.",5
102136,"I definitely feel that this course offers a wealth of material with regards to the basics of SEO. Some of the quiz questions were a little confusing, but overall, I'm very pleased with the course and will be taking the other related courses to complete the specialization.",4
102137,Am really liking the course though I would rather it pick up faster.,5
102138,"Brief, but informative. Truly helped me better understand the concept of SEO, and especially algorithms.",5
102139,"Very interesting course for everyone, who wants to try themselves in SEO and learn more about it.I put 4 of 5, because I hope, that in future there will be subtitles in other languages, except English. It would be much easier in understanding for people from no English-speaking countries.Thanks a lot for new for me information and good luck!",4
102140,Found this course very informative! Thanks!,5
102141,Awsome And very Informative Course Regarding to SEP,5
102142,Good Introduction to SEO,5
102143,"This is a great course to get introduced to SEO. If you already know about it, you might find some of the lessons elementary but you'll definitely get to learn, thanks to Prof. May's great teaching style.",5
102144,Good introduction. Mainly deals with the history of search engines and gives an overview of how SEO has evolved into a complex discipline. Important updates of Google's search algorithms are discussed. The reading materials were really interesting. Beginner level course.,5
102145,"I signed up to audit the first 5 courses in this specialization. This review is for the first 3 of these courses taught by Rebekah May.I don't know that SEO is truly simple and logical or if it just appears this way because of how clear and easy to listen to Ms. May is. I do feel she has supplied a lot of very useful information, pointed to a lot of great tools and websites., and am already making improvements as a result of her classes.",5
102146,Good introduction. Thanks for the Background Information.,4
102147,Great course !,5
102148,Its a great start point with great emphasis on introductions to whats to come!,4
102149,Great for a beginner. Cleared a lot of things up and provided confidence for the next round.,5
102150,"Great Introduction. The only thing that I would change is to put the career information in the last week's module, after you have learned basic stuff about SEO - otherwise you have to think about starting a career in something that you do not know yet.",5
102151,Love the instructor!!!! Very good course for beginner !! Highly recommend !!,5
102152,Perfectly coordinated and very interesting. I definitely will take other courses in the specialisation.,5
102153,Great introduction to SEO,5
102154,It's been a very helpful course providing all the introductory knowledge on SEO. Perfect for anyone with interest in Search Engine and Online Marketing.,5

102156,"This course is perfect if you want to acquire the very bacis of SEO: its history, its evolution and today's SEO. Week 4 is definitely the one you learn even more about concrete tips to put in place as a SEO begginer (or soon expert!)",5
102157,Great course. One of the bests I've seen in Coursera in giving a deep content and trying to be clear. I would suggest a review of the texts givens. Sometimes the texts give some specific concept that wasn't discussed in previews classes. Having to search for it takes sometime. A Glossary for those would be very welcome.,5
102158,Not bad for who have never met the SEO,2
102159,Fantastic introductory course. I came into this with an understanding of marketing and a desire to learn about SEO. I now feel that i have a grasp on the fundamentals and history of SEO that will prove relevant in a future marketing career. Thanks for the class!,5
102160,"Content is good. But you need to pay to be able to answer quiz. In other courses of that specialization track you even need to pay to do peer assessments. It is a shame that education and securing the learn success seems not to be the focus anymore - it seems that focus turned towards monetization.So before taking the course be aware that you can not get a participation rate of 100% due to locked quizzes, which will only be unlocked once you paid.",2
102161,Nice course for beginners.,5
102162,"Very informative, however a bit too detailed on the history of previous search engines and past Google updates. Could've done with a bit less history and more up to date information.",3
102163,Thank you. It was awesome!,5
102164,"The course was awesome.. Truly, I have learned about the introduction of the web and the birth of search engines, followed by their progression and development through out the modern era. Thanks to the Team.",4
102165,Thank you so much for providing me this platform,5
102166,This course really opened a lot of new possibilities for me. I now understand better how I can reach my target audience and share information that I know will help people using SEO. I hope that this course will reach more people looking for a skill that is very indispensable in this ever growing online based generation. Thank you very much for the opportunity of learning from experts.,5
102167,"Almost nothing relevant to start working, but fine.",3
102168,Excellent! Highly recommended,5
102169,"Fantastic Introductory course, ideal for beginners. Very concise and easy to understand with each section brooken down into small chunks. Regular progression and knowledge check in order to ascertain understanding of the course.",5
102170,Amazing Course !,5
102171,"If you have time, it is a good course to start to understand how SEO works. If (like me) you work and don't have time, it can be a little too much useless especially in some parts of it.",4
102172,Very insightful Well taught Easy to understand though not so easy stuff Looking forward to learning more Believe it's moved in a much better direction,5
102173,a very good start to so,5
102174,Excellent introduction to SEO,5
102175,Excellent Course. made my basics and know-about of SEO really really strong. I never knew SEO very well until I did not take this course.,5
102176,"A good course having history, evolution, and career search in SEO.",4
102177,"It provides a broad overview, but materials are not very refined and the course does not provide a good structured approach to the subject. At least it did not for me, leaving me wondering as to what next steps could be if I wanted to explore further.",1
102178,Very good kick off,5
102179,Good intro to the topic. I suggest reading the suggested books and blogs to fully appreciate it.,4
102180,Very well laid out course material and instructor is awesome ! Thanks for putting this course.,4
102181,"The course is excellent in many ways. The course material,video is very simple and understandable to a layman also. one need not be an expert.The presentation was superb, leaving no doubt at the end of each week.The course material and video is self sufficient. I am very happy to have joined the course. I would like to complete the rest of the course satisfactorily. I would love to have soft copies of the material which can be downloaded for study at convenient. Thank you, madam",5
102182,This is a great course to gain a deep understanding of the nature of SEO.,5
102183,A good course and helps in better understanding of SEO.Great for beginners.,4
102184,"Very good introductory Course. Although SEO is a practical subject, it is important the strong theory and practical fundaments that this Course teaches to the learners. Thanks Rebekah.",5
102185,Content is good but there is no practice whatsoever. So much theory can become boring at times.,3
102186,"Such a great introduction and fundaments of SEO, it really worth it!",5
102187,Absolutely must-take course if you want to understand SEO fundamentally.,5
102188,Very solid and clear for an introduction!,5

102191,"It started slowly for someone who already put some effort into learning things about SEO.Starting from week 2, it was great and gave a good overview of the topic.",4
102192,Really To the point and easy to understand. Very good teaching faculty.,4
102193,Very interesting and well taught!,5
102194,Perhaps a bit too basic (and thus boring). But holding out hope it'll prove to be a good foundation for the rest of the specialization,3
102195,I enjoyed this course and feel like I've learned a lot about the history of SEO. Ms. May did a great job with the presentations and her explanations were clear and concise. I found myself bookmarking and saving many of the links she shared as resources.,4
102196,Great information in the simplest way. This is an art to master this skill & I must say that our instructor is adept at it. Thanks for this wonderful course.,5
102197,"Great course, very informative!! I can tell the classes are starting to be structured differently though. Not too much meat to this first course... reserving my opinion, until I go through a few more.",5
102198,This course made me realise how exciting SEO can be. I really like the fact that the course content is update with the latest technologies out there. I am also enjoying the SEO blog references and the reading material provided. Thank you for this enjoyable and fruitful experience!,5
102199,I really liked the structure and the content of this course but I didn't like the assignment questions. The questions went into too much detail instead of questions about understanding the topic. All in all it's a great course for people who want to get into SEO!,4
102200,Very useful. Touches upon relevant topics to give complete overview.,5
102201,it is too good ..,5
102202,Outstanding delivery - very engaging - amazing how much I learned in such a short time all while sitting at my desk during lunch hours,5
102203,"The course focused too much on careers in SEO, and the required personality traits. SEO is part of many other career streams, so spending 1/2 of the course on SEO as a career was a complete waste of time for me. Did enjoy the historical walk-through of the GA algorithm, and the point to refocus on. Thanks",4
102204,"Excellent introductory course. Gives an excellent idea about SEO career opportunity, history and future of search and a great a introduction to organic search optimization. The discussion on Google Algorithms are also fantastic. I really enjoyed this course.",5
102205,Good overview to get started. The part on SEO as a profession is far too long. Otherwise an exccellent course.,4
102206,"Great course, but it's a shame that there is no ""your question"" section after every topic, so that we could ask if something is not clear completely. Apart from that, I really enjoyed it and will keep on studying from related courses.",5
102207,very nice and practical course,4
102208,Very informative on the history of Seo.,4
102209,Amazing intro to the course,5
102210,A great fundamental breakdown of SEO strategies that you need to know in order to further understand the field. Very well designed course that is perfect for someone who is new to the field of SEO!,5
102211,"Really useful to understand SEO from pass, present to future",5
102212,"Remarkable. Very understandable, good explained with a lot of additional readings that are important, covered all the topics related to the history of search engines, programs etc. Can't wait to get to part 2 of this SEO course. Thank you!",5
102213,Very good introduction to the SEO industry. It either gets you interested or not.,4
102214,"Good information presented, but I can't get past the outdated teaching method of using the first 45 to 60 seconds of each video to talk about what the video is going to cover, then spending 30 seconds repeating those bullet points at the end of each video. Some videos are 4 minutes long, so more than half of the content is not actually content, it is essentially the instructor reading the outline for the upcoming content. It's a waste of both instructor and learner time. There are errors in the materials, and since there is no instructor feedback/interaction, there is no way to find out what was meant (including in reading assignments). All you can do is submit a ticket to get it fixed and hope that it gets corrected for the next people who take this course.",3
102215,It was a pleasure to be a participant of Introduction to Search Engine Optimization.,5
102216,Great content for someone who has no idea what SEO is and who is willing to dig deep after some basic info.,5
102217,"If you are a beginner and want to learn SEO, this is the place to start. Great course!",5
102218,"Worth all the effort. Meticulously scripted to guide you through the complexities of SEO, with gentle repetition and some tough assessments that required me to go back over parts of the module until I understood it. A good system of multiple-choice questions and peer review as assessment.",5
102219,"Amazing course for beginners ,thank you :)",5
102220,This course has provided me a deep understanding of SEO optimization and choosing a career in SEO.,5
102221,"A course offering the possibility to start practicing from the third week has providede me with a deep sense of purpose and increased my overall expectations of the Specialization.Having professor Rebekah May is also a blessing. She has been in the industry for about 8 years (I don't remember the precise amount of time) and that provides the subjects with a deeper insight from her personal experience. A Specialization to complete, thank you Coursera.",5
102222,Well structured and presented. Thank you,5
102223,"My search for a ""good understanding of SEO process"" was over after this course..! Now I'm raring to get more.. thanks!",4
102224,Good Introduction!,5
102225,Very thorough introduction to SEO.,5
102226,"after watching so many videos like ""how i got started on seo"" ""how to find a job as seo"" ""how to answer in an interview for SEO jobs"" I've realized this course really needs to focus on what people wants to hear. We want to learn SEO not how someone got started on seo!",1
102227,"Decent introduction to SEO field. Low level, introductory course.",4

102255,A good course with a lot of information and valuable insight!,4
102256,Student should be able to see results of test ( at least quiz 1 and 2) before we decide to purchase. Overall the course was easy to understand and follow. I look forward to taking to others in the series.,3
102257,"I recommend this course to the immature SEO learners. It helps to establish a fundamental understanding of how SEO has evolved over the past decade.

102260,Clear but a bit superficial. Hope the rest of the course will flesh out in more detail the various topics.,3

102262,very nice beginner level course and gives you a lot of knowledge,4
102263,"An evaluation is always tied to the value it provides in relation to the paid price.On the plus side:1) It provides an interesting historical perspective of Search Engines, their evolution and the evolution of the algorithms and their purposes.2) Rebeka May talks slowly and clearly. The transcripts also help in reviewing the contents of each lesson.On the minus side:1) It is very theoretical and with no practical application.2) Lots of terminology pops out of the blue without any prior explanation, and would be difficult to understand for a total newbie. Just as a very simple example, backlinks are mentioned several times. What is a "" backlink"" ?? I know what they are, but not everybody does.3) There should be real support material, not merely "" transcripts""4) The Peer review does not make any sense. There should be a real test. The peers do not have a ""higher"" knowledge level to make an evaluation of the alummni.5) It is not possible to take the quizzes unless you "" upgrade"" . Presently this costs $ 80.Conclusion: it is an interesting course, but at $ 80 provides no value.Audit the course instead. UC Davies and Coursera should provide this course free of charge or with a voluntary ""donation""",2

It really helped give a concise and clear overview of what initially appears to be a large and sprawling field. I just wanted to express my gratitude for the lessons. Thank you!",5
102273,This is a wonderful Course to understand the Basics of SEO. A person who don't know anything about SEO can learn many things. (Not recommended for those who have good understanding of SEO Basics before),4
102274,"Good intro to SEO. I felt like there was a lot, if not too much, time spent on the history of SEO and search engines, but otherwise, it was a well-structured course.",5
102275,Course Academy and historic,1
102276,"Weeks 2-4 contained good information about how Google searches for websites, and a quick outline of how Google's algorithms calculate which sites get ranked. Week 1 was out of place, and a poor introduction to the rest of the material.",4

102294,"I failed to figure out how to translate the theory (presented in the lectures) into practice (the only assignment, a website audit). I would have benefited from another application assignment that was a stepping stone to the full-blown audit. Information was interesting, but not sure this is a good course for someone new to the nitty gritty of SEO.",2
102295,Excellent course to have a head start. Instructor is great and the course is well designed.,5
102296,Good course,4

102315,Its excellent. Topic & contents [Including suggested contents ] were too Good]I learnt a lot. Thank you!,5
102316,"I liked the course contents, especially the Google algorithm evolution and the assignment to do an SEO analysis.I felt the first week content related to the jobs in the field of SEO was a bit long and could have been shortened since many aspects were repeated in the ""consulting/agency"" and ""in-house"" roles.",4

102318,An excellent introduction to SEO.,5

102320,"This course was encouraging and well structured. Thanks a lot!!One less star, because the way lecture has been delivered could have been more conversational instead of one way. Like the way Udacity delivers.Plz don't mind :P",4
102321,Great course so far. I enjoy every lesson. Thanks,5
102322,"As a web developer, I found that I already knew about 98% of the information presented. The final 2% I could have found faster via a Google search than by watching the lectures. It was also a little strange to me that the course began with a segment on job opportunities and how to begin a career in SEO. I feel this would have made more sense after an introduction to the material.I also did not like that the free version of the course did not allow you to complete any of the assignments, as this has not been the case in my other Coursera courses. Not only were you unable to assess your comprehension of the material because of this, but also it meant receiving annoying emails and notifications that I had not completed the module. In other classes I have taken, there are additional resources and content for the paid users. As it stands, I'm really glad I did not pay for this class.I will continue to the next SEO course, because I'm hoping that it will delve more into the technical aspects of optimization, but I am not pleased with the format so far.",2
102323,Very instructive!!!!!Nice explanations and a lot to learn about SEO,5
102324,Very Informative Course.,5
102325,A very good and easy to learn course. A prefect introduction for a new guy who wants to make a career in this niche.,5
102326,Good course,3
102327,"Unfortunately, this wasn't what I expected from the course. Maybe since I didn't take specialization but I feel that this course was too theoretical. I understand the history of SEO but I'm not confident how useful it'll be in real-life/commercial sense.",1
102328,its nice introduction to SEO. its give you an insight to SEO industry.,4
102329,I am disappointed by not being able to do the assignments unless I pay for the course.,3
102330,Really good for this modern era.,5
102331,One of my best course that I want to finish it .,5
102332,The presentation of this course is top-notched.I hope the content of this course can be longer.I hope the quizzes can be more rigorous and challenging,5
102333,excellent course with a great knowledge and the instructor are very helpful,5
102334,"Seems to me the professor needs to study evolution a bit more or change his language a bit. For example, he said, ""Evolution happens for a reason."" I know what he meant- that the success of the organism is served by the results of gene mutation - but evolution is a RANDOM event. The success of an organism depends on its survival in the habitat, etc. but it does not depend on the mutation itself. The mutation confers a fighting advantage, perhaps, but it has no will of its own. There were many times the professor seems to be saying that evolution is somehow willful. I direct him to read Richard Dawkins on this subject. I had to read it twice before I got this point - we are inclined to believe that evolution is a lot like us - driven by some purpose - but, alas, no.",2
102335,This was a phenomenal course. It was very well planned out and enabled me to acquire a deep understanding of the important concepts. The assignments given helped to crystallize my own analysis of Buddhism and its relationship with modern psychology.,5
102336,"Extremely enjoyable exploration of Buddhism and current thinking in psychology. Thought provoking and challenging, whilst also entertaining.",5
102337,"This is a fantastic course for anyone interested in Buddhism and gives an entirely different perspective on anatta and sunyata. Dr.Wright has taken lot of pain and the course material (audio, video, text, web links) is excellent. The mentors in the forum are very good and did a wonderful job in moderating the discussions.",5
102338,LOVE IT!,5
102339,I have an interest in both Buddhism and Psychology so being able to undertake a course that brings both together has been very enjoyable and I feel I have gained a lot from it.,5
102340,Great work,5
102341,"Very interesting and enjoyable. There is much to contemplate in this rich dense course. I think I'll do it again and extract even more now that I've been through it once. I find the material consistent with my own practice of mindfulness meditation, and with my studies in psychology.Thank you for a wonderful and stimulating experience. I am recommending it to family and friends so we can discuss this matter in greater depth.",4
102342,Really pleased to click in the fantastic course! Worth your time!!!,5
102343,"This is a brilliant course by an amazing professor. One of my favourite courses ever.I took this course twice. And it made a huge impact on my life, without exaggeration. Since then I went a couple of times to silence retreats Prof. Wright mentions in the course, follow and learn from the teachers he talks about.Can't be more grateful for this course.",5
102344,Excellent profesor and material.,5
102345,Fantastic course for those interested in learning about buddhism and it's implications for the modern world. The lectures were fascinating. This could have an impact on our life.,5
102346,Half-way trough and loving it.,5
102347,This is extremely interesting course! It gave me a lot of issues for further study and thinking. Strongly recommended.,5
102348,It was a great experience and profound learning. I am happy to have done this wonderful course!,5
102349,"I found this course very insightful and Dr. Robert Wright explained the lessons very clearly. I learned Buddhist principles that I now see myself applying to my daily life, making me a more mindful and thoughtful person. The office hours at the end of each week's lecture were also very entertaining and insightful. Highly recommend taking this course.",5
102350,Brilliant. Perfectly balanced and brilliantly conveyed in digestible format. Enjoyed this as well being challenged by it.,5
102351,loved it.,5
102352,Wow. I'm on Week One but already so excited to watch all the lectures and learn everything. Thank you very much for such interesting and intelligible material!,5
102353,Really enjoyed the topic and the connections between Buddhism and modern psych. Lecturer has a depth of knowledge and an individual style that jumps out of the screen.,5
102354,"Superb course! Thanks, Robert. It was thought provoking.",5
102355,"One of my ALL-TIME favourite courses on Coursera. I reaped so much joy of this course. As a baby meditator, I was first captured by the interest to see the parallels between mindfulness meditation and evolutionary psychology, and I'm very happy to have seen the latest scientific findings that corroborate some of the teachings of the Buddha. Mr. Robert Wright - the professor - is smart, authentic and fun. His lectures are well-crafted and well-sequenced. I especially enjoyed going through most of the supplemental course materials which included book readings and video interviews. These were thoughtfully selected to back up Prof. Wright's hypothesis and suppositions, and the interviews were conducted by himself with various scholars both in the scientific and Buddhist realms. I totally enjoyed the office hour videos which were useful and fun. I'm saving all of the course materials- that's how good it was. Thank you, Mr. Wright. May you be happy, peaceful and liberated! :-)",5
102356,"Very good 1st course. At a time when I wanted to make sense of my life, this is a good course to take to learn on how to reflect and re-examine one's life and concepts of self and reality.",5
102357,I really enjoyed this course and got a lot of useful information out of it. Much 'food for thought' as well as fun dinner conversation. I also found it to be very useful in my personal life.,5
102358,"Excellent! A must do if you are interested in Buddhism, psychology and meditation. It made me reflect a lot about myself and about how I see and react to the world.",5
102359,"good, entertaining, useful",5
102360,"Great content, great way of sharing the content. Really gave me a different perspective on Buddhism. really amazed to see how much modern science support 2,500 year old thoughts",5
102361,Amazing course! I loved it.,5
102362,"A nice course to take on a hard subject of Mind, Moral Truth. Found it enlightening thanks all the team for bringing such a course out to the world.",4
102363,"I was born in a village in Sri Lanka, surrounded by Buddhists, Buddhist Temples and Buddhist Culture. I had learnt Buddhism from my Parents, Sunday Schools in Temples, and in Schools.",5
102364,"Excellent course, recommended for less spiritual people. Specifically the link with evolutionary psychology gives this course a more scientific approach. The non-prescriptive rationale help people to see the why, before the what. One may eventually join, or in my case partially join, the buddhist view of the world.",5
102365,I loved loved LOVED this course. It really helped me personally and aside from that is very interesting and entertaining.,5
102366,A wonderful course! I learned so much about Buddhism and meditation.,5
102367,"I am extremely happy I completed this course, it has lend me new lenses to view reality in a way I wouldn't have imagined otherwise. Thank you !",5
102368,Course is brilliantly organised and loved the way modern science has been linked to Buddhism.,5
102369,Interesting course. I would have liked to have more on meditation but otherwise it was ok.,4
102370,"This is one of the best courses I've taken. Interesting, fast paced and life changing.",5
102371,I really enjoy this course and I have learned so much!!!!. Thank you to everyone for this opportunity specially to professor R. Wright for making this course so easy to follow. Thank you,5
102372,Great lectures. I really enjoy discovering the world of the teacher and friends. I'll give it 3 stars since it doesn't arrive at an awe inspiring conclusion or life changing experience as somebody interesting into these subject would expect. The part where our own importance is challenge is enlightening. Cheers to the good professor.,3
102373,Best thing I've done for a looooong time !!!,5
102374,Excellent course. A great way to introduce to Buddhist with a scientific approach.,5
102375,I haven't finishing this course yet but the first couple of lessons are amazing!,5
102376,"beautifully explained, humorous and inspiring",5
102377,"I absolutely loved this course, I found it to be really interesting and insightful. I think the professor was excellent and explained certain concepts in a very simple and understandable manner :) highly highly recommended!",5
102378,So much information beautifully presented!,4
102379,"I'm very happy to have found this course. He has put together a sound explanation of what ulimately troubles us, the origins of those feelings, and solutions, starting with first taking a step back and understanding the big picture and then, well, in theory that shoud do it. However far teachings like this take people, I only see positives for someone, who understands the inner workings of a brain a bit better.",5
102380,Changed my life... No words... Totally and absolutly recomended it!! Thank you!!!,5
102381,This was an excellent course. I learned about the relationship between Buddhism ideas and modern psychology. I plan to use my learnings in my daily life.,5
102382,Buddhism and Modern Psychology for Buddhism,5
102383,"This is an excellent course. It's very thought-provoking and provides insight into meditation--a subject that eludes many people. The course needs more quizzes to help students learn and remember the knowledge taught in the lectures. It also needs a better evaluation scheme--the two essay-only evaluation form does not do enough to test student knowledge. Test are needed. A better evaluation scheme would weigh testing and essays, for example, 60% testing, 40% essay.",4
102384,"havnt finished yet but it is great, interesting and meaningful.i recomend to whom like psychology and buddhissm",5
102385,Great information and really learned so much. Thank you for teaching this course. I really enjoyed learning this information. I will be revisiting some modules again for a refresher or go through it again since there was so much to learn. Thank you.,5
102386,"Interesting perspective, and good tie in to modern psychology as promised.",4
102387,"I have a negative opinion of the structure of this course. It is not laid out in a format that I, a native English speaker, understood. The interviews and recorded lectures were not adequate or sufficiently rehearsed. The gentleman that drills his own cavities in his home workshop was most annoying and pointless. Looked at the ceiling Buddha 97% of his screen time.The reading was too disjointed and the book on Mindfulness is really more commercial and repetitious that one would expect of a course in Coursera. Professor Wright is too laconic, phlegmatic and unengaging. I wrote the assignment for week three but there were no instructions on how to convert a document in textedit (Mac WP) to the course submission page so that was a total crash for me. I would never recommend this course to anyone.",1
102388,"Robert Wright is if not the most eloquent person I have seen, at least one of the most. His lectures are clear and the subject is super interesting. As far as the third week videos go, I have not yet seen any statement from him that sounded presumptuous or extremely partial. The way the lessons were organized and explained, I believe, were planned for the western people that sometimes may be a little more skeptical of subjects such as Buddhism.",5
102389,"Phenomenal course! It cast a new light on Buddhism for me, which was absolutely fascinating...",5
102390,"Enlightening (no joke!) Great course, good pace - take it. You won't regret the time invested!",5
102391,"I personally believe this course should be taught in residential campuses and colleges all around the world. The course does introduce Buddhist ideas, but more importantly, it helps us realize our flaws in a Darwinian setting. It is more about Darwin and evolution than it is about Buddhism. It helps us understand why people sometimes are vicious, irrational or why we act in ways that we don't associate with us. I would recommend the course to everyone I know, and any one who is reading this: just finish the course in one small video at a time and put all of this in practice!",5
102392,"Excellent course. Thoughtfully presented, by an instructor with considerable expertise in the field of evolutionary psychology who has also spent a lot of time thinking about religions and religious experience. Wright is ideally suited to navigate the content, and his interviews with other experts in the fields (and the fields are diverse) add greatly to the learning experience. Fantastic experience overall.",5
102393,Wonderful course where you can really and honestly evaluate yourself !,5
102394,The content is great but it would be great to have a booklet or something writing in addition because the teacher style is very much conversational.,4
102395,"very accurate, stimulating and never boring. Thank a lot.",5
102396,I really enjoyed this course,5
102397,"Very useful introduction to the topic! This is a course accessible for all, but at the same time it is very rich in the information supplied.",5
102398,I really enjoyed this course. The subject matter was very thought provoking or perhaps it better said that it was thought managing. Great presentation by the professor and the obvious interest that he has in the course himself came across very well.,5
102399,Very enlightening and thought-provoking!,5
102400,Great course - a starting point for exploring both Buddhism and Modern Psychology!,5
102401,"Excellent course, carefully and thoughtfully planned and released in an academic and yet relaxed, inspiring way.",5
102402,I love this course! Every lecture I feel like I have learned a new bit of info.,5
102403,Congratulation to Robert Wright for his kind and human approach and for helping us to become better people through,5
102404,I highly recommend this very insightfcourse,5
102405,It was a brilliant course. we get to learn so much to improve ourselves. i enjoyed it. :),4
102406,Thank u so much....,4
102407,Extremely good.,5
102408,"Fascinating course, makes this topic accessible, and loved the dog cameos in the office hours. Thank you.",5
102409,"I got a lot out of this course. While the curriculum was by necessity very condensed, I thought that Dr. Wright did an impressive job of organizing the progression of concepts and including key information. The interviews he conducted with guest speakers in each of the lectures were helpful, and relevant to the topics being discussed. I also appreciated the supplementary reading materials included with each week's lesson. Most of all, I enjoyed Dr. Wright, who has a very relaxed, common sensical approach to what he's discussing. I would recommend this class to anyone who has interest in the topic and also to anyone who wants to learn from a very knowledgeable and effective teacher.",5
102410,"The content of the course is accessible for those newer to the study of Buddhism or psychology, at the same time offering new and intriguing ideas and resources for folks like myself who have some experience in both studies. Dr. Wright does a brilliant job of guiding the student through the materials using interview videos with experts from across disciplines. If any changes were to be made to this course, I would suggest incorporating other kinds of videos and adding a reference list of all the research referenced during the course (providing the research would be especially awesome - the Science of Happiness course does a brilliant job of this). Many thanks for the opportunity to learn from and dialogue with Dr. Wright and all his accomplished and interesting guests.",5
102411,"Awesome course given by a very charismatic instructor, with the curious participation of his 2 furred sidekicks. The contents of this course are very useful for our everyday life, by helping us increase our awareness of mental processess. Also very useful for people who are willing to start meditating and improving welfare.",5
102412,"Wanted to know Buddhism, how is it different from Hinduism. Thank you for the course.",4
102413,"Recommended, ver interesting and professor Wright and his dogs are awesome!",5
102414,"I thoroughly enjoyed this course. I've always been curious about Buddhism and didn't really know what to expect. I'm a science nerd, so this fit right in. The course does a good job at pivoting back and forth between science and spirituality and then tying them back together. I can't wait to learn more-- this feels like just the beginning. Thanks to Dr. Wright for putting this info out there so concisely. It is much appreciated.",5
102415,"The beginning is well prepared, interesting and informative, the end is undercooked, subjective and repetitive. Be it 2 separate courses, I would rate them 5 and 2.",3
102416,"Very interesting topic and material (I especially liked the results presented from Psychology research)! The teaching is very good with good pacing and clear presentation of the material (I also liked Prof. Wright's somewhat dry sense of humor, personally).The load is a bit demanding for a working person if you insist on doing all the extra reading and viewing the extra material (which I did anyway, because it was interesting and I am stubborn :) ) but it's only 6 weeks so you can pull through it, or just stay with the core.I got out of this course with many interesting ideas to think about, and with 2 books I from which I read some chapters that I would very much like to go on and read completely.",5
102417,I think the content is awesome. It could be a little faster and more objective.,4
102418,It was such an amazing experience!!! Thank you infinitely!,5
102419,This is very well structured course interesting and easy to follow.,5
102420,"This course lends scientific support to Buddha's views about human mind, self, meditation, and builds a helpful connection between Buddhism and evolutionary psychology. It expands my knowledge of both Buddhism and psychology. Thanks to Mr Wright's efforts in preparing and sharing this course around the world and his great insights and teaching.",5
102421,Very inspiring teaching!,5
102422,I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in Eastern Religions and Buddhism. It was a clear and easy to follow course overall.,5
102423,This course allows to develop an insight and open your mind's capacity to comprehend the unimaginable and focus on the most simple concepts that is mostly overlooked but creates an extraordinary potential that can slide through beyond limits.,5
102424,It is a well presented course. I am learning a lot. Thank you!,5
102425,I would recommend this course to everyone who is interested in Buddhism and Psychology,5
102426,"Interesting course, I recommand it to everyone who wants to learn more about buddhism or juste everyday's life psychology",5
102427,thoroughly enjoying the sessions! thank you so much for putting such a wonderful and meaningful course together.. looking forward to the assignments :),5
102428,"Informative, realistic, down to earth. Greatly enjoyed this course.",5
102429,Great Course,5
102430,A perfect scientific analysis of buddhist philosophy. It truly awakes your mind and the way you see the world.,5
102431,spiritual food!,4
102432,great and good prepearedenjoing it,5
102433,"An interesting, open minded, and provocative course. Highly recommended!",5
102434,Insightful and well structured. A few more videos of experiments and theories besides Robert Wrights would be a good idea. Overall makes you think of the different perspectives available in this world.,4
102435,It got a little confusing towards the end; I wish Robert took a little more time on those topics.,4
102436,Great class with great inspiration!,5
102437,"It is a very interesting topic for me. Dr Wright's teaching are also great for us the learn the basic knowledge about both Buddhism and modern psychology, though the topic itself are very difficult because Buddhism is far more profound than we can expect and modern psychology are still very young.",5
102438,"I was attracted to this course because it offered the science behind Buddhism and I am studying neuro-science. I have abandoned it as it is yet an other exposition of Buddhism. Neglible science, neglible evidence - just stuff I already knew from non-scientific Buddhist sources.",2
102439,"The course makes parallels between the main Buddhist concepts and current science and psychology views. Many reading materials and extra videos and sources are provided. Prof Wright is clear, clever and humorous. Excellent course.",5
102440,Outstanding course. I had been meditating for a year prior to taking this course and was just beginning to see the long-term benefits of the practice. I am not a spiritual person. My interest in religion goes only as far as it's impact on culture and society. I have been pursuing Buddhist philosophy and practice to the extent that it has shown substantive scientific benefits. I was really getting interested in the intersecting links between Buddhist thought and practice and the underlying science behind the results when this course came along. It was everything I hoped it would be. The material was relevant and thought - provoking and Professor Wright did an amazing job with its presentation.,5
102441,Have been looking for something like this for twenty years - exploring Buddhism with a technical bent and relation to modern understandings of the mind. thank you. impressed with Robert Wright.Would have liked to see a certificate and would have been a=happy to pay for this aspect if that was the barrier.,5
102442,Professor Wright was great! I loved this course.,5
102443,"This course has been a learning process that has strengthened myself / non- self, and I have understood the workings of my Modular mind, so now I'm taking full charge over it and with the help of mindfulness meditation, I'm already experiencing success. Thank you Prof. Robert wright and all the participating Professionals.",5
102444,Great Course,5
102445,I liked it very much. An accomplishment diploma would have been ok.Thank You!!,4
102446,"Outstanding perspectives, excellent insights and an awesome professor.",5
102447,"This was a fantastic introductory course into Buddhism. The professor, Robert Wright, is well spoken and clearly explains the connection between Buddhism and modern psychology. Very enjoyable and highly recommended.",5
102448,Fantastic sauce of information and nice subtle humor.Really interesting material but kind of a depressingly sounding lecturer. Looking forward for more courses from this lecturer and more of blooming of joy in his voice in future lectures.,4
102449,Enjoy the course,4
102450,Love this course! Insightful and well presented.,5
102451,"Auditing this course helped me develop a scientific view point based on principals of evolutionary psychology and enriched my understanding of Buddhist philosophy. And, I should add that taking this course helped me find my next academic challenge, which is pushing a masters in psychology. Thank you professor Wright.",5
102452,"During my 29 years of career, I have rarely had time to develop myself in the subjects that I wished but were unrelated to my profession. This course was fascinating for me now that I have just retired and am on a journey to do the things that I love. Mr Robert Wright has presented the material in a very organised and interesting way. There is a lot of food for thought. I definitely will sign up for any course that is to follow.",5
102453,"Highly Recommended, very solid and interesting, surprisingly fun too. For me the most surprising was to find that evolutionary psychology establishes mind modules, as specific biologic functionality that helped us survive ages ago, and still forms the basis for our very perceptions, emotions, speech and actions.Very nice to see biology science connected to basic Buddhistic teachings.Very sympathetic and relevant interviews with researches and practitioners.",5
102454,Very inspiring and informative course on evolutionary psychology and Buddhism. It really improved my vision. I'm grateful for all who made it possible for this course to be online.,5
102455,"Amazing teacher, very charismatic, good examples, easy to understand. Congratulations for putting together this lovely course!",5
102456,"This course was great as an introduction to Buddhism and the basics of psychology behind it. It can definately be refined, but I deeply enjoyed it. I can say it changed the way I use my mind.",4
102457,"Fantastic course: deep and insightful. Professor Goto-Jones is a wonderful and wise lecturer, I strongly recommend this course to anyone.",5
102458,"I want to say a big thank you to Prof. Wright for designing this course excellently. This course has provided an enlightening outlook on life. It's a must for not only people who are studying Buddhist philosophy but also for people who are tackling with turbulence in life & need a long term solution to dealing with life's ups & downs. Thank you Prof. Wright, I will miss you!",5
102459,Great course!,5
102460,"Overall, the course has been very satisfying and it has provided me with precious knowledge concerning not only psychology and Buddhism in particular but also religion, philosophy and the way science can creatively interact with them. The lectures were almost always very easy to follow and Dr. Wright explained all concepts in a very clear and interesting way. I would maybe decrease the length of certain video lectures though. It is totally recommendable to anyone wanting to discover new perspectives that are based on really up to date facts.",5
102461,I have learned new knowledge about the workings of the human mind. It's eye-opening. Professor Wright's lectures and after office hour lectures were all very educational. Thank you very much! :-),5
102462,"Excellent insight into human mind, would recommend!",5
102463,"Very good and quite interesting, with not a single indication of fanaticism, very well focused in science and human evolution. well done",5
102464,"Engaging and stimulating, this course offers fresh perspectives on looking at the world. With captivating video lectures backed with interviews with world-class experts on subject matters, this course is a must for those interested in the intersection of Buddhism and modern psychology. A big thank you to Mr. Wright for putting all the material together. Thank you!",5
102465,Loving it! Thank you.,5
102466,"It was a very good and well organized course, that gave me extensive information about Buddhism that was the reason to choose it. Modern psychology information nicely complements the Buddhist theme. The given literature invites me to continue deepen the topic.",5
102467,"For those interested in what Buddhism has to offer regarding the mind, but without any of the religious aspects, this is a good course both for information as well as for being thought-provoking/stimulating. The online environment enables contact with people and materials which might otherwise be beyond reach.",4
102468,Interesting introduction to Buddhism and psychology. Dr. Wright does a good job providing examples of how modern science supports Buddhist thoughts and ideas. He also invites a wide range of fascinating speakers from Buddhist monks to psychologists to weigh in on the subject. The quiz questions and essay assignments were a bit too easy.,4
102469,Great course. Everyone interested on a scientific comprehension of buddhism and mindfulness should take it.,5
102470,Amazing!!! so much to learn! super interesting... I'm so glad I found this.,5
102471,Thank you for such interesting course. Waiting for the next lectures,5
102472,This is a wonderful course which gives you are chance to see the connection between religion and modern science.,5
102473,I enjoyed the course material and the idea behind linking Buddhist concepts with psychology; I just found some of the videos a little dry.,3
102474,"This is my second go for this course and let me tell, that this course is an excellent connection of pragmatic theories of BUDDHISM.I am practicing meditation ""Vipassna Meditation"" which is a form of very intense meditation technique thought by Lord Buddha himself, i can easily correlate every word what is being thought.Thumbs up for such an insightful course!!!",5
102475,THIS IS AN AMAZING CLASS.....LIFE CHANGING EXPERIENCE .....ITS HELP ME A LOT TO DEAL WITH MY CHILDREN GOD ONLY KNOWS CHILDREN ARE ALWAYS TESTING YOU,5
102476,Robert Wright does an excellent job presenting Buddhist ideas and putting them into context with modern psychology studies. I felt he offered a unique and scientific approach to the discourses and very much enjoyed his interviews and insights. The questions at the end of every lecture were very helpful to solidify new concepts. I look forward to digging deeper into supplemental materials.,5
102477,Just awesome!,5
102478,Great course. Professor Wright really did great job to present Buddhism with modern psychology. Thanks a lot to the professor for the invaluable resources on this field.,5
102479,"Wow, so enlightening! I recommended it to everyone I know.",5
102480,"Interesting, and more grounded than I was expecting from a class focused on meditation. Well done.",4
102481,"I loved this course, the professor is very clear at explaining and giving different points of view of the theories. Personally it was a huge help because of the situation I was in when I enrolled in the course and I think having a different view of the world and ourselves is incredibly useful and positive, This course helps attain just that so I highly recommend it for someone who wants to test a little their ideas and perceptions of the world and themselves because its not just a theoretically course because it has science and experiments that help support ideas.",5
102482,"Professor Wright did an outstanding job of presenting the fundamental principles of Buddhism and Evolutionary Psychology in a manner that a newcomer to these disciplines can understand. My greatest take away from the course will be further exploration of these ideas through the varied and rich resources he provided. My personal favorites were Bikkhu Bodhi, Judson Brewer and Joseph Goldstein.Thank you Professor Wright",5
102483,"Thank you for putting this course together. I found it is extremely useful to understand Buddhism. especially selflessness with psychology knowledge. It gives the Buddhist philosophy a scientific foundation. It also helped my mindfulness meditation journey, gave me much clearer picture on what to 'watch' during the meditation journey. I recommend this course to anyone who's interested in Buddhism, Mindfulness, and meditation.",5
102484,Life changing course... excellently executed! So so pleased I took it! Please make a follow up!,5
102485,"As a retiree, it was great to listen to college lectures again on a topic of particular interest to me. Thanks.",5
102486,Really well thought out and delivered - it tied together a number of things I hadn't linked for myself and helped with context. Just need to keep working on the meditation...,5
102487,"Video after video of lengthy lecture with little variation. It's a long content dump with just two peer-reviewed assignments. If this is the best online Princeton can do, count me out.",1
102488,Amazing course with lots of reflections and insights!,5
102489,"I am grateful to Dr Wright for bringing us this excellent course. While i was attracted by moral & mindful aspects of Buddhism, this course revealed the linkages or similarities with Modern Psychology.Thanks a lot.",5
102490,"I am enjoying the thorough ,interesting way the Course is presented.Etienne",5
102491,"interesting, but monotonous lectures.",4
102492,"Thank you for Sharing This Knowledge to everyone, I am really enjoying this course and have learned a lot already from this Material, I am really looking forward to keep learning more!",4
102493,Really enjoying this course. Thank you for offering it.,5
102494,"this course has changed my life, I have learned so much and have a new passion for evolution psychology, it has answered life long questions.",5
102495,"An interesting supplement to my Zen studies and practice. While somewhat speculative in some parts (largely due to fact that the brain's complexity makes full understanding just a little out of reach even today), the course is clearly built upon the foundations of rigorous science, thousands of years of Buddhist inquiry and common sense.",4
102496,"Thank you for the course. I don't like the absolute assumption that mankind evolved from a non human life form. Natural selection and how it is discussed in this course is allright to do, but not to make scholarly assumptions as to how mankind came to be. The professor can clearly describe natural selection processes without the assumption that human evolution from supposed beings in a very scant fossil record is a proven fact. That is the only part of the course that I did not like. The constant assumption that evolution is correct takes a lot away from this course. My concern is that this assumption is taken because there seems to be no particular Creator in the Buddhist relgious tradition. That does not mean that evolution should be given additional weight. I do not consider it a hard science such as mathematics, physics, even climate change science is far more concrete than supposed human evolutionary origins. Professors should focus upon clearly explaining that evolution is a theory. Buddhism and Pschology are more concerned with the present and consciousness and what IS...not upon weak theories like evolution. I was disappointed with the Professors consistent referrral to Natural Selection as though there is no human control over what we are doing, no moral standard the religion helps to set us apart from the animal evolutionary view of humanity. It simply is not fact, not hard science. However, what we can observe and see is hard science, including the effects of Meditation upon our brains and this is a very positive part of the course and for Buddhism.",5
102497,"I have been studying Buddhism for the last 3 years, and this course makes great associations to Evolutionary Psychology. It is enlightening.",5
102498,"This was the best class I've ever taken on Coursera. The professor is brilliant and humorous. I was sorry when it ended, and will miss it.Colleen Babington",5
102499,"This course takes a very interesting approach to compare Buddhism against modern psychology, and the professor is awesome!",5
102500,Really an amazing course and incredibly well organized.,5
102501,The Course is well designed. It takes you through the Buddhist principles and co-relates how the findings of Modern Psychology are supportive of Buddha's teachings.It has normally been held that Religion and Science cannot converge.However this Course has to a large extent been able to show that it is possible to explain the matters of conciousness and beyond in terms of modern psychology,5
102502,"This course is tought by a real professional, Mr. Wright builds a very logical structure which helps dive deeper into the subject.Thanks a lot!",5
102503,"Excellent!!Explained in a comprehensible manner for all public, very interesting!",5
102504,"I have just completed this course. This is my first attempt to understand Buddhism and have approached this with all the biases inherent in having lived my whole life as a Westerner who has spent very little time trying to understand mysticism or meditation. The abstract concepts of Buddhist thought stretched my mind greatly and at times I had to stop the video just to reflect on some concept so abstract I had to play segments of the video lecture over and over again. Dr Wright seems to labor greatly on getting his explanations as plain and straightforward as he could. He held my attention without gimmicks and if I didn't get the point the first time, the video playback format made it possible for me to go over one point or another as I needed. If you come with all the usual Western bias and baggage toward Eastern (in this case Buddhist) concept and thought and would like to learn. This is the place to start. You won't be disappointed.",5
102505,"Professor Wright tells things simply- and in a straightforward manner, even some of the more complex ideas, he explains eruditely. Prof. Wright offers many helpful resources, including third-party experts, the readings, articles, videos, and office hours in particular really help enrich the subject matter. I would recommend this course to any one who has even peripheral interest in psychology or buddhism, meditation, and the scientific implications of the practice. Thank you for offering this course!",5
102506,thank you,4
102507,Excellent material and teacher,5
102508,Very good explanations in each lectures!,5
102509,I truly adore this course. I'm an engineering student and my strict class schedule doesn't allow me to explore as I'd like. I've always been interested in Buddhism and I'm an avid meditator. This course gives me a historical and psychological framework in which to look at my practice.,5
102510,Massive insight. Brilliant.,5
102511,"As I followed the course my interest grew, because great questions arise, and the connections between Psychology and Buddhism are clear, an exiting discovery for me. Also, professor Wright is an excellent orator, so the lectures was clear and pleasant.",5
102512,"The course is extremely rich and sophisticated. I had taken it sometime back but after attending the 10 day Vipassana, I came back to take it again and it made much better sense. Prof. Wright is superlative in knowledge, neutrality of view, and of course humour. However one thing I'd recommend is that it becomes quite a challenge to follow the course after a while given (of course) the subject in hand as well as, importantly, the delivery style. I wish it had visual/ pictoral supplements or some other ideas implemented to make it penetrate better!",4
102513,"I really loved the way the course was presented. The course was stimulating and very informative. Hope to see more from Robert Wright! Thanks a lot , Sir!",5
102514,"An absolute gem! Professor really presents the right breadth and depth required whether you are new to Buddhism, experienced Buddhist practitioner or someone who just want to know the Buddhism and its correspondence with Modern psychology (or someone who just want to analyse and review validity either/or/both Buddhism and Modern psychology for themselves). Professional also makes exceptional effort to interview some of the most important names in Modern psychology and Buddhism researches to interpret scriptures and shares their empirical experiences.I must admin, the first 2 weeks was a little tedious for me as those are concepts that I am quite familiar with and that on a practical level, it was introducing fundamental Buddhism concepts, its scholastic interpretations and the importance of experiential aspect of meditation, all of those I was both familiar with (on an experiential level) and contains an academic depth that was not exactly required by me.But from week 3 onwards that's where things get SUPER interesting and fascinating. Professor start debunking different interpretations of the ""No-self"" notion taught by Buddhism's 2nd sermon. This is an aspect of Buddhism that I always had difficulty accepting its mainstream interpretation and voila - the 3 parts lecture really clears all the mist for good. Office hour provides further doubt clearing and discussions forums are active and bustling with students with all arrays of discussions!A completely random sidenote: This course provides a bonus perks for dog lover from week 2 office hours onwards... :D",5
102515,"Excellent! I thoroughly enjoyed the professor's explanations and all the guest speakers he invited to give their input. He is very dedicated and answered many questions in his office hours, with humor and genuine care. Also, Frasier and Milo are impossibly cute.",5
102516,"Interesting, challenging ànd pleasant to follow and practice.Thanks to Robert Wright for opening new worlds for me!",5
102517,"Very interesting course, really made me look at ""things"" differently. Pleasant professor, it was always a pleasure listening.",5
102518,"The professor is relateable, funny, and understandable. He explains the information thoroughly and provides a multitude of resources for deeper investigation. He approaches the topics from multiple points of views, and goes in depth in each of those views. It has been a very enjoyable experience so far.",5
102519,"I loved this course so much. It gave me personal clarity. I also find Prof. Wright's examples amusing, as he connects Buddhism and modern psychology to the mundane things in life, like donuts. :)",5
102520,"Very enlightening, I would recommend this course.",4
102521,"Illuminating very interesting connections between modern psychology and the philosophy of buddhism. The essentialist interpretation the buddhist concept of emptiness was novel to me.Very lucid and pedagogical lecturer. Sometimes it was a bit repetitive and slow, but since one can watch in 1.5x speed it didn't really bother me.",5
102522,"I think professor Wright is an effective teacher. The class introduces these concepts in a clear way. It isn't academically challenging in the sense that there are difficult assignments, but there are a couple essays that help ensure that you are understanding the content. It's a great introduction for someone who knows little about Buddhism or how it stands from a psychological standpoint.",5
102523,"Good work, crossing science and buddhism.",4
102524,Rather interesting course. And I think Robert Write is cool narrator,5
102525,Its a amazing course,5
102526,"Loved this course. It was a lot of fun. The Prof. really cares about the subject and how his students contribute to his own understanding of it. (He takes a lot of time reading students' comments and replying to them during ""office hours."") He also reaches out to experts in both psychology and Buddhism and shows you his dialogue with them. Finally, the guiding questions for the assignments are a good challenge and the instructions for structuring the paper very clear. I didn't have time to write the papers but will as soon as I've the time. Bonus: you get to meet his dogs, and they're awesome.",5
102527,"Quite interesting way of analizyng buddhism and psychology. They are definitely closer to each other than I thought. The professor is clear and in love with the subject, which is a good thing, as it's infectious: you'll start to love the lessons and devour the lectures. I'm planning on taking this course again soon.",5
102528,I found the course excellent and very well taught and led by Professor Robert Wright.,5
102529,"Professor Wright is very engaging and knowledgeable! He breaks down Buddhism in an intellectual manner that does not demean the spirituality of it, but also does not adhere to it. This makes the course both educational and easy to digest, for anyone with an aversion to spiritual matters (which you will learn in this course may be a source of suffering...). I am only on the 2nd week of lessons and can't wait to see this through to the end! In an unattached appreciative manner of course... haha. Thanks to everyone that put forth the effort to design and share this course!",5
102530,A very important subject that every person should learn sometime in his life,5
102531,"Easy to follow , real life examples",4
102532,Completely amazing! Super clear explanations and excellent contents!Should take it.,5
102533,This course was excellent. Robert Wright clearly and entertainingly covered complex and interesting material. He wove important themes throughout the course. His use of guest speakers and interviews was very helpful. His office hours were engaging and meeting his dogs was fun and instructive. I feel I really learned a great deal about Buddhism and Modern Psychology. I would definitely take another course with Professor Wright.,5
102534,Brilliant. Organised. Interesting. Thought provoking. Really enjoyed the course! Thank you,5
102535,"Prof. Wright provides students with an insightful range of knowledge which is bound to impact the way you see the world. I congratulate the professor, the teaching/research assistants, my colleagues and Coursera as a platform for making this a truly enriching experience. I registered for this course not knowing what to expect and it is revealing to see how an online class has provided me a way to see the world anew, bridging differences between the East and the West, the ancient and the modern, and the humanities and the sciences. Thank you!",5
102536,Very inspiring to understand my own religion，thanks a lot to the scientific contribution in this particular area。,4
102537,"Worst course I have ever seen on Coursera. Such a shame, as the subject is very exciting, and the 'lectures' in the first couple of weeks are a monotonous jabble.",1
102538,Interesting course. The assignments were a little bit too redundant for my taste.,5
102539,Loved the professor. Do not like essay questions.,3
102540,"Very nice course, very interesting. I really liked the professor's specific sence of humour in examples he makes. The course was a little boring because of a lot talking about things already talked and understood, lots of specifications for people who might argue or disagree, or might feel offended.",4
102541,"very thought provoking, a very useful course on mindfulness and expanding your views",5
102542,The course is fascinating. I love the subject matter and it is well presented.,5
102543,Very intereting course. I recommend to everyone.,5
102544,A waste of my time.,1
102545,Firstly I enjoyed it - it was interesting. Secondly I found it did what it said it would do - it was informative. The teaching was good. The assessments were relevant and did assess learning without being too time consuming or difficult. There was a forum which was interesting. I'd definitely do another one.,5
102546,Good info with thoughtful commentary. A+ course,5
102547,"Great course, I learned",5
102548,"This is the first Coursera course that I have taken, and I was extremely glad to have taken it. Robert Wright is a wonderful lecturer - extremely intelligent, engaging and also adds some fun to the content.Thank you Robert - I learnt a surprising amount in many unexpected areas. I am glad to have encountered you and am already beginning to seek out other material that you have produced.",5
102549,"Exceptional course! I am very grateful to Profesor Robert Wright for putting together this exquisite course - I enjoyed his interesting manner of teaching, his dedication to the course, the interview with prominent figures and his dogs :)",5
102550,i need to contact porf.ROBERT WRIGHT. please let me know the email id of the prof.,5
102551,Absolutely fantastic.,5
102552,I learn a lot about our mind from this course.,5
102553,"This course is a wonderful nexus between east and west, between science and religion, between intuition and reason and between all those dichotomies, the false ones and more! It is just a shame that discussion forum moderators have become petty tyrants given censorship powers. At least, that was how it was last time I was bothered enough to try to get this stuff. One star subtracted, but it should be more given discussion is the only way really to do philosophy. Only one will do though because I guess it is a systemic problem and that it probably doesn't affect those of you who aren't borderline trolls who imbeciles easily mistake for the bad kind.",4
102554,Very nice comparisons,5
102555,Great course by Robert Wright! A lot of interesting chapters and video conversations to follow.,5
102556,Good learning experience.,5
102557,Excellent course! I have found exactly what I was looking for: a very clear and exciting explanation of the scientific foundations of Buddhist thought. After that I am definitely continuing in both lines: meditation practice and study of the mind.,5
102558,Awesome ideas and great presentation. the lectures remain lectures but without the drowsiness commonly associated with them. :),5
102559,"Language fails in describing the Buddha's teaching of concepts such as Non-Self and the experience of deep meditation common to long-time meditators. This is even harder when you consider many learners are from the Western tradition represented by logic, rationale, science, and monotheism. Yet Professor Wright has done a brilliant job of getting the learner to understand what the Buddha taught, using language, metaphors, office hours and interviews with many scientists, scholars and monks to do so very well.More than the cerebral understanding of the content of any book I have read on Buddhism, I can honestly say I now have a far clearer understanding of the profoundness of the Buddha's teaching and why he insisted we all have to find our own way. I will even go so far as to say I now don't really see my much vaunted mind as my true self. In that sense, this is truly mind-blowing! For that, my heartfelt thanks and gratitude to Professor Wright and to his interview guests.",5
102560,Well articulated and structured.,4
102561,It is interesting.,5
102562,"I love the course, but sometimes the content is too dense and deep so some concepts are hard to grasp. =D",5
102563,Well worth the time. I am someone who has been meditating for a few years and I am practicing Psychologist and Psychotherapist. I was interested to understand how my experiences with meditation can relate to the word of modern psychology and this course was very persuasive in its approach and content.,5
102564,This course is excellent to enrich your Buddhist knowledge in relation to modern science/psychology.,5
102565,"This is a great course, gives me a brand new perspective of Buddhism!",5
102566,excellent course!! worth every second of your time.,5
102567,This lesson has cleared many of my confusions about life and true hapiness.,5
102568,"Professor Wright was incredible, learned a lot from this class in such a condensed period of time. Couldn't be happier with it.",5
102569,I loved the informations they're giving us and how the professor,4
102570,"The course is number one among all ~10 courses I've taken on Coursera platform! Bullet points:1) The material is given in a structured way and simple to understand because of every-day examples we encounter in our life.2) Outstanding audio and video quality of the lectures makes Princeton University's coursers more likely to be taken.3) The lecturer has touched a various of controversial topics (religions, Buddhism in particular) and masterfully aligned them with a modern psychology discoveries.",5
102571,This course was very interesting and well prepared. Not overwhelming but with plenty of good content.,5
102572,Very interesting topics are discussed in this course. I walked away with some new thoughts and ideas about modern science and how they compared to ancient teachings. Well worth the time.,4
102573,A superb class!,5
102574,"Thorough, intelligently skeptical while reasonably open minded.Professor Wright is phenomenally engaging and clear in his delivery and knowledge.",5

102578,very interesting course!,5
102579,Extremely inspiring!,5
102580,Loved this course so much I finished watching the lectures in Two days! Inspiring.,5
102581,"Just the kind of course that is bound to have a profound impact on my life, giving me tools for tackling the big one amongst all my issues: how to reach happiness. I am very thankful to have such a learned professor willing to share this.",5
102582,it is helpful and useful. I can learn something new about western Buddhism. Thanks!,5
102583,"great course, do it again",5
102584,This course has meant a great deal to me and I hope that Prof Wright will be presenting similar courses in the future. Thank you for a most illuminating experience!,5
102585,Excelent course for understadig the bsic principles of buddhism and the logic of them.,5
102586,The course was excellent. I've become a huge Robert Wright fan.,5
102587,Amazing teacher!,5
102588,"The course goes a long way in proving what it sets out to prove. However, it would have been good to hear from some people (I am sure they exist) who dispute the stipulated thesis that modern psychology confirms that accuracy of the Buddhist analysis of the human mind.",4
102589,Really excellent course. The conversations in the additional resources at the end of each week were especially useful.,5
102590,Insightful to the point that it becomes spiritual.,5
102591,Fascinating and so helpful!,5
102592,"Great delivery, exceptional humor, enlightening. Thanks!!",5
102593,"Smile on the face of professor is missing, otherwise 5 stars.",1

102595,I would re,4
102596,Excellent!! Thanks to Coursera and Profesor Robert for provide light and knowledge. I really enjoy this course!! Thanks again...,5
102597,"Great overview of Buddhist philosophy and recent psychology research. Professor Wright invites several religious and academic figures to draw paralallels between the two in a very investigative, and curious way.I recommend watching all the interviews and taking detailed notes as they are particulary useful in doing the assignments.",5
102598,Astounding overview of life!,5
102599,Great course for those wanting to known where meditation comes from and science says about this.Professer Robert gives some excellent critical thinking on this.,5
102600,This is a brilliant course,5
102601,"Interesting, important, enlightening:)",5
102602,This is simply awesome. Professor Robert Wright has combined modern psychology and evolutionary psychology with Buddhism so seamlessly and complimentar-ily. I loved the course all along.,5
102603,"Amazing course! Never thought there would be so much to learn on the subject. The teacher is great and funny, and goes really deep in the subject. I'm impressed!",5
102604,Highly instructive. I'm glad I took this online course...,5
102605,The ideas are a little stretched but nevertheless a fun and enlightening course.,4
102606,"It is an amazing insight, although intellectually :) , and gives one the idea on what buddhism really is about. Telling the story parallel to findings of modern psychology is also a great approach. Well prepared, well told. Respect and gratitude. :)",5
102607,Very informative and interesting course.I recommend it.,5
102608,"Sir is fascinating.He has perfect explanations and examples to conduce learning.Great course structure, in the sense that it has great build up and does not let us trail off at any point.Simply wow!",5
102609,An interesting class but left me wanting more. I realize that this is an overview but the field of secular Buddhism seems very shallow. After going through this class and reading three of Steven Batchelor's books I have the distint feeling that I may have reached the end of the subject.,3
102610,"This course is absolutely fantastic, everything about it is great! Highly recomended!",5
102611,Answered many of my questions!,5
102612,"This was such an enjoyable course and has had a profound impact on my life. I now meditate and use mindfulness much more than I did. Robert Wright as a lecturer is easy to understand, patient and also adds humour to the course, with the consideration of the level of Buddhist temperament shown by his dogs during the tutorials. Time well spent. Thank you.",5
102613,"Straightforward, very well executed. I love this course!",5
102614,great teacher!,5
102615,"Kept me interested in the course, the content and lecturer were excellent",5
102616,"I enjoyed every minute of this course, including Practicing Buddhist doggies.",5
102617,A very rewarding and engaging course,5
102618,An excellent course. Highly recommended.,5
102619,Very well done! Robert Wright is a talented professor who causes one to think more about the essence of life.,5
102620,Great course! The corresponding relationship between Buddhism and science based modern Psiccology encouraged me to look further into meditating to acomplish a clearer view on life.,5
102621,"I really, really enjoyed this course. Professor Wright is thoughtful and hilarious! I would love to take more courses from",5
102622,This case is so thoughtful and informative. Really makes you think.,5
102623,"Robert Wright is analyzing buddhist thesis through the scope of modern science. The course helped me to understand better the effects of meditation and human behavior, while backing up the arguments with tons of research and latest theories of human perception and decision making. I liked also numerous guest hostings with various insights from different fields starting with monks and ending with top scientists. Highly interesting and meaningful course.",5
102624,a different point of view of modern and ancient... excellent,5
102625,I find the subject and the material fascinating. Robert is a great lecturer with an obvious wealth of knowledge on the subject to impart to his students. I am thoroughly enjoying it and I look forward to studying with Robert again in the future. It has really opened my mind to a whole new field of study.,5
102626,The Professor is excellent. I enjoyed this course solely because of Professor Wright. If you have a positive outlook on Buddhism but do not know the ins and outs of the religion/practice I do not recommend this course. I have a totally different outlook on it now that I wish I didn't have. It is interesting information but the essays are in depth and difficult...and there is no chance to even purchase a certificate.,3
102627,"Great course, exceeded my expectations by far!",5
102628,"Very inspiring and interesting course. If you want to know how human mind is, it is a MUST-Take course.",5
102629,Fantastic Course.,5
102630,"Fantastic course. The lectures are engaging, interesting and accessible, and the 2 short essays really help to integrate everything you learn. Highly recommendable!",5
102631,"Engaging content and excellent pace. While the level is introductory (I'd have liked a bit more depth), I would expect this from a lower-division/breadth course—and even more so from a MOOC like this.",5
102632,It opens a door to this beautiful way of thinking by linking it with modern science. Thank you Mr. Wright!,5
102633,Best course I have attended so far.,5
102634,very good introduction to Buddhism and psychology. I especially like the interview part.,5
102635,I am really liking this course. It's very clear and complete.,5
102636,"Buddhism and Modern Psychology course is very complete in itself, thus quite enriching for those who seek self-knowledge.",5
102637,very interesting topic and I am fond of the way how Professoer Wright teaches.,5
102638,"Being a student of Buddhism for many years, I took this course and was able to take away new information, and philosophy from it. Stepping back, and examining the basics in comparison to the modern psychological areas Professor Wright focused on, was excellent! I have already dived into his book ""The Moral Animal"" and am enjoying it very much. I will absolutely purchase and read his book on this topic as well.",5
102639,"I am almost at the end of this course and I think it is excellent. The lectures are very clear and are a great starting point if you, like me, don't really know anything about Buddhism. I really enjoyed the connection made with modern psychology; I am afraid otherwise I might have found it too vague and esoteric, but this grounded it more in every day life. I really feel this course has given me some valuable new insights with which to see the world around me and myself.",5
102640,The course changed my philosophy of life is really interesting.,5
102641,Very great insights given in this course. Thanks a lot. Great learning experience.,5
102642,It was one of the most fantastic courses I've signed up for. Very interesting way to learn some theory!,5
102643,This was my first course in Social Sciences and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Prof Wright maintains a very fine balance between philosophy and science which makes it suitable for all enthusiasts.A good course for beginners in the Buddhist enquiry.,5
102644,The Professor and the material is great!,5
102645,Terrific course and delivered by one of the most intellectual persons I have ever encountered. Fabulous course and well presented in a logical flowing detail covering the concepts and technical relationships exceptionally. Robert Wright is one of the best teachers and assembled a difficult course for delivery in a beautiful fashion. All modules excellent. The flow of the information and logic was great.,5
102646,Wonderful Course for anyone who wants to change their mind.,5
102647,Learned lot about Buddhism and modern psychology.,5
102648,"Delightfully straightforward and easy to understand presentation on Buddhism and how Buddhist ideas on self and suffering intersect with current ideas in the field of psychology, particularly evolutionary psychology. The only thing I found odd is that Robert Wright seemed to put enlightenment in the league of something unobtainable for most people.",5
102649,"Very very introductory. This course explores the Buddhist theory of suffering and liberation by comparing it to evolutionary psychological theories.It is not a deep course on Buddhism - it lacks any substantive discussion of differences between Buddhist schools, of the difficulty of reconstructing the ""historical"" Buddha (a problem as difficult as reconstructing the ""historical Christ""), of the fact that Buddhism as popularized in the West is actually quite different from any of the Asian forms of Buddhism, etc.Also, evolutionary psychology is controversial in its own right - one criticism of it is that it creates ""just-so"" stories about the origins of mental processes that are impossible to verify (or falsify). These objections are well known, but are not confronted in the course.A scholarly much sounder and deeper course is the one on Tibetan Buddhism from University of Virginia. It suffers from truly appalling presentation (the video lectures are some of the most boring I have ever watched), but the diversity of angles from which Buddhism is examined, and the depth of content are really outstanding.",1
102650,A Must!,5
102651,"It was pretty good for most of the time. I found the professor engaging and interesting. He was an effortless speaker who never seemed bored--you could tell he was passionate, but did not alienate students by using too much jargon or academe-speak. I sort of fell off of the course toward the end mostly because I felt much of the material began to repeat (or at least became extremely predictable). Overall, really great course.",4
102652,Excellent class that has also given me insights about my life and how to live life.,5
102653,This is my first philosophy course. Many concepts were introduced but they are well explained with good reference materials. I have learned a lot thanks to the teacher's dedication in building the course,5
102654,Thank you so much. This course has been very informative intellectually for my spiritual investigation.,5
102655,changed my world.,5
102656,"An amazing course for those looking to understand themselves, the world, and social interactions. This course is scientifically grounded, using the results of numerous studies to examine the human intellect and it's biases, and includes talks with various world-renowned Buddhist meditators and psychology researchers.",5
102657,Enlightening confluence of evolutionary psychology and Buddhism. I found it particularly helpfully in going further with my meditations and having a deeper understanding of the way it works.,5
102658,This was probably the most enlightening class I have ever taken.,5
102659,Great course and an introduction to evolutionary psychology!,5
102660,"I have never encountered a discussion of the first two noble truths that made so much sense to me. Having studied biology and discovered that science could not give me the answers I was seeking, I explored many different thought avenues. I am not a Buddhist, but I can identify with Buddhist thought. But what I absolutely agree with is what His Holiness the Dalai Lama says about the necessary collaboration between Buddhism and science. I think it is the only way for humanity to go to the next level and I think all spiritual and scientific directions should participate in the dialogue.I am looking forward to the rest of the course.Thank you",5
102661,I love opening my mind up to new concepts and ways of thinking. It's challenging and keeps me on my toes.,4
102662,i learned a lot from this course and helped me a lot. the course was very well structured and the instructor was very good,5
102663,"Excellent class! Thorough and humorous. The lectures and discussions included are very well explained, making difficult concepts easier to grasp. It also provides several jumping off points if you want to dive further into this combined subject of Buddhism and Modern Psychology! I look forward to exploring it further.",5
102664,"This might be the best course I've ever taken anywhere! My opinion is based on deep personal interest in meditation and psychology so might be biased, but I also actually designed my own degree of Buddhism and Psychology decades ago and have taken a great many courses and have quite a bit of experience in both subjects. I have been meditating for almost 40 years and now meditate once every four hours. Hearing someone lecture so eloquently while incorporating the input of actual meditators and his own meditation experience as well as rigorous academic and scientific discussion was an absolute delight. Also, the professor is downright charming in his office hours segments. I would give this course 10 stars if I could!",5
102665,This is a fantastic course with a fantastic premise. I look at the Buddha more as a scientist than a philosopher and hence it is very interesting for me to know similarities between Buddhist thought and psychology. Also the interviews of Buddhist monks that are intercut with the lectures are lovable!,5
102666,"This is one of the best courses I have taken so far. It is very well and intelligently structured and organized, pleasently presented (less is more, I especially liked the calm and unagitated way) and Professor Robert Write makes excellent and astonishing connections between Buddhism and Modern Psychology/Science. He presents complex matter but has the ability to break it down and to explain it in a way that makes it easy to follow. I learned a lot during this course and greatly enjoyed it. Thank you so much!",5
102667,The course have made my life so much easier! Both on a professional and a personal plane. Highly recommended for everyone!,5
102668,Beautiful mixed and executed.,5
102669,"Excellent course that shows how Buddhism can be rationally compared with modern psychology and how that comparison results in acceptance of its objectives, rules and believes since it is a ""modern"" philosophy from hundred years ago.",5
102670,"Concise and full of interesting ideas - a great introduction to many topics that are worth exploring, and think through.",4
102671,I am loving this course and it is giving me tons of new insight into life and the world!,5
102672,Buddhism is difficult area to understand. However this course helped a lot for me to understand about Buddhism.,5
102673,"Having a BA in Psychology as well as continuously studied Buddhism in the past, I find that this class is a perfect example of how those two worlds collide. I've heard in the past that most religions find themselves being disproved by science today, where as Buddhism is strengthened by science. From that point of view, I think this class is a perfect argument why Psychology should be treated as a science rather than an art in society, with its roots founded in the existence of humanity, and the evolution of humankind.",5
102674,this might change the way you live.,5
102675,Very exciting！I have learned a lot in Buddhism and Evolutionary Psychology!,5
102676,Great,5
102677,Thank you very much for this!! I´m living every minute of it,5
102678,"Really interesting and wonderful course! I got deeper insight into Buddhism and learned a lot about myself, too. I can only recommend this for people, who are interested in how Buddhist thought can be seen in modern life as still relevant.",5
102679,Very inspirational for my future studies. Thanks a lot.,5
102680,I am grateful that I have found this course.Very objective and analytical perspective. In depth discussions.A both academic and practical approach to Buddhism.Thank you so much!,5
102681,"I loved everything about the course, the professor, the people, even the dogs. I really appreciate what you are doing. Thank you very much!Sincerely, Manuel Ascanio",5
102682,"All lecture, no use of media",1
102683,"very interesting course, I just started finished week1, I am excited to continue the rest",5
102684,This course was very insightful especially the correlation to modern psychology. It has helped me understand so much in depth about our mind works and bring some rational that i had been struggling to comprehend from many spiritual discourses,5
102685,Good Balance explaining Modern Psychology and Buddhism as well as how the former has aided to support empirically most of the observations laid out by the latter centuries ago. Lectures are very insightful and carefully crafted turning the whole six week course into a delightful experience to those interested not only in Buddhism but also in Modern Psychology and behavioural theory.,5
102686,"Excellent course. My first, I enjoyed it very much.",5
102687,really interesting ...,5
102688,Love this course so far!,5
102689,A very important and insightful course.,5
102690,"Very well understandable, solid course.",5
102691,The best thing in this course is (next to great new ideas that I learned about) is the way mr Wright talks. A nice calm voice and amusing way of arguing. I loved it.,5
102692,"Very delightful course as it is more than well taught and full of interesting data, opinions and experiments. The videos are very helpful and provide us of a large names to look for and read about. The resources are pretty enough and interesting. Office hours have been a discover: great questions from students and ""being at home chatting with Robert"" feeling all around.I appreciate so much Robert´s enthusiasm and above all, his natural and funny way to explain course concepts with his dogs or with his attachments to dark chocolate or powdered sugar doughnuts.Many thanks to Robert and to all the technical stuff for providing us this course with all the work they had done.",5
102693,I really enjoyed the course. The professor was very down to earth.,5
102694,"This is one of if not the best course that I have taken. The instructor is outstanding and I find the lectures well prepared and well delivered. As an anthropology-zoology major and a meditator of about 5-years, I find this course as an incredible bridge between the science of the brain and the practice of mindfulness. I hope that Robert Wright will continue to create offerings for the Coursera world! Thank you so much for creating and providing this material.Craig Silverman",5
102695,"Enjoyed the comparison of buddhism and the modern psychology experiments! Chinese translation of Buddhism carries the essence in elegance, such as ""苦集灭道"" summarized four noble truths.",5
102696,Really interesting explanation of Buddhism through psychology and evolution.,5
102697,So far one of the best online courses on the topic I have met.,5
102698,"Wonderful course, great teacher, if your interested in the naturalistic world view of Buddhism I would highly recommend this course.",5
102699,"Excellent presentation of Buddhism in the context of a a ""naturalistic worldview"". Lots of food for thought with many pearls of insight.",5
102700,What an enlightening experience!,5
102701,Thank you very much! Very interesting and useful!,5
102702,Content and lectures are awesome. Wright is a brilliant teacher.,5
102703,Excellent course. Recommended for people who want to get introduced to the main principles of Buddhism and modern psychology from an evolutionary perspective.,5
102704,Great course,5
102705,Really an interesting course by a great professor. I'm enjoying it a lot and i totally recommend it.,5
102706,"Very nice course indeed, aimed at development of understanding of connections existing between Buddhism and Psychology. Robert Wright teaches online as I would expect it to be done in-person.",5
102707,An introduction to analysis of Buddhism from the perspective of modern science.Very good teacher.,5
102708,Must for everyone !,5
102709,I am finding this course really good.,5
102710,Wonderful Discussions! I loved the small interviews of experts to complement the discussions as the best part of the course.,5
102711,"Great professor, with a wide variety of vocabulary.",5
102712,It gives me a interesting way to look at life.,5
102713,"The second half of lectures were a little confusing, but nothing that a rewatch can´t solve!",4
102714,"Great course, so far. The way the connection between Buddhism, evolution and psychology is taught is VERY clear, concise and logic. I am a mathematician, who studies buddhism and loves psychology also, and have never seen an explanation so clear and connected to our culture like in this course. Awesome initiative!",5
102715,It was very nice. Thank you!,5
102716,Loved it... would love to see additional courses relating Buddhism to modern life,5
102717,"Very interesting course! Easy to follow without any background. I really loved it!!! I would recommend it to everyone who is interested in psychology, neuroscience, personal development, human evolution or religion studies. I also want to thank all people who participated in making this course, you did a great job! :)",5
102718,Very interesting course linking Buddhism and modern Psychology. Many of the things discussed are eye-opening and insightful. Recommend this course to anyone who are interested to learn how our mind work.,5
102719,Exceptionally well-done course,5
102720,"Although I do not have time to finish my assignments, I'd like to say: Your series of lectures have changed the way I look at life. Thank you, Robert and your inspiring dogs, Frasier and Milo.",5
102721,This course presents an introduction to the Buddhist teachings and an analysis of these teachings from a perspective of modern psychology (specially evolutionary psychology). A strong recommendation for anyone interested in better understanding our own minds.,5
102722,"Engaging, challenging course content. Numerous ways to interact with course mates. Appropriate assignments and discussions. Professional and knowledgeable coverage of the content.",5
102723,Great,5
102724,the best,5
102725,"it`s really amazing, thank you so so much",5
102726,I am just not feeling this course. I have done up to week five and still am not hooked. Sorry!,1
102727,Thank you for insight!,5
102728,"On to week 2 of this course. Loving this course. Awesome professor, awesome knowledge. Anyone interested in Buddhism will gain very good knowledge from this course!!",5
102729,"I loved Robert Wright before I took this class (I have read all his books and have REALLY enjoyed them!), and I love him even more after taking this class. His personality is fun, thoughtful, open, and kind (... and he's not bad to look at either), and his knowledge regarding Buddhism and Psychology is great. I learned quite a bit from this class. Thanks so much for this course. It's my favorite Coursera course thus far.",5
102730,"After completing this course, I have to say I'm impressed. Normally I struggle to pay attention, but I found this subject absolutely captivating. Also, the teacher was very engaged in his lectures and did a wonderful job explaining all the concepts he talked about in the lectures.",5
102731,"Most vibrant course about Buddhism and Meditation that I have ever encountered with. Starting with four noble truth, No-self and so on. I believe at the end of the course it might be skyrocketing me toward the emptiness. Simply great.",5
102732,I love Professor Donut!,5
102733,Easy to follow format and easy to work in to a busy schedule.,4
102734,This class should be mandatory ofr every human being. You will learn a lot about yourself.,5
102735,"This course helped me in a very turbulent period of my life. I now know what I truly want to be, and this course helped me on the way to discover such thing.",5
102736,Just and simple great!!!,5
102737,Amazing. Potentially life-changing.,5
102738,"I have been studying and practicing Buddha Dhamma for nearly 20 years and I would say this course is excellent. The lecturer is informed, and is able to combine ancient and modern knowledge in an illuminating manner. The lecturer is enjoyable to watch and is open to suggestions and constructive comments. Overall this is an excellent introduction to Buddhism and Modern Psychology and how they inform each other in a mutually beneficial synthesis.",5
102739,"The explanations are deep and also have a solid background, i've learned a lot.",5
102740,I'm only on the first lecture but I already love this course and find it so enlightening. Thank you!,5
102741,"I really enjoyed this course which was novel to combine some of the essential Buddhist teaching with what modern psychology could support and interpret. I would say, even if you studied psychology and read some Buddhist writers, that Dr. Wright delivers a professional and engaging course that will give one food for thought as well as making clear some esoteric Buddhist concepts one may struggle with. It's refreshing to find similarities between what science and the Buddha postulate regarding the self, attachment and that the assigning of form/feelings to our environment may cause unhappiness/dissatisfaction. Great course and well presented!",5
102742,"Very interesting course. Good depth into the subject matter, a bit more enthusiasm from the professor could go a long way into making the course a bit more vibrant.",4
102743,"Excellent course, easy to follow, very interesting. The videos are short enough to make a little progress every day or every now and then, without having to dedicate hours to one session. This course really helped me get interested in Buddhism, confirmed many thoughts I already had on meditation and made me discover new sides to it as well.",5
102744,This is a great course and I learned so much and now I feel like I can talk more intelligently about religion with my Buddhist friends.,5
102745,"Absolutely AWESOME course. Would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone, not only if they are interested in learning about Buddhism, but want to learn about life. Cannot say enough great things about the professor, the course, or the material in general.",5
102746,Thank you very much for all...,5
102747,A great course... Love it,5
102748,Superb. Very interesting and informative. Really enjoyed this course.,5
102749,very insightful course!,5
102750,Wonderfull course! It brought me to become a rational buddhist and to start my endeavor in brain study!,5
102751,"I admit to being a novice when it comes to Buddhist thought, but I've followed Robert Wright's work since reading The Moral Animal many years ago. I found the course to be a wonderful introduction to Buddhist thought, but more importantly an inventive and thoughtful attempt to connect that worldview and its prescriptions to current thinking in western psychology. Whether you're interested in evolutionary psychology, neuroscience or mindfulness - or better yet, all three - I think you'll find this course well worth your time. Mr. Wright is a wonderful writer and teacher.",5
102752,"I'm really enjoying this course, and especially like the written midterm and final (which we haven't submitted yet) and the peer review system which allows us to read other students' thoughts on the course material as well. Definitely recommended for anyone interested in either Psychology or Buddhism.",5
102753,I have been practicing meditation for two years already.In so far I have attended all Deepak Chopra meditation experiences which I found very helpful but not as helpful this course provided me so far.,5
102754,"An awesome course on psychology, for both newbies and students, but also an excellent introduction to Buddhism. I'm just perplex about the view of evolution as an entity that (seems to) shapes biological and psychological features with the purpose of obtaining advantages.",4
102755,"Brilliant and full of hope for humankind !The teaching is great because it is easily understandable on a cognitive point of view, the reamaining inner path is up to you ! Let's rebel angainst our incomplete thus efficient human nature ! and benefit of the last discoveries of modern psychology",5
102756,awesome insights from a more scientific perspective,5
102757,"Intellectually challenging yet clearly explained, this is the best class I have taken through Coursera. Dr. Wright is an insightful lecturer and provides a look at both Buddhism and modern psychology in a straight forward way clearing both subjects of unnecessary cultural clutter and jargon. As both subjects are analyzed in a logical, compelling manner, it becomes evident how their relationship informs us about the human situation through our evolutionary past and in our crisis ridden modern world. Very thought provoking and inspiring.",5
102758,Excellent narration by the Professor. A little trivialisation here and there is presumably for native audiences though it may seem irreverent to Indians like me. Linkage to Evolutionary Psychology is illuminating.,4
102759,"Just awesome. Highly recommanded. Good for person with some but not extensive knowledge of buddhism. Great teacher, love the subtle humour. Fun and greatly instructive.",5
102760,I learned a lot and loved the dogggies and the professor's sense of humor!,4
102761,"Greath, both the teachings and professor",5
102762,Dr. Wright did a excellent job in presenting the material in a manner that was both informative and highly engaging. His unique take on office hours is the best I've ever seen. Great course...,5
102763,The best introduction to secular budhism,5
102764,A bit thin on the psychology. References are not hard to find and post in Resources.,2
102765,"A thoughtful and well organized course that is, in itself, ""enlightening.""",5
102766,"Incredible course, the Professor is an amazing speaker and the interviews with specialists provided awesome insights. This is the kind of course that can really affect your outlook on life.",5
102767,Very interesting course. The teacher is professional with a bit of funny moments. The videos and the support material are very well organised.,5
102768,Fantastic. Need More practical experience,5
102769,"So far, I'm having a lot of fun - and writing proper essay assignments is proving to be something I've missed terribly since being in school/college etc!I'm really enjoying everything about this course!It's set out beautifully, there's a brilliant tutor and it's just fantastic!",5
102770,This is excellent! Robert Wright brings Buddhism alive with his lectures,5
102771,"A very well-informed and presented study of the ways in which various parts of Buddhism can be investigated by and compared with modern psychology. A valuable class for those interested in Buddhism, psychology, and meditation.",5
102772,"I really enjoyed this course! I have had an interest in Buddhist ideas, particularly meditation, but come from a very scientific mindset and want to see all ideas supported by experiments and empirical evidence. This course does a great job connecting results from psychology and neuroscience that aren't specifically about testing Buddhist philosophy and explaining how they support these ideas.",5
102773,Buddhist lite but very interesting to consider evolutionary psychology. Excellent contributors to the course content.,4
102774,It's incredible to be able to take these courses at home. I can't thank you enough for offering these course for free. Thank You!,5
102775,I cant wait to keep watching the lectures this is grea,5
102776,"I loved it! Easy to follow, great examples, amazing activities...I am so happy I decided to take this one!Congrats!",5
102777,Insightful and enjoyable course.,5
102778,Loved the whole association of psychology and Buddhism!,5
102779,Instructor explain in simple language with daily life experience examples for connectivity is amazing .,5
102780,"Lectures were interesting, fun, and...dare I say...enlightening? Though I was initially put off by having to write papers, I did see the value in it as I had to review the written transcripts of the video lectures and work to assemble my ideas and arguments for the essays. I would definitely take another class by Prof. Wright, Milo and Frasier.",4
102781,I really enjoyed the course. It gave me lots of new information about Buddhism and how it applies to modern life. Many thanks for a great course.,5
102782,"Great class, great material, and great professor!I love how the class is organized and how easy it is to understand.",5
102783,I still only partially through this course but I am very impressed. The professor is excellent; he brings humor into the lessons and explains everything in a way that we can understand. I also love the fact that he interviews various experts throughout the course in order to bring in even more perspectives. This class is extremely interesting to me and beyond my expectations. Thanks to the professor and to Coursera!,5
102784,"I am very attached to this Course & would find it extremely difficult not having an affective reaction to it. This is the second time I have audited this Course & hope to audit it each time it is available. Dr. Wright is a wonderful teacher & presents some very difficult concepts in very clear, concise, understandable language. Thank you so very much for this Course.",5
102785,It was a pleasure learning from this course. It has a lot of practical information with a very good scientific support. Thank you!,5
102786,The course was very interesting.Thanks!,4
102787,"Not only I enjoyed the course, but I learned a lot as much for Buddhism as for evolutionary psychology. It's been a shift off mind for me. Thanks to R. Wright and all that made this course possible. I'm very grateful!",5
102788,Such an inspiring course. You are helping me to see clearer Prof. Wright & Team by being aware of my biases.Thank you for that :-),5
102789,Excellent course for those who try to understand eastern philosophy from rational point of view. Also explains more clearly the effects of meditation and why it worth to try. This course shows that there is nothing mysterious or supernatural in this practice.,5
102790,Great course,5
102791,"The professor it's just excellent, what a character, must enroll.",5
102792,Overall a very engaging and thought-provoking course.,5
102793,Interesting and Fun!,5
102794,I hope to gain insight of my own and others view of the world enjoying it so far would like more life examples in the videos,5
102795,"Really enjoyed the course, especially the Frasier and Milo show! (office hours)",5
102796,"A very rebellious upstream swim against natural selection and the Buddhist Neo's heroic effort to Nibbana! Drawing parallels to evolutionary and social psychology, Robert Wright takes you in an inward journey that brings to clear focus the origin of suffering and the prescriptive teachings of Gautama the Buddha to overcome suffering by embracing your true self. If you are looking for personal mastery, this is for you. If you have intense cravings, this is for you. If you are afflicted with compulsive behaviors, this is for you. If you are thinking ""what the heck is all this"", trust me, this course is for you.",4
102797,This course introduced me to my current school of Buddhism and that has changed my life.,5
102798,I don't like the idea of writing 800 words essays in English though.,4
102799,"Very interesting,The teacher is very clear and it s nice to lesson to him.",5
102800,An excellent course! Very highly recommended!,5
102801,This course is awesome! So very interesting.,5
102802,very clear and understandable course Thanks !,5
102803,This is the 2nd time taking this course and I find it more interesting and a deeper experience after a second review. The online references are also very helpful! Great job!,5
102804,Great insights into both: Psychology and Buddhism! Thanks!,5
102805,"I love this course, I am so excited it is back up and I will be taking it for a second time!",5
102806,It's a wonderful course,5
102807,"I learned a bunch of things, thank you very much.",5
102808,"The lectures are great, and the material covered is awesome. I do not own a copy of the accompanied textbook, but I imagine that this course would be even better if I did.Sometimes the homework sessions felt a little contrived - but I am fairly certain that this was just an artifact of making them peer-gradable.",4
102809,Prepare yourself for the fact that if you want to really understand all the programs and theory in this course you will need at at least 8 hours per week. But if you cope with all the problems you will get not bad skills in python programming and overall statistical mechanics understanding.,5
102810,Nice but demanding course. No course certficate is available after passing the course...,3
102811,I really like this course also I am only confused by my knowledge in computing because this course is very high rated in sense of detailed explanation and easy to follow through difficult themes.,5
102812,All is said. Strongly recommended,5
102813,great course. wish could cover more physics,5
102814,"I learned a lot from all kinds of algorithms that I heard of, but never had the chance to get the clarifications.",5
102815,Awesome course for anyone aspiring to learn Statistical mechanics. The problems treated are far from trivial. Instruction and course material is very good,5
102816,great and succinct course,5
102817,"Excellent online lecture, the best I have ever taken.",5
102818,Perfect Course!,5
102819,"The course is excellent. Great quality of supplied material, teachers and assignments. I rate it on the fact that I was able to follow it and learn quite a lot on a subject that is far from easy, and I'm pleased with the results.The only issue / recommendation I can point out : The course is not very specific on the needed background. As an example, I took this course being an engineer with a decent understanding of maths, a less-decent understanding of physics (almost no quantum physics background), and experience with python programming: in my case, it required a lot of effort in order to follow some of the chapters (specially the ones focused in quantum physics), and normally always more than the normal 8 hs/week. I recommend the student to have some background on probability theory / functions and python programming so as to follow easier, and expect some difficulty in fully understanding some of the subjects. I still rate it 5 stars.",5
102820,a great course!,5
102821,An exceptionally brilliant course.Exceptionnel. Nutzlich. Speciale.,5
102822,"I like this course very much, I dropped out once because some of the homework questions are not quite obvious for me. After refer to other material, I survived the course. Frankly speaking, I am still not familiar with most of the contents. But this course displayed a vivid picture of MCMC. I will keep learning the subject in the future.The discussion session is too quiet, maybe I should have asked more questions.",4
102823,Really good course. Thanks for all that work you put in the lectures.,5
102824,Way over my head but hope to keep working at it.,5
102825,"This course was awesome! Although, I can tell I'll need another pass at it to understand things more fully...",5
102826,"Brilliant course, lots of advanced material, pretty much exceptional way of teaching. The difficulty is just right. Appreciate the effort of the team.",5
102827,"A great introduction to the ideas of statistical mechanics and Monte Carlo methods. I also like Dr. Krauth's sense of humour. He begins by imagining children on the beach in Monte Carlo, computing pi by throwing pebbles.If you're looking for a nice set of lectures followed by easy multiple choice questions, this course isn't for you. The lectures and tutorials are very professional, Dr. Krauth & his students have done a great job, but the assignments are where you will learn the most. They are hard work, and I found I had to think hard. Don't leave them until the last minute: start early, and break for a walk outside when you get stuck. They really teach the ideas.I started this course to support other coursework as was doing, as I felt my command of thermodynamics was a bit shaky. I've found it enjoyable in its own right.",5
102828,The course is self-contained. Very good for people even if they are not physicist. They can still learn a lot about computational methods that are useful in many ways.,5
102829,Material is very interesting and the courser work provides great opportunities to try out and build different statistical algorithms. You don't need a background in physics but I think it would help to fully grasp the materials.,5
102830,This course is superbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb!,5
102831,Deepen my trust in Monte-Carlo and Markov Chain Monte-Carlo simulation --- exact mimic their analytical counterpart.Also get the chance to touch the spirit of Quantum Mechanics.,5
102832,great course and clever instruction!,5
102833,"Not one of the easiest courses, but extremely interesting!",5
102834,Great course!!! I've learned a lot. I don't give 5 stars only because sometimes professors were not so clear speaking.,4
102835,"Very good with lots of information on a quite vast topic: wireless communication and RF principles, radio resources management, multiple antenna theory and their application in LTE.",5
102836,The course content was quite informative and resourceful only te assessments need to be more tougher!,5
102837,This is so useful for network communications and mobile communications as well,4
102838,"The transcripts are not actually same, so its difficult sometimes to get what speaker is saying as accent is hard to understand.Content is good but its not depth for engineering students",4
102839,Awesome course. Well explained and comprehensive material.Good work done by all the course Professors.Thank You!,5
102840,Great course to understand the basic concepts of wireless communication.,5
102841,Excellent course! Great opportunity to express yourself with a video in the final peer reviewed assignment!,5
102842,very useful course,5
102843,I very much enjoyed the course assignments.,4
102844,"It is very interesting and a very wide approach of violence, from theoretical grounds to practical applications. I would have prefered a little bit more information focused on the latter, especially regading intervention and prevention. Otherwise, great.",4
102845,The course is very thorough. It covers so many different fields and gives you a good idea at how broad violence is. It's approach is different and effective. The course is something I'd highly recommend especially if you are someone who's profession deals with violence in some shape or form.,5
102846,This is an important class for one and all.,5
102847,"interesting course way to feminized. It did not take into account that women can also be violent, if not more so. It only focused on the fact that men are violent and almost no discussion of women being violent towards men.",3
102848,Good general overview. Only wish it was longer and could cover material in more detail.,4
102849,Interesting for US-Americans or people who are interested in US-American Epidemiologics. Very US-centered,3
102850,Great course.,3
102851,ready to get into the nitty gritty,5
102852,"This course provides a very broad understanding of violence prevalent in the United States and globally. Statistics and critical self-reflection points are provided throughout the course. If you're looking for a course to challenge your views of violence or, simply, to enhance your knowledge of the subject matter, this course is for you.",4
102853,Excellent course. It makes you analyze yourself own thoughts and ideas about violence.,4
102854,"Great course on Networking, could be better if NSURLSession is also included alongwith catching",5
102855,Great course!,5
102856,"This was another excellent course in the iOS specialization by Prof. Don Patterson. However, Prof. Patterson's teaches students many important concepts prevalent in iOS apps, such as integration with various social networking applications, working with data in local on-device storage, and push notifications. Once again, I found Prof. Patterson's style to be very engaging (a most difficult task especially for online lectures) and the course materials to be well thought out.Only one caveat though: The name of the course is a little misleading: there isn't much of a discussion about security features of iOS (I would have expected a course covering security in iOS to at least talk about using cryptography inside apps.)",5
102857,"Due to change from xcode 7 to 8, important parts of these lectures are outdates. Hence, it get complicated to follow the course.",2
102858,Great way to teach I am enjoying it,5
102859,Very nice course. It would have been nice if even the remote storage was added into this curriculum.,5
102860,Excellent Starter course for Core data and networking.,4
102861,"Although the name of the course is a bit misleading, the content it covers is good and is worth the price you pay for it. Instructor is very informative and knows what he's talking about. Quizzes and assignments are a bit easy for my taste but thats a minor gripe.",5
102862,"Amazing course, everything you need to know about network calls and security. 5/5",5
102863,Material for the course is outdated.,1
102864,Very productive course all-around.,5
102865,Its great way to learn more about iOS development. Professor is fantastic and material is very helpful.,5
102866,"After all, i enjoy this course. Hope pro.Don will update for amazing swift.",5
102867,"The course needs to be updated to reflect API and third-party service changes, but the JSON material and (especially) the core storage lesson are well worth the effort.",4
102868,"Good course, but not that much network and not so much security. Nevertheless, good course with useful techniques and explanations.",4
102869,"Without a doubt the worst course I have ever taken anywhere. When the instructor, who is supposed to be teaching you how to write iOS apps, takes (no exaggeration) SIX minutes to even figure out how to open XCode, you know you're in for a rocky ride. Still, I stuck with it for three more weeks. To my horror, the course only got worse from there.This course was clearly thrown together with a minimum of effort by someone who is not qualified to teach the subject. It's an insult to Coursera customers, and a major failure of quality control.",1
102870,"Very nice teacher, very nice course!",5
102871,Thi course covers up the basics of networking and security for iOS applications using Objective-C. It's a great course if you want to understand the basics and want to implement in practice some of these topics. I just wish it cover more cases and more apps. But for that this should be a course more longer than it is. Nevertheless it's a great course.,4
102872,This series of courses are great. The ones I've taken. Good Job!!!,5
102873,You should skip module 8 from week 3. You can't work along because the website parse.com do not accept new members....Don't rush to purchase an apple developer account!,3
102874,Great for beginner for network and security knowledge and hands-on for iOS app,5
102875,"This course was not as good as the first course. I found myself typing codes mindlessly a lot and feeling the guilt that I'm not learning a lot from the app I'm making because there is too much coding going on and it's not clear what's more important. The final exam was too easy (almost a joke!) and it didn't help me figure out if I actually did learn something by typing out all these codes. I would like more lecture, snippet of codes and explaining what they do and have us fill out part of a code by thinking through as oppose to typing out the whole thing.",3
102876,"The material and videos are so poor, and low quality, I am happy to not have bought this course",1
102877,"Great material, a bit confusing to follow on certain assignments where there's live code writing, troubleshooting and turning off/on of the recording.",4
102878,"Really good information, good quality presentation. The working examples are well chosen and fun to work along with. Thank you!",5
102879,"I expected more information about security,",4
102880,"I would say that prior programming knowledge would be a big advantage, otherwise it might become a copying exercise without necessarily knowing what you're doing. I like the fact that the videos show that not everything works smoothly in the sense that it's easy to make mistakes, even by Don :-)",5
102881,Great course with a lot of examples on integration with social networks and secure transportation layer.,4
102882,"nice course! great teacher, very helpful for beginner!",5
102883,Very well-organized and intuitive course,5
102884,Perfect!,5
102885,"The content has a very good breadth component(covering json response handling,core data and push notifications.The very important components of iOS).All of them have been handled in suitable depth.Professor Don Patterson's diction and style of teaching is great.As I'm currently working as an iOS engineer, it is helping me a lot in expanding my skills.",5
102886,Pretty good explanation.,5
102887,I really enjoed this course!,5
102888,Learned a lot from this class. Thanks!,5
102889,"Very cool course, well prepared lectures and I'm glad to stumble on it.",5
102890,"I believe the professor has once again succeeded in walking through beginners through more advanced concepts like social media integration and core data. It's not so much the course that is amazing just because it's talking about iOS app development, but it's the teamwork of the professor and the app developer and their genuine commitment to high level and crystal clear tutorials and explanations. The professor never once skipped over anything. Each item is explained to a level of professional detail. In return, as an educator, I will publicly praise UC Irvine and its exceptional faculty member.",5
102891,Great,4
102892,Excellent intermediate level course for objectives C. Good approach to the course presentation. Introduces concepts clearly and then drives into actual implementation.,5
102893,Good course; very interesting. I would like to see the professor grade the course papers or at least review them instead of stric,4
102894,Seems promising course. Lets check this,5
102895,"$450 for this course and they can't even bother to make sure that the quizzes are scored correctly? Two weeks back to back and one question each week has been counted wrong when answered correctly. That, paired with the fact that your only method to have an assignment graded is via peer review means that I'll be suggesting peers save their money on this course. It's entirely possible that you could be stranded with no one to grade your work - Coursera's suggestion if this should occur is that you should beg on the forums - or transfer your work to a later session of the same course. Good content, awful policies intended to allow the platform to be hands-off for Coursera - that's unacceptable at this price.",1
102896,"Great course. Really good for those who want to be managers/leader, and those who are already leaders. Lots of reading required, but it is OK.",4
102897,cool！it is very useful!,5
102898,Excellent course to get your brain thinking. Opens your eyes into a leadership sight. Help yourself,5
102899,Well organized and good lessons/presentations!I suggest to insert more exercises/assignment to increase the student's skills!,4
102900,this is a great course for anyone who wants to develop a career in research. videos are great and engaging. the tutor makes biostatistics very simple and easy to understand.,5
102901,"This is indeed a unique course, as it teaches statistics specifically tailored for public health researchers. Even without any prior exposure to statistics, the course is very well designed to comfortably guide the student from the fundamentals to the more complex topics at a convenient pace. The exercises and tests are very useful and I especially appreciated that many key concepts were repeated at timely intervals so that there was little need to keep referring to older lectures. I now feel much more confident about my statistical skills and most importantly I have a clearer understanding of the various statistical measures and analytical tools that are regularly used in public health research. Thank you to all the course designers and teachers!",5
102902,"This has got to be the best, or one of the best statistical courses I have ever taken, and I have taken a fair few by now. My understanding of key statistical concepts such as p values, confidence intervals, standard error and more has considerably improved. The way the instructor tied the material to published studies made the course very interesting and kept me curious throughout it, even though in my research area I have little to no need of some of the analysis that was covered. The slides, however, can be improved. There are too many typos and errors on most presentations which can get quite confusing. Still, The negatives are negligible compared to the positives. This course is highly recommend.",5
102903,"Very clear lecture, easy to follow. Helped me with the important concepts with statistics. Highly recommend for beginners.",5
102904,"What makes this course great is that it builds from almost no understanding at all, all the way up to quite a comprehensive skillset. The way John has built the course means you have an understanding of the basic principles at play when doing the most common statistical tests and this is incredibly satisfying. Would highly recommend for anyone in medicine or public health. 5*",5
102905,Good practice exercices and with detailed solutions,5
102906,"good course, poor slides in pdf",4
102907,This is a very interesting course I am really enjoying it.,5
102908,"I used to rely on statistical experts in published articles to determine if the results were significant. After attending this course I can determine the level of significance myself, and published studies is even more interesting to read about today.",5
102909,Great learning !!!,5
102910,Excellent course provided by prof. McGready. I recommend it to everyone who wants to start a solid background for biostatistics.,5
102911,"i enjoyed the course, however i am having an immense problem trying to get the certificate despite having paid for it and completing all my assignments. i need help in this. thanks",5
102912,"Simple to understand, well organised",5
102913,"Before I enrolled in this course, I had heard a lot about Prof. McGready's teaching skills. After having taken Statistical Reasoning for Public Health 1, I must say how fortunate I was of having had him as an online instructor. I firmly believe he really cares about your learning process and finds the easier way to explain difficult concepts without losing quality in education. Awesome experience!",5
102914,I believe that these two serial courses revise and improved my statistical skills for public health.,5
102915,It's a great course to get a better understanding of English Language at University.,5
102916,Awesome tips on academic writing.,5
102917,"I was studied about academic writing but did not finish, still reading on recommend references. Academic writing tells about communicative what is the objective of the essay who is your audience. Academic writing looks about the flow and writibg style. It avoid writing in short form like can't and ensures vocabulary.",4
102918,I would recommend the course for everyone who would start new classes at university including intermediate level researcher like me! Best of Luck!,5
102919,"Has plenty of material, the activities are most of the time very useful. I spent a lot of time reading the AWELU material and other web references, that were extremely valuables for me; however, the videos sometimes are not very productive and slow paced and some activities came very often and were not needed.",4
102920,It's very useful and I am appreciate about the teachers have done.,5
102921,"Great content, great professor!",5
102922,Nice course for starting web app development career,5
102923,"This is a great introductory course. It focuses on client-side development and teaches you HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Web-hosting and domain name servers are also explained to give students an idea where websites actually are located and how to find them. After completing the course you will be able to design your own interactive web page, and even make it accessible on the world wide web if you desire. Definitely take this course if you are interested in learning the basics of web development.",5
102924,Great course for beginnersThis is a good course for people that have no experience in web development or for people that have done web development and want to refresh their memory.,5
102925,Good materials to start with web development,5
102926,"Great course for beginners to get the basics of Web Development, HTML, CSS and Javascript.",5
102927,"Good introduction, but too few concrete examples.",4
102928,this is a very good course,5
102929,"From this i learned more things and more thinks about the web development and design in html,css,js and more and i thanks to coursera and UC DAVIS and I desire to spread my knowledge to others on the right of justice.",5
102930,Enjoyed the Foundation of Web Development. For the next iteration of the course I would suggestion going over in more detail how HTML and JavaScript should be linked with using JavaScript validation. This was something many learners struggled with and the provided resources missed some key things beginners would struggle to grasp.,4
102931,"Good course, comprehensively covering key concepts involved in Web development. Although It does not touch server side development, but provides foundation to pursue advanced courses in web development and design. Thanks Coursera.",4
102932,"Even though I haven't been able to purchase the course (yet!), I am very glad that I decided to take this anyway~ It's like an into course for dummies! Except without making you feel dumb~ Lol.",5
102933,"I did learn a bit of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and plan on learning more on my own. I enjoyed the course overall but felt like it should have been longer and more introductory for those of us who knew nothing about programing concepts.",4
102934,Good course for beginners.,5
102935,Over all the course was very informative and easy to understand for a beginner.,4
102936,"Very good course! I would recommend it to anyone interested in understanding how websites work. Great introduction to web development, it has spurred me on to learn more, and I feel confident that I can do this now. Thank you.",5
102937,"A bit too much JavaScript, but even that part was well done! I hope there will be another course with server-side scripting as well, at least for beginners :-)",5
102938,This is a great course! I love its structure - it begins with info about hosting and domain name (something many others courses don't touch on) and it gives us enough guidance to start html coding before moving on to Javascript. I appreciate the precise short videos (10 mins or less each) because overly long videos tend to make me lose focus. The instructor is very knowledgeable and has industry experience in web designing and it shows as he shares his knowledge (for example I never knew <a> tag stands for anchor..woot). I love this course........oh have I said this already? :),5
102939,awesome teaching,5
102940,Great to put it into action!,5
102941,I am very glad for such amazing tool like this one. It´s very good within SEO standpoint in his practical experience and for our recall for variety of the tools in this spectrum.,5
102942,Great Course & Specialization !,5
102943,The evaluation forms of the last two milestone projects are quite burdensome for students to grade by item.,4
102944,"Thank you Rebekah and the rest of the team because right now I have a new career. Just this week I started to help a client with a clinic who needs to improve his local SEO because his clinic didn't show up in the local search for the services he provide. Just working for a week and today he is number one in one of the keywords. I'm so proud that I was able to help him. Thank you, thank you, thank you!",5
102945,If you want to be an expert in SEO and work in the field this is the series of courses to lean the craft.When you complete this course you will be ready to put your skills to work!,5
102946,Interesting and good explanations from the teacher,5
102947,This is actually the best course I have had on this platform to date.,5

102955,More challenging than the first class but set up so you have all the tools to learn and grow.,5
102956,The course contained very interesting materials as well as very useful practices for search engine optimization. I can reflect the assistance of one the course Mentors Mr. Hatem AbdAlsama which was kind enough to give me a peer review and leave a kind note afterwards.,5
102957,"This course is really something, now i have a much clearer picture then i had before taking this course, i am feeling confident now. The way they designed the course, it is great.",5

102969,Great course. I keep learning a lot.,5
102970,Very interesting and useful course. I will inscribe in the next courses of the program.,5
102971,The course is to the point and very practical approach and easy to implement on websites.,5
102972,Very in-depth and detailed information. Well prepared. Thank you.,5
102973,"An excellent course - a step by step guide to dissecting the factors that go into SEO and how to improve them. Unlike many other online courses, this one actually teaches the skills that can be readily implemented. Hats off to Ms. Rebekah May and the entire team behind this.",5
102974,A great course that gave me great insight into SEO. I received more than I expected.,5
102975,i really enjoyed learning this session. :),5
102976,A must for anyone wanting to understand the nuts & bolts of SEO.,5
102977,Very interesting and useful!,5
102978,"Good subject, after learn this subject i can get alot of things about SEO.",5
102979,"Excellent course and very well taught. I was amazed by how clearly it was explained to people who may not have a background in this field, it is definitely useful for those trying to transition into new careers and understand more about digital marketing through areas such as SEO. Thank you!",5
102980,"Content is very condensed - but fine.However, you need to pay to do the quizzes and even the peer assessment - something where you are contributing by reviewing other participants work. Charging me for supporting other participants and supporting a 'learning community mindset' seems ridiculous to me.",1
102981,"Very good and clear course, again! And done in an interesting way.",5
102982,"I signed up to audit the first 5 courses in this specialization. This review is for the first 3 of these courses taught by Rebekah May.I don't know that SEO is truly simple and logical or if it just appears this way because of how clear and easy to listen to Ms. May is. I do feel she has supplied a lot of very useful information, pointed to a lot of great tools and websites., and am already making improvements as a result of her classes.",5
102983,"Helpful introductory, but should place more emphasis on the ools you could use to perform SEO Tasks.",4
102984,"I've learned a lot SEO basic in other tutorial but not same as like this course, very constructive and digging deep my insight in SEO knowledge.",5
102985,Great course I do wish the tools were introduced or at least downloaded in this section instead of fundamentals.,4
102986,"Even if you consider yourself well-aware of SEO fundamentals this course is definitely worth taking. The tutor explains the topics in a simple, but yet very informative way. I liked her approach and the whole structure of her course.",5
102987,I found the assignment quite difficult as I felt that what we were asked to do was not possible. At least not with Accuracy. No matter how many web pages I tried to analyse and with how many different free tools I seemed to come up with the same 2 issues.....if the page was performing badly (which was the type of page we were recommended to choose) there was not enough traffic to it to gather any information/demographics. However even when I chose a popular page I was unable to obtain the requested information because it was not my website so I was not entitled to view this information - again returning zero results. So I am a little confused as to how we are expected to answer (truthfully?!) questions such as:Who are the main visitors? Where are they from? Where did you obtain this information???,2
102988,I've learned a lot more tools and I know this will help me to further my career. Thank you so much for ever being informative and interesting.,5
102989,"This course is sooooo much better than the intro course, which I am happy to say i was refunded for. This one dispenses useful and practical information right from the start. My only issue now is that I'd like to get the full specialization, but I'm not paying for that first useless course (sorry if that sounds harsh, just being honest). I highly recommend you make the first course optional or free to people who take the remaining courses and want to receive the specialization.I'm rating 4 stars because I haven't finished the course yet so want to see how my learning will be tested in the end before forming a final opinion. So far it's just been a few questions, but I like the way they pop up at unexpected times during the presentation. Keeps me alert :)",4
102990,I learned a lot. Nothing better one can say about it.,5
102991,"She's thorough and doesn't read from the slides. You can tell she knows her stuff. Also she provides good resources. One thing i would appreciate is if she goes over how to use some of the many SEO tools for analyzing a website that she discusses apart from screaming frog e.g., google analytics.",5
102992,"Highly comprehensible course, structured information, valuable resources.",5
102993,This course is very good. It would have been nice to have the slides hence four stars.,4
102994,Thanks for the great course madam i learned a lot from this and looking forward to complete the specialization.,5
102995,Simply Superb,5
102996,Awesome course,5
102997,Really good second SEO Course. Smoothly takes the learner in the deeper knowledge and the new set of skills for a true SEO knowledge.,5
102998,Amazing for people getting started with SEO. Would recommend this course to any (online) marketing professionals.,5
102999,The course materials are very good for anyone who wants to get into SEO. I only gave 4 stars because I personally dislike the quizzes. They don't focus on what's important but rather on small detail questions that don't really matter.Other than that it's a great course! Most of it you can find in books too but with videos & the community it's more fun to learn on Coursera.,4
103000,"This course learn you practical information about foundamentals of SEO such as on-page, off-page and technical SEO.",5
103001,It is my second course on this speciality! I love it! Tons of useful information!Thank you guys!,5
103002,Perfect for beginners in SEO,5
103003,This course has good thematic. Your benefit is you can understand basis of SEO.,5
103004,Best one. Very informative. But I don't know why they are referring us to read 3/4 years blog while SEO is changing on daily basis.,5
103005,Cool little project for analyzing websites that we want to rank.,5
103006,Great content for beginners.Especially appreciated given that the topic is not yet well covered by MOOCs.,5
103007,Very helpful and the host is great! I learned so much and really enjoyed every bit of it!,5
103008,Instructor was passionate and clear to understand. She made the course enjoyable and the course content easy to digest,5
103009,"The teacher is very good, her explanations are always very clear and she is giving practical advice. She is also sharing a lot of her professional experience, very useful to get a better understanding of the field.",5
103010,This course has so much detail and depth. Thank you for it,5
103011,It's a great course!,5
103012,Very interesting course. It took me through the basics of SEO for a website. I used the concepts thought in this course in my current job and it has helped me gain credibility from my supervisor.,5
103013,So far Excellent course. The instructor is so nice. Highly recommended for beginners,5
103014,The course gives a great overview as well as a deeper introduction to SEO,5
103015,A very good cours!,5
103016,The course was really helpful for basic knowledge of SEO. I learned a lot and fount it very helpful. So thanks a lot for the resources provided online.,5
103017,"This course was just amazing. Ecery single concept of the course is useful, widely explained and applied throughout the assignments. The final week is the best one because you apply all the concepts in a website.I think that if you don't have the chance to see results in your own website, you might still think you only learned the theory. However, I had the chance to apply my knowledge on my university's website and so far, its metrics have already started to improve. I hope that after reading this and finishing the course, you will be as delighted as I am now.",5
103018,"Poor grading system. Based on 2 peers' ""subjective"" points of your week4 analysis assignment, even if you digested all the materials and received 100% on quizzes all weeks, you will have to repeat taking this course endlessly. At first I thought I did not analyze thoroughly so on my second session, I basically rewrote the whole assessment, followed by samples passed students gave me, also making sure I covered all the points the instruction asked me to cover, peer gives me 1 or 1.5 point for writing persona with little detail. I wrote 350 words persona, with stories and demographic of my target audience. Because I am 2.5 points short or so, I have to take this same course for the next round session for the third time, wait it it reaches week 4, resubmit my analysis that is now edited for 4 times. There is no clear guideline, format, or even sample provided, but the grades are left to the peers. Some pass with less than 300 word analysis with a lot of charts and pictures. I did as well but wasn't lucky at my first round so I developed 3 pg. analysis all in words to make it look like a true analytical report, didn't pass again. I do not know what this instructor is looking for as a form of assessment/analysis paper, and only those who are lucky enough to meet sensible peer graders pass. Waste of time, waste of money no one wants to spend lifetime to get a certificate especially when one knows what he or she is talking about.",1
103019,It is very easy to realize the course content and also provides practical tools to go.,5
103020,Ably length videos with good blog sites to read on.,5
103021,"Challenging, thorough and engaging. Repetitive in a good way, by gently going back over content you almost learn by default. The quizzes are professionally prepared and sometimes tough to pass! This is good as you are obliged to think hard, even go back through materials or ask others for advice until the knowledge sticks. Highly recommended and of great practical value.",5
103022,It was OK. There is nothing you will gain from this course that you can't get in a single 1/2 hour youtube video instead of 100 2 minute videos here. The assignments were questionable and the examples used in the first assignment at least no longer exist.,2
103023,"Sometimes it's not important to be able to DO the subject, but just understand the language to ask the right questions. This was an informative and helpful insight into optimization fundamentals.",5
103024,"The content is great, and the lectures are clear, but this course was made in a rush: there are many bugs throughout the quizzes and there is no contact at all with the lecturer in the forums, and there is no teaching stuff present in the forums.",5
103025,Great course!,5
103026,Love this course! Really learnt a lot!,5
103027,Great way to understand the fundamentals of SEO and to begin a new career.......Thanks Rebekah !,5
103028,"Course quality went downhill, compared to previous course in series. No 'teacher' involvement in comments / questions. Mistakes within quizzes. Both practice and rated.",3
103029,Excellent class! Thank you for making SEO-learning experience simple and effective!,5
103030,Very good course with all the in and outs.,5
103031,"Good content, but blocked quizes in free version is bad idea.",2
103032,"Great course to get started on SEO! After applying this knowledge on my own website, I have seen noticeable improvements. I totally recommend it.",5
103033,"The material is interesting and new, on that part the instructor is doing a good job.What is really VERY annoying about this course is the fact that in case you have questions/problems relating anything of the course material and you (as said by the instructor) post them to the discussion forums, there is COMPLETELY NO REPLY neither from the instructor, nor from the Coursera.There were obvious mistakes in one of the quizzes and lots of students were posting and discussing this in the forums (as this was actually preventing students from passing the course), but there was no answer whatsoever.I find this very unprofessional, especially because of the fact that this was a paid course. I do not know (and I also do not care) who is responsible for this - Coursera or the instructors, but this is something that should not be present in any of the courses on Coursera.I liked the first course very much, but the mentioned part of the second course was so annoying that I really would not recommend taking this course to new students.Sorry.",1
103034,Very relevant topics and well put..,5
103035,"Excellent content, but I would prefer the assignments be evaluated and rated by experts, not the colleagues.",4
103036,Awesome Course ! Great Presentation and great Information ! Thank you a lot Prof. Rebekah May,5
103037,"Good, but too slow at times considering it is just a high level view of basics. Distractingly weird hand gestures.",3
103038,I found the assignment given to be very thorough in allowing students to demonstrate learned knowledge in a real world situation.,5
103039,A wonderful course,5
103040,I really enjoy the all session of the this course and learn many things .Thank youKayes,5
103041,Very good course. Awesome content.,5
103042,Great introduction to the fundamentals of SEO. The assignments and questions as well thought out. I've benefited immensely from this course.,5
103043,Explained the most important technical points necessary for SEO.,5
103044,Very good content but it only gives a general view on each topic not going too deep on technical SEO and keyword research.,5
103045,Great Course ! Recommended !,5
103046,"Awesome, thank you for the great course!",5
103047,Very Organized And Resourceful,5
103048,Excellent course contents and a logical structured organization of the topics.,5
103049,"Unbelievable, you are great ( all the courses are great).",5
103050,"Very poor. Full of errors in videos and quizzes (which affect final grade), no response from course organizers in the forum to multiple complaints from learners, and extremely thin on content. Could have been merged into the first course of the specialization (Introduction to SEO).I've taken $49 one-off certificate classes that provided 4-10 hours of content for 6-8 weeks; for this course I was charged $119 for 1-3 hours of content for what was supposed to be 4 weeks. I completed the course in a couple of days and felt like I learned more from free resources like Moz. Complete rip-off and easily the worse course of the half dozen I've taken on Coursera on various topics. It seems like you're paying for the UC Davis name on the certificates rather than the content.In addition to all that they dropped the price from $119 to $79 per course for the specialization after I paid for it, and refuse to refund the price difference. Fine - but if I'm paying a premium price I expect much better content and service than was received.",1
103051,"Excellent course providing the basis of SEO - very well laid out, well paced and full of useful information.",5
103052,"she can go in depth more and give us more and more information. but still, i like it.thank you coursera",3
103053,"I found this very useful for the beginning with SEO. There are lots of the areas to deepen, but for general understanding it was really convenient.",4
103054,"highly useful, practical and informative! A very structured way to learn SEO",5
103055,"Great case study, but the way to engage the audience might have been way better. Assignments were individual and it was very difficult to use them at full power, because they were quite boring. Interaction with other learners would be very beneficial in a form of group assignment. Videos are very boring and useless in comparison to incredible content in the first 6 courses of the specialization. Capstone should have been done by the same (high) standards as other courses in specialization.",3
103056,GREAT specialization - I will certainly advance in my career because of this!,5
103057,"Guys - You are the best! I really enjoyed your course. My Grandmother was born in Tomsk, and all her family lived in Tomsk. I would love to come and visit you all.Take Care! Happy New Year!",5
103058,GREAT GREAT COURSE !!!! Suitable for people who don't speak Russian and who want to learn it!,5
103059,"A bit too much useless mumbo jumbo, that can be concluded in a few sentences. Good for those that are new to videomaking, and good for some classic movies mentioned in the course.",3
103060,it is meaningful!,5
103061,The course was really useful. Quite detailed on learning how to build a successful content MKT strategy. My suggestion would be to have more graded open questions during the other weeks so that we could build a more detailed plan as a final task. Congratulations!,5
103062,"This course is not as well designed as the preceding courses in this certification. The instructor's lessons are poorly organized, his activities offer little value, and the quiz questions and answers are poorly written with regards to grammar and depth of knowledge. The author also does a lot of self-promotion with regards to his company, his research studies, and his book.The only positive to this class is that it progresses quickly, making the lack of quality more tolerable. Had this been the first course in this certification, I would have dropped out and looked for a better program.",2
103063,"This course introduce you to some kind of good behaviours to apply to social media. But actually it is some kind of well manners that everybody should apply in social life. Of course it makes you aware that in both cases you should apply the same behaviour, but I found it a bit too logical...",2
103064,Great course. Huge amount of content. Lecturers are easy to listen to. Be sure to allow enough time for the reading and major assignments. The readings take much longer than indicated.,5
103065,"Brilliant, really liked this course. Really interesting, great assignment.",5
103066,"One piece of improvement is to stream line the peer graded assignment. I noticed a slight disconnect between the writing prompt and the grading rubric particularly around the implementation of metrics to track success of content improvement initiatives. What would be wrong to use the grading rubric as a baseline for the writing prompt that can be used as a guideline for student to follow when drafting his response. This would save a lot of back and forth between submitting a blank sheet of work in order to see how the grading is set up, then going back to adjust the original work to make it fit the grading sheet.",4
103067,Very well organized and informative course.,5
103068,Geat course!,5
103069,"Very practical, thorough and well presented. The presenter's self confidence comes through and adds great credibility to the course. Very easy to comprehend and listen too.",5
103070,great course really enjoyed it and learnt a lot.,5
103071,"While I think the teacher is an expert on the matter, this course what somewhat less structured and clear as the other courses in the specialisation. The teacher covered a range of topics, but didn't provide clear frameworks or structures for how to deal with different issues. I've done the three prior courses of SEO in the series and they were extremely clear and have a lot of valuable tools and frameworks to work with. I would also have appreciated some discussion again about metrics in this course - specifically related to content marketing.",3
103072,Great Certification Programme for those looking forward to learning Content and Social Media Marketing.,5
103073,"Overall a decent course to audit, but I think it was almost too repetitive and lacked a lot of substance. It would have been nice to really focus on great content types, versus share, share, share.",3
103074,Great class with a lot of experiences case sharing and materials.,5
103075,The Great Course! Very complex and interesting strategy of Influencer marketing.,5
103076,"1 star for the course, the video's are longer than needed because the instructor could be telling his stories in a more structured way. There's too much self-promotion (or maybe that's normal in the US).1 star because the final assignment gives a lot of insight, although it's on the long side.",2
103077,"This course is the least content rich of the series, so far. Seemed basic to me, but maybe that's because my background is communication and content strategy.",1
103078,Great information that I would have never thought about.,5
103079,"Brilliant course, full of golden nuggets. Eric is a master at articulating the SEO / Social Media across and lessons are concise and to the point, with no mumbo jumbo jargon straight up plain English. You would be foolish to miss this if undertaking the specialization path.",5
103080,I really enjoyed Eric's style of instruction. Great course!,5
103081,I highly recommend this course for those who want to learn content marketing.,5
103082,Very good and complete course. A bit difficult for those of us who we were not very fond of Social Media before. Thanks Eric.,5
103083,Very interesting course!,5
103084,The lessons were very exciting and in-depth. I really learned a lot.,5
103085,Interesting and helpful content. Thanks！,5
103086,This is a Great SEO Course and I recommend it to every SEO specialist !,5
103087,Thanks to all the team and to the professor for this course.,5
103088,"I did not find this course as good as the other parts of the specialisation. There were some interesting elements there but also a lot of redundancy. I don't feel like I now have all the tools I need to do a through, structured content marketing analysis.",2
103089,Overall the course gives a general and broad perspective of content,5
103090,Great content and ideas. Thank you.,4
103091,"It was a pretty good course with great take away. Some of this take away might seem obvious for some people, but it's good to absorb them from an expert in the area!Some of the videos still need edition as they invite you to watch a video which is not embedded in the video, then the teacher starts talking about the video.....To enhance the course, I would recommend to correct the above and perhaps inviting other experts for some interviews to show to the audience.",4
103092,"Interesting but not much of the science behind it was included, personal choice, but I prefer more why with my what. Good tools.",3
103093,"Very Interesting course! Learnt a lot. But, Please can i suggest that the test part should be left open so as to effectively finish the course. Then people can choose to upgrade to receive certificate at the end of the course session.Thank you.",5
103094,"it's really helpful for how to manage weight by food intake, exercise and self-monitoring",5
103095,Most of the information in the course are available online but still this course will help you align and organize your diet and exercise,3
103096,"This course really helped me to come up with a great weight loss plan. I know the hard part is still in front of me, but I feel more confident now than I ever have embarking on a weight loss journey.",4
103097,I did this course but I wish to this amazing website to be less materialism :),5
103098,Good concept and such a true message. Hard to realize and for sure finally the only way to get slim and stay slim,4
103099,"The content was great and I found it very helpful, especially the actual scientific studies that backed the information. I was greatly annoyed at the requirement of having to purchase the course in order to do the homework and peer projects. I have never had to do that before and I have taken quite a few Coursera classes.",4
103100,"This is a very badly adjusted curse for the Coursera frame - I've encountered several quiz questions where I was supposed to write an answer in, but this option was not activated for me.Moreover, this course is dramatically prolonged - while the information provided can be easily put into 1-2 days, a week the most, it is somehow is stretched into 5 weeks. Taking into account that the course in a list of measures for a successful weight loss, it's justified to provide the strategies sooner in order to help those willing to start losing weight start doing that. The remaining 5 weeks would be great to help the students track their progress and get some peer-support.The system of not being able to submit any assignment or quiz until you pay for the course is vastly uncomfortable. the ability to self-check the weeks passed should be provided otherwise.The assignments for peer-grading are unnerving - how should peers grade my weight-goals? This is a direct ground for further body-shaming.The course is unfortunately very primitive and lacks further user-friendly design and review.",1
103101,"Very good information and resources provided. Unfortunately if you don't pay for the course you have no access to the assignments. This is the only course of several that I have taken where this is so. Surely, those non-paying students could still submit assignments, it is possible in other courses why not this one?",3
103102,gave me great insight.,5
103103,"I don't know if something as personal as weight loss should be a peer reviewed class. I didn't pay for the class so I wasn't involved in the peer review process. But in other classes I have taken and participated in the peer review process has shown that there are some who make it their goal to be as critical as possible, whether for the right or wrong reasons.",4
103104,Great course. It really helped me to stay disciplined about logging everything I put into my mouth. Just that little tip has helped me to self monitor and reduce the calories and increase the nutritional value of my meals and snacks.,5
103105,"This class was super helpful. Project based, with a logical, step-by-step plan to follow. I truly feel I have the tools I need now to succeed. Thanks so!",5
103106,"This is a good course, I would just do some things a little differently, for example, I don't agree with weighing oneself daily.",3
103107,"Thorough, gives you good tools to make a plan.",4
103108,"Good for a beginner. If you never read about weight loss anywhere, this course can help you. It provides the right guidance.",3
103109,This course provided me with lots of practical information and worksheets. The lectures were in depth and supplemented each lesson with case information to study that weeks topic in greater detail. I learned a lot and felt satisfied with the course.,5
103110,"No fancy jargon or exotic diets. Just a plain common sense approach to be more aware of what we eat and how active we are. Stresses the importance of a balanced diet. Assignments are really nice and reinforce the learning. Especially liked the ""Five Day Menu Assignment"" & ""Triggers That Get You Off Track"". I am very happy with the course and was able to lose 10 pounds over 5 weeks by an enhanced understanding of my calorie intake and outgo as also the right balance of foods. A big thanks to Professor Mary Beth Kavanagh and the Coursera Team for this course.",5
103111,"im always wanna know a new information and this give me more then just information. education me to make a better person and share with people here, love it...",5
103112,Very Effective,5
103113,"I think this information is very dated - Calories In/Calories Out, High Carb/Low Fat, recommending exercise to lose weight, vegetable oils recommended/animal fats denigrated . . . . so many recommendations that have little 'science' behind them, and which have not produced good results for 95% of the people who have used them. I've lost weight with a lower calorie diet and exercise, so, yes, it can work, but it is very difficult. I've kept it off easily for two years with a high fat/low carb eating plan. I've changed my exercise to mostly Pilates when my weight stabilized and I enjoy it enough to stay with it. knowing how difficult it is to stick to a low fat/high carb diet - which causes me to struggle with cravings, even when I am eating unprocessed organic seasonal local food - I hate to see a low fat diet recommended to people struggling with losing weight. I recommend ""The Big Fat Surprise"" and ""Good Calories, Bad Calories"" as an alternate view of healthy living.",2
103114,"Easy to understand, not radical, and sensible strategies for weight loss. No grapefruit diet here.",5
103115,Great Course to know more about soil management as well as sustainable farming. there are tonnes of great examples and best practices that can change way of soil management as well as farming.,4
103116,"The professor is an outstanding instructor with an interdisciplinary approach to agribusiness.Greetings,ECONOMICDEVELOPER.BJORN@ZOHO.COM",5
103117,Wharton！,5
103118,Professor is really thoughtful. Covers all of the questions that I have right after each part (with the help of the imaginary classmates). Really helpful. Love Professor's sense of humor. And I can see professor is a really experienced teacher in the accounting category.,5
103119,one of the best accounting courses I have ever taken!,5
103120,Fantastic course with humor knowledge learning journey~ Fully accepted this teaching model with lots of interaction and high quality post course exam.,5
103121,"I think the course is great - I would give it 5 stars. However, the instructor needs to develop better teaching skill. Each lesson is not clearly defined and he rambles on about aspects, which though interesting, have little or no bearing on the course objective.As well, many of the answers to the questions on the exams are not given in the lecture nor in the badly designed slides. Nor are the answers something that could be inferred from the lecture.It is a pity, because it is such an interesting topic.",2
103122,Great course by a great scientist.,5
103123,"Teacher I must say that I love your hairstyle, has a very gestural way of expressing everything you feel and know about the brain, I am not very good in English, but with you, what is not understood by language, is achieved with His gesture. Knowing that we have an inner universe, which colors the brain and sees how sipnasis is performed.",5
103124,simply about such complex system :),5
103125,"The best thing about the course was the acknowledgment that this is a highly interdisciplinary area and the emphasis on future research directions. The topics are covered by providing plenty of background explanation, though I found the repetition way too much at times. I would have liked to see the English in the slides, transcription of the videos, and most importantly, in the quizzes, proofread - at times, the seemingly small errors made it hard to understand what the quiz questions were about. A good introductory course all around. Thanks for your efforts!",4
103126,"A very complete course! I got a little confused with the mathematical part, but I understand everything better than before the course.Thank you so much!",5
103127,"extremely interesting course. aside from the lesson about electrical circuits which was a bit difficult for me to follow, the flow of the course was just amazing, i know so much more interesting things about the brain now than i knew before. kudos to Idan Segev for his astonishing lecturing skills, you have really inspired me to one day join you in the attempt to uncover the mysteries of the brain!",5
103128,amazing it was my first experience but it was amazing,4
103129,"Brilliant course, very well structured, clear and well-paced! Having previously worked on the Blue Brain Project as a Summer Research Assistant, I found this course most helpful and wish I had followed it earlier. Definitely looking forward to a follow-up course.",5
103130,"Idan Segev, the professor, is a really good teacher. His explanations are clear even for non english-speakers, he is a pedagog. The subject is well-presented, understandable and interesting. Pr.Segev makes your interest growing at every lesson.I really recommand this course even for those, like me, who have never done any bio or neuro- science in their life.",5
103131,"Excellent introductory course - well structured. Some areas are covered in more depth than I expected, and you need to concentrate, especially on some of the earlier modules. But that's a compliment - there's no point in doing a course that doesn't teach you anything.....",5
103132,Great introduction about the topic.,4
103133,Amazing course. Thank you!,5
103134,"Very good and advanced course. I have learned so much from this course and also established my strong interest in neuroscience,",5
103135,Very good introduction for people who are not in the professional domain of neuroscience.,5
103136,"This course is about computational neuroscience, it is not easy, and it requires knowledge and passion of mathematics and biophysics of neurons. If you are just interested in neuroscience but it is not your specialty (like me, a medical student), then this course is not beneficial for you.Prof. Segev is so knowledgeable and I think he tried his best to make easier but as I said it is difficult if you are just interested.",3
103137,"A nice overview of what science can tell us today about the brain, including some mathematical models and the technoligical advances that aid in the understanding of the brain. The teacher is very inspiring and obviously has a hart for the subject. I enjoyed this course very much!",5
103138,"Excellent, mind blowing course!!! I really liked it!!!And congratulations for the professor!! I love the way you present those complex concepts in such an easy way! Thanks!!!",5
103139,"This is as good a ciurse as I have had including all my live courses as an undergraduate and through my doctorate. This man really knows how to teach a complex course,",5
103140,Excellent delivery. Challenging but still accessible. Very interesting content. Highly rewarding experience.,5
103141,"Excellent!I liked very much this course!Although i would prefer to have more courses like this in spanish that is my native languaje, or at least with spanish subtitles.Thanks!",5
103142,Excellent but needed clearer visuals to aid in synthesizing the massive amount of information.,5
103143,Very great descripition and patienly explained by this excelent teacher!,5
103144,"The fast pace of knowledge been propagated at this time, places this course right at the top of this leap towards the near future.Thank you all for the kindness in making possible the absorption of this knowledge,All the best.A.Friszman",5
103145,easy following and interesting teaching style. I also like the presentations.,5
103146,Some interesting parts but quality of visuals poor and presentation suffered,3
103147,"The course is interesting but topics are sometimes way too difficult to follow through. Maybe the hardest is that there are few exercises during classes to test the given information, so the grading tests become really hard to pass.",2
103148,Great course!,5
103149,seems like an excellent review on the functioning of the brain at the axon/dendrite level.,4
103150,Great content and great professor.,5
103151,Thought-provoking !,5
103152,one of the best courses ever.,5
103153,Awesome experience after getting synapsed with Dr.Idan Segev's thoughts and amazing lectures. This course changed my spiking pattern entirely!!,5
103154,"Good teachers with amazing material, a fascinating journey to the neural science, yet simple enough to understand without much efforts.",5
103155,"The Course is Amazing and Professor Idan Segev is Amazing, i want to thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to learn this course and to learn from briliant person such as Idan segev, Best RegardsMax Freeman",5
103156,"Excellent learning opportunity. The material is interesting and well organized, and the instructor is clear and easy to understand. Practically speaking, it's very important to have an instructor who can speak and communicate well, and the instructor of this course does. I learned a lot from his lectures.",5
103157,"Brilliant course, with great instructors. Taken quite a number of online courses, but non was more simple, in a rather complicated course as this. kudos!",5
103158,"Wow!! What a great course, and a great lecturer.I recommend it for any one who find this subject interesting.",5
103159,"The course was fantastic!I just like to see more details for each of human senses.For example for the vision, speaking, hearing, listening, emotions.I know some problem are kinda solved and people got Nobel prize for that. It could be more interesting if you could tell us which problems are not solved yet and if become solved there would be a Nobel for that.In general, I love the course and the teacher! Thanks",4
103160,Excellent course content and teaching style. I would like to thank Prof. Segev and Prof. Nelken for introducing me to this exciting domain.,4
103161,Professor seemed patient as he carefully explained in extremely fine details which aided in lucid comprehension of the construction of the brain and neurons and the activities generated by synapses. I am extremely honored to be taught by Prof him and HUJ. Highly recommended for students who have an interest in Neuroscience and need to begin with the fundmentals.,5
103162,Very good introductory course for neuroscience. Highly recommended.,5
103163,"Really a great course! Covering a lot of details, but the most important point is that this course gives a big picture of different levels of understanding of the brain and minds. From the basic neural circuits to network models of computation, and high level cognitive tasks such as emotion, and the instructor even extended the course a little bit to cover some philosophical implications of brain research. By the way, Idan Segev is REALLY A GOOD INSTRUCTOR ! ! ! Thanks for this great course. Hope there may be something like a extended (advanced) version of it later on.",5
103164,Very comprehensive and interesting. Intellectually stimulating lectures and content. Some of the content was challenging but in an enjoyable way.,5
103165,Teaching is excellent . This is one of the best neurosciences class I've ever attended,5
103166,"I just watched the videos and didn't do any of the assignments. I had to skip the guest lecturer because I couldn't understand him, so that's the only reason I took off one star. If you are ok with reading what you can't listen to, then it would be 5 stars for the lectures.",4
103167,Great course but a lot of work! The work was well worth it though!!!!,5
103168,what a experience!,5
103169,Great course! I've wanted to learn some solid basics of neuroscience for years. This course is excellent for this purpose. Professor Segev is very enthusiastic about the subject and his lectures are very comprehensible.,5
103170,Very interesting and hard to study course! Nice up-to-date topics.,5
103171,very easily explained for all levels,5
103172,This course was very interesting and gave me new tools for developing my musical career which is now focused in the field of neuromusic. Thanks a lot !!!,5
103173,Very interesting,5
103174,sir i am very sorry i didn't do even wok because my college timing so disturbing me i kindly say to you my apology and i want your context you always connect to my whatsapp number sir if i have any doubt i say you and my new think and invention even i have to show you,5
103175,"It is an amaizing course! Just with the info, I'm mostly interested in. I participated in other courses too, concerning the brain at Coursera and at other organisations too, from the best universities, but it is better, one of the 2 best courses. Thank you very much.",5
103176,"Broad overview, many historical aspects and some time dedicated to new discoveries. As a total novice in the field I found it really interesting. Sometimes the assignments aren't focused on understanding but at memorizing (useless?) details.",4
103177,Fantastic course. The instructor is a clear speaker and introduces some basic concepts in neuroscience very nicely. The quizzes are also well written and reinforce the concepts introduced in the lectures.,5
103178,It is a brilliant introduction to brain science. Recommend to all who are interested in brain and cognition!,5
103179,The content is really good but the test questions are very theoretical. They dont test the understanding but the learning capacity of the student.,3
103180,Just a great course.,5
103181,beautifully tailored :),5
103182,awesome... i would like spanish subtititles only .,5
103183,"concise and integrated organization, complex concepts wrapped up in short direct sentences, no reasoning is needed for the students because everything makes sense directly. Startling slide show in the background very content rich and a lot of work to put it together, he can make a 15 min material easily digested in 5 min for the students.",5
103184,This is a wonderful course. This course brings you from basic information about brain to quite novel research approaches and topics regarding the human (or generally mammal) brain. This all is done in very understandable way. I'm looking forward to see more courses from Hebrew University and specifically from Idan Segev.Thank You.,5
103185,"The course is interesting much to be learned and topics are open to much discussion. Some of the presentation need to be simplified and shortened. Repetitions tend to lose emphasis of the main ideas. Additional literature is welcome. But, to those of us whom love science and specially 'Brain mysteries' this course is a different perspective from those physiological or pathophysiological brain courses. Theoretical ideas of the brain are not easy topics; but it does make an interesting discussion. Thanks for the effort and the course is appreciated.",3
103186,"excellent class to begin,",5
103187,"I love this course. I'm failing all the quizzes because I don't have the maths, but I get the concepts and for my purposes that's enough.",5
103188,"Im so thankful for you and this great instructor for giving people who are not a degree intelligent, likeike me, the exes to such a beautiful important knowledge! shira",5
103189,a very clear an simple lecturer,4
103190,"The video Lectures are informative,precise and to the point.",5
103191,"Intense, interesting, very passionate professor. I have to admit I felt at times quite challenged, but overall a very satisfying course",4
103192,the best teacher I ever met in 50 year of study...I wish one day I can meet You. Thanks for Your wanderful teaching,5
103193,"Lections are good except it was quite hard to listen the guest lecturer. The material was interesting, but the form and the way he said the information was difficult for me.Quizzes are not very informative, and sometimes seem to be too tricky without any value to this trickiness.Big thanks to Idan for this course.",4
103194,"Awesome material. The Concepts are well explained. Only downside in my opinion are the lectures slides, which could have a cleaner look.",5
103195,"This course was good, but the videos presented kept breaking down or stopping in the middle of the lecture. It was hard to focus or learn anything properly.",5
103196,A great course. Very thorough and first of all up to date!,5
103197,a bit labored at times which makes most lesson longer than might otherwise be.Patient teacher who is keen on his subject and tries very hard to teach in great details,4
103198,"I've enjoyed this course a lot. The host is very entertaining and expains everything in great detail. The course itself encompasses a tremendous amount of useful and relevant information on how brain works. I've got a lot out of this course.The only drawback I came across is some ambiguity of quiz-questions. Not always clear what is asked, apart from that everything is perfect. Thanks a lot for enlightening me!",5
103199,Motivated！,5
103200,I didn't expect all that math and equations in a course about the brain. But it was quite informative nontheless.,3
103201,Worth the time put in.,5
103202,Amazing course.Wonderful scientist teaching.Course should be open all the time for the people to take up any time and learn.,5
103203,"Very thorough and clear. I am from psychology background and I was expecting to have a lot of difficulty in understanding it, however I found the course really helpful. Even the maths and physics portions were only slightly difficult.",5
103204,excelent teacher,5
103205,This course is perfect for novices. Idan Segev is a great teacher; I look forward to participate in another course lectured by him.,5
103206,"I have always enjoyed learning about the brain - yet I've never thought I could learn so much through this course. Hebrew University of Jerusalem gave me the chance to dig deeper in the brain, and I have gained so much about the brain, neurons and synapses through the course. It was challenging, yet really fulfilling experience for me and I am so glad that I have taken this course. Thanks everyone who made this course possible, and because of their hard work and patience. Thank you!",5
103207,It is a very interesting and well-done course about neurobiology. Prof. Sedev has many interactive tasks and he tries to explain details as easy as possible. All in all it is understandable.,5
103208,one of the nicest coursera classes I've taken so far,5
103209,"Prof. Idan Segev taught the course with an understanding that he will have an audience from a variety of backgrounds and hence the course was balanced between mathematical and biological concepts. His enthusiasm regarding the topics he taught was what got me gripped and as a Physics major thinking about a career in biophysics, the biophysical concepts he taught (Hodkin-Huxley model, Rall's model, concepts in computational neuroscience) made me ever more interested in my career choice.Thumbs up to Prof. Segev and his team for a truly inspiring and enjoyable course! Hope you do other courses in the future.",5
103210,I like this course. It is worth listen to it to the end.,5
103211,"Fascinating course, well taught. One of my favorite life long learning adventures.",5
103212,too more recapitulations/ but very good lextures,4
103213,liked this course so mush ..full of great informations ! ..it's realy great course,5
103214,Wonderful course!!!! It was amazingly easy to understand synapses!,5
103215,very simple teaching with condensed materials.thank you for all helping us to watch and participate in this course.only one point that should be taken in consideration. why i cannot obtain statement of accomplishment even i pass all exams. why there is only statement with verification,4
103216,This course is very beautifully organized and Prof. Idan Segev is very good teacher.Tak tak tak tak tak .....Brain Demystified!!!A must course for those who want to learn Computational Neuroscience.,5
103217,Excellent lecture on neurons & synapses - building block of the brain.,5
103218,Dear ProfessorOne of the best courses online particularly in Neurotechnology!Got to work really hard !Thank youRabinder Henry,5
103219,i am not a guy who goes well with mathematic equations besides that this course is really valuable. God bless,4
103220,"I found this course to be extremely engaging and taught in greater depth than I have initially presumed. My first plan was to finish this course in ten days, but I realized that it would be a waste to rush and try to finish it as planned instead of grasping better the information so beautifully presented.Mr. Idan Segev is a great teacher, one that I wished to have had in my biology class. Although the mathematical and physics aspect of the course were a challenge for me, after some individual study and great help from the discussion thread I can say that I got a good grasp of what this course had to teach.As a 11th grade student, this course opened my eyes in regard to the latest technologies, international projects, and ideas pursued by world-wide scientists. I plan to apply for a degree in Neuroscience, and what I have learned here only strengthen my desire to do so, which I can not thank enough for.In the future, I am looking forward to new courses about the beauty of the brain and I genuinely hope that Mr. Idan Segev will decide to make other courses such as this one.",4
103221,Excellent and engaging course addressing the subject matter from a different perspective from other neurobiology courses available on Coursera.,5
103222,Quite organized and easy-understood! It's really helpful~,4
103223,Awsome and Useful.,5
103224,"That's terrible! I can't see any English subtitles added to this course. Besides, tests are not relevant to the content taught in the video.",1
103225,Great Course! Motivate me to have passion to finish it!,5
103226,I like this course.It teached me something I like,4
103227,The courses helps me a lot and thank the teacher very much.,5

103244,I am so grateful for this course. It has been very helpful in my job as a volunteer in a non-profit organization. Thank you so much.,5
103245,"I found the course design with its mix of teaching materials, videos, the peer assessed essays, quizzes and the series of valuable questions provided for reflection, both stimulating and effective in helping my learning process. The course syllabus was comprehensive and well panned over the six weeks and would like to thank Dr Malakolunthu and Prof MacBeath for bring this subject to life.",5
103246,Very informative. I have learnt a lot,4
103247,This was an informative class and I learned things that I am using to help shape my professional outlook.,4
103248,"For people with a teaching qualification contains a lot of things you may already know, even though, I have learnt some very interesting concepts that definitely will have an impact on my teaching strategy and approach. So recommendable for any audience, no matter how experience you think you are.",5
103249,"This is a great opportunity for a better understanding on how teachers, students, and society put into practice the curriculum that would finally shape teaching in the classroom.",5

103255,Absolutely Amazing Content! I loved it!I learned so much my head is spinning!Thank you Professor John M. and Professor Suseela M. for a lovely course!,5
103256,"Proof reading needed, for the slides and for the quizzes. Overall, this is a low content course delivered in a rather boring and uninformative way.",2
103257,"Horrible quiz questions. I found the distractors to be too similar to the answer, what is the point in having 4 possible correct answers?",2
103258,The quiz questions were not clear enough sometimes.,3
103259,It is a great course!,5
103260,"That's an amazing course for us Chinese students to improve English speaking skills. It's not only about pronunciation and intonation, but also teach us how to use global perspective.",5
103261,poor quality and even worse presentation by the teacher,1
103262,"I have some suggestions:1. Use consistent English throughout the course due to this is an English class.2. one ""upload"" button is enough in the assignment . . . so it doesn't confuse people3. Specify the minimum grade to pass the assignment if it 80%, then say 80% . . .However, overall the course is good, and I love learning other culture! Kind of a new experience for me. Thank you very much! ^_^ Xie Xie . . .",3
103263,"It's amazing course, although it will be better, if he speaks only in English or use English subtitles when he explains in Chinese.",5
103264,"The course is good but it has too much Chinese, and I'm not Chinese.",3
103265,In this course I have learned more than I learned in my regular English Courses. Excellent.,5
103266,"I learned a lot of useful information, thanks",4
103267,The teacher talk much about his own experiences.,4

103274,"Great Introductory Course to VC. Mr. Xu, together with other teachers in this course, explains everything clearly. Strongly recommended.",5
103275,Great. That's exactly what I need. I am starting a new company now.,5
103276,pretty good,4
103277,This is a good start up course to learn about tinkering fundamentals.,3
103278,It's a interesting approach about how to teach and to learn in STEAM subjects.,5
103279,This course contained excellent invitations to open up tinkering-type thinking and hands on work. I appreciated the connections between tinkering and art. Working through the course activities increased my confidence and understanding.,4
103280,"This course started out with an ambitious goal for a MOOC in forming groups to work collaboratively on a social enterprise project. I found the level of interaction in the group forming forum underwhelming and immediately lost interest due to concerns that the level of interaction would only continue to diminish as the course went on. I still made an attempt to watch the course content, but found the instructor speaking more about what he planned to cover rather than actually covering anything of substance. Two stars for quality video production. Aside from that, I was unable to find much value.",2
103281,"As a business management student with a strong interest in this matter, I found the course really useful for those who are rather begginers in this subject.",5
103282,"I am very thankful for this course, as I am at the beggining of starting my own Sociale Enterprise. It made it possible for me to see the social problem as a whole and not focused only on the business idea that I had already in my mind. So eventually, my idea got even better, thanks to the learnings and exercises from this MOOC. I am looking forward to learn more in the follwing courses of this specialisation. I am sure its gonna be a remarkable added value to my venture! And finally thanks very much for the many many precious optional readings! Good luck to everyone else who wishes to start a Social Enterprise. I highly recomand this course!",5
103283,Wish that there would be more insight in social entrepreneurial opportunitiesDifficult to find a group and have a platform for discussion. The discussion forum does not work as intended. There is too much noise.They course instructors should provide more information to begin with that it is essential to watch the videos and read the course material almost before the new week starts because of the fact that groups needs to be created and discussions and research with teammates have to be coordinated. It all seems rushed and not rewarding.I do not think that my outcome of this course has been significant because of the structure of the course and I regret that I have paid for all 3 courses.,2
103284,"It is a very well constructed course, even for someone that has no experience in entrepreneurship. Working in groups online it's quite challenging though.",5
103285,I like that I could collaborate with other students.,5
103286,"I loved this course and is showing to be very useful to build up my own startup. Also, I have met GREAT collegues on the MOOC and we will continue to collaborate!",5
103287,"The Mooc was amazing! I really enjoyed to connect with people from all over the world; all the assignments gave me the task to improve my English skills as well as vocabulary, my group was incredible; we still talk and help each other in our endeavours!",5
103288,Excellent course by an excellent university and staff.,5
103289,"It is a great course for introduction about identifying social entrepreneurship opportunities. They show you some organizations, what they do, how they were created and so on through interviews. They also provide links and interseting documents where you can get additional information. It is also good because you can interact with other students, their projects and ideas. I miss a few things like giving you tools and social business plans but I believe that they will come in the next courses.",4
103290,I believe we could have had more analysis information,4
103291,I really liked this program because it was somehow different with other TOEFL programs.,5
103292,It was indeed a great course.,5

103294,"A great course, with amazing insights into real-world trading based on solid evidence-based research",5
103295,Very good course on introducing trading mentality,5
103296,The course was ok. Some of the answers in the practise quiz were wrong.,4
103297,"I liked the content that was presented. There was some really good advice, like the importance of being disciplined in sticking to the algorithm you have designed. Unfortunately there was no detail at all about how to backtest, where to get data for backtesting, where to find research papers upon which to base an algorithm, etc. In other words, everything was kept at a very abstract level, and not enough detail was provided to actually do anything.",2
103298,Covered the basics on how to trade in the markets using the fundamentals,5
103299,"The course is excellent, but there is mistakes in quiz and the forum participation is null. Professor nor your staff reply the forums.",3
103300,Very good course with teaching the way to learn how to trading and learning trading algorithms.,5
103301,"Course material and contents are quite interesting but, grading system specially peer review method is absolutely disappointing and kills the motivation. Grading level by other students somehow looks insulting regarding the time and effort which I put to think, write, explain and make videos.",2
103302,good course,5
103303,Good introduction if there is no knowledge about Human centered Design. I think it could have more practice about the topics we saw.The explanations of the professor were very clear and understandable.,4
103304,"Dr. Maital, thank you, thank you very much for helping me and helping the world to have a better lives, for teaching us to have empathy and to think on others living do not matter the race, the continent or the country. I am now learning the ZIZOZI system, and would recommend it to my sons or to everybody.",5
103305,Very good course and professors.,5
103306,"Sorry, but the course is very poor. I've watched all the videos of the first week and it's mostly about nothing. And, by the way, too much stories. And I'm still wondering why simpke brainstorming is called ZiZoZi (""new"" approach as it described).",1
103307,It was a very wonderful course to take. Am so grateful,5
103308,"Much blaba, lenghty lectures, but less delivery/content. The second course (from idea to startup) is much better.",2
103309,I like the course. It broke down things that you could implement to give you more ability to be more creative. I will someday buy the course.,5
103310,The lectures were very interesting and full of valuable information. I tried another creativity course and preferred this approach much more. I would recommend this course to anybody.,5
103311,"We were presented a totally new approach to innovation and entrepreneurship, which was very interesting and inspiring. Prof. Shlomo Maital provides us with an impuls to go through an experience and transformation stages (as per Gilmore and Pine II).Mr. Professor ! Thanks for spending time with us and sharing your knowledge and wisdom.",4
103312,"Creatively inspiring, great content to reflect and practice upon and great innovation spark, thanks to Prof. Shlomo Maital & Arie Ruttenberg for delivering this creative experience and knowledge.",5
103313,"Thank you Prof. Shlomo Maital, I like this course a lot",5
103314,Wonderful course!!,5
103315,"This course ""talks"" about a really important subject. - that is probably one of its key benefits.I got really passionate and worked hard on the theme, and after completing I felt that It did not gave or matched the expectations on the course name/subject .Benefits:1)Important theme ( within business context) discussed with good videos and references2)Historical perspective on Creativity is sound3)Prof. Shlomo Maital is a warm, highly informed and passionate person about the subject.4)The course in week 2 and 3 makes you think on your one key creativity processesAnd it almost stops there since the purpose of the course gets flawed by the lack of requirements in the peer review, supporting materials and forum ""health"" that is why the course talks does fail in training/ teaching.Key points to not advice this course - at least in the paid version - see until n.51) Lack of support materials2) Support based on the ZIZOZI book to be bought outside of the course cost3)Reading of the ZIZOZI book in the context of the course ( with some answers to the quizzes being in the book and not in the course material)4) Dive into very interesting methods made only superficially ( Da Vinci Method, IDEO pex) with needs to be explained further.5) Complete or near complete lack of requirements for the classification of the peer review, making it very flawed ( see the definition of scalability per example and how to rank it)6) Forum use and reply almost near nullnessI do expect this course to be revised deeply in its execution. ( See per example Agile from Darden to benchmark).",1
103316,This course has inspired me greatly and filled me with the energy I needed! I look forward to the rest of the course!Toda raba Prof. Maital!!,5
103317,"Great course! I did the 'informal' version, without assignments. Schlomo is a very creative person, who tries to make us more creative as well. Thanks for all the background information! I can see now that our traditional education system might not be the best way to learn..",5
103318,"Extremely repetitive with little to no visual interest. Needs to be cut down to about one tenth the presentation time. There are no visual representations, no exercises and no interactivity.This is the most repetitive MOOC I have ever taken and I've taken a great many.",1
103319,Highly informative and creative. It is a mind opening course into looking at the the world with more possibilities.,5
103320,Excellent Thanks,5
103321,the course is an eye opener and highly inspiring.,4
103322,"The creative process has always intrigued me, and this course will help get beyond any stuckness you may feel.",5
103323,Good! I have learnt alot about creativity from the lesson.,5
103324,Professor Shlomo Maital is brilliant!,4
103325,"Really excellent Course with the great educators. There's a lot that can be learned in this course and applicate in everyday life, especially if you are teacher who transferred knowledge to students.",5
103326,Professor Maital brings to us amazing insights about creativity based both on research and real cases.,5
103327,"Interesting subject, and well-produced videos.The assignments are however arbitrary and ill-defined, leading to wildly different peer reviews and many who have completed the assignments correctly to be stuck in a grading limbo.Would not recommend at this point",3
103328,This course is very helpful in one's quest to be more creative. The ZiZoZi method is very practical.,5
103329,"The course is interesting but at the same time quite repetitive. There are many examples in it, but they are all high level examples which are not really going into the details of the creative process.The high level process proposed is good, but it is into the details where the processes fails, and there are no detailed examples here.By far, the worst thing related to this course is the peer review. they define rules which nobody respects and the scoring system is subjective and badly defined. I really regret my decision to join this specialization and the waist of money.",1
103330,Amazing vision of creativity! Really worth!,5
103331,Repeats the same information over and over,1
103332,This is very good course in creative thinking!,5
103333,"Although some aspects were repetitive, I do enjoy learning from the many stories of creative problem solving.",4
103334,"While I appreciate this class for attempting to tackle a complicated topic, it was too hard for me to follow, and the peer assignment grading rubric is too arbitrary. Perhaps it is designed for those who are more analytical than myself.. Such as developers... (I am a writer). Although I liked the topic, I will not be taking more classes with this instructor.",2
103335,"Great information, given over in an easy to digest and interesting way.",5
103336,a course I have been looking forward to for such a long time!,5
103337,I love this key.,5
103338,"Not really well produced for the media. Too much instruction of the teacher, few practice instead.",1
103339,"as i've gone through the first week of the archived version of this course , i felt that Prof. (Emeritus) Shlomo Maital is doing his best to make the course unique , when they lunched the paid version i immediately applied in it because it suits me and because i have confidence in the content",4
103340,The content is good but the delivery is not engaging or creative enough.,2
103341,The course is over loaded with extremely long videos. Otherwise it is an excellent course.,4
103342,"Excellent intro!, very interesting.!",5
103343,"The content is really an interesting topic that I'm sure a lot of learners with enjoy. However, the way it is presented needs a lot of work. First, the slides are not masterfully made; proper word count and transitions are not applied. Second, the length of the lessons are not conducive to learning, it needs to be trimmed to shorter lessons or even be cut. Third, it is repetitive and there's too much focus on the unnecessary, the lecture needs to be reviewed. Cracking the creativity code is an interesting topic. However, the lessons were not presented creatively enough.",3
103344,I'm so far very impressed with this course series and I'm so excited to dicover,5
103345,The course is very interesting but sometimes is too fast on difficult steps,4
103346,A good course with thorough knowledge of the basic terminology required for trading,5
103347,Very happy with this course! It was easy to follow with a good mix of theory and examples.,5
103348,"One of the best lecture series for beginners like me. Some of the statistical concepts should have been explained better, but once you get past that, you appreciate the logic in the trading system.",3
103349,A general brief about how you can make calculated and broad assumptions on the tock market. Not a specialized course but is helpful in getting the basics.,4
103350,Very factual. Hard to grasp and follow.,3
103351,"The course is excellent, but there is mistakes in quiz and the forum participation is null. Professor nor your staff reply the forums.",3
103352,Amazing course. Highly relevant for the fundamental knowledge of markets and trading in them.,5
103353,A bit complex topics for just an introductory course.Nevertheless interesting explanation on CAPM and ABT.,3
103354,"the technicalities are not elucidated by giving practical examples in simple terms. For example, the FAMA FRENCH model has been explained thoroughly but not told how to apply in real market. Also , how to calculate the expected returns from a stock has been taught using beta , but whats the duration of the returns if one buys the stock in the middle of the year.( for example I calculate returns of a stock Q using CAPM and I get 15%, then how should I interpret this in the real market scenario where I am investing in the middle of the fiscal year.",3
103355,"Although it delves into key elements of trading where it really matters, course lacks explanation on some subjects. Course progresses monotonously.",3
103356,Its a very superficial course. It feels like the instructor is just reading out from some material. And it is not making it interesting to listen. The instructor is not putting in much effort to make student understand the concept. That's the reason for me to drop out in between the course. This course is not at all much informative and neither it is improving my grasp on the topic.,1
103357,"Good insights and must for a person who is seriously interested in trading ,Any one with a zero knowledge of finance can also take this course.",5
103358,"The course is really interessant, I will like more practical examples to complement the theory.",3
103359,Kind of hard to follow. Explanation is,2
103360,The course was pretty good. Also the examples used while explaining various concepts were very helpful while trying to understand.,4
103361,"A little bit shallow, but beginners-friendly",4
103362,"Skillful instructor, but terrible technical setup, and plenty of faults in the lecture slides in the videos. Also the audio-quality is poor.",3
103363,Great course!,5
103364,The worse course ever,1
103365,"This was hard, but I was happy and the end and have a good grade. Thank to my classmates , thank to ESSEC",5
103366,"I would not recommend this specialization to anyone. The first assignment is just a first review of the final project, but it is almost impossible to pass, because the questions are not organized in a manner of constructive feedback.",1
103367,"The course is related with language and logical analysis , so it's a little hard to learn because my English is very poor.",4
103368,"this course is comprehensible, interesting and so useful for me comprehensible",5
103369,Excellent course! The education didactics is really well organized and easy to follow through even for a nonenglish native as myself. At the same time is gradually challenging. I'm really grateful to Professor Dr. Walter Sinnott-Armstrong for sharing his amazing knowledge with such passion. I believe that this course will influence my life in a long therm basis and I look forward to beginning part II.,5
103370,An excellent introduction to the valuable skill of understanding arguments. The lectures are entertaining and provide a welcoming style for learners of all backgrounds. The content is not light but is well-structured and the pacing is generous - one hour a day of study should more than suffice. I thank the creators for an edifying and enjoyable experience.,5
103371,it helped me understand argument and analyse it for better understanding,5
103372,"English is my second language, sometimes is not easy to understand ""arguments"", since the introduction of this course I understand different ways to clarify points of view without arguing or fighting. It was easy, fun and it makes me feel more confident when I talk to others and when they explain me some important things about many concerns. Thanks!",5
103373,"Although I had some background ""noise"" that made this course challenging, it was a good learning experience! The professors made it interesting.",5
103374,Well done. Thank you.,5
103375,it's very good.,5
103376,No complaints. This course revealed im more interested in the interpersonal dynamic of influence and persuasion vs the logic of arguments.,4
103377,Could not finish the course. I found the course to be boring.,1
103378,Great course for people trying to excels themselves in critical analysis of arguments and debate,5
103379,"I found this course to be very interesting. I certainly gained a better understanding of arguments, my own shortcomings and steps I can take to improve/put into practice. Thank you.",4
103380,This course is awesome! I really appreciate the time and effort devoted to make this course such a great introduction to critical thinking!,5
103381,"Easy to understand,",5
103382,Very engaging lecturer for what could be a very dry subject.In depth analysis and examples,4
103383,A perfect course to lay the foundation to the understanding of arguments used in daily lives.,5
103384,"Interesting, informative course presented in a clear, comprehensive and fun way! Congratulations and THANK YOU!",5
103385,"This is a very very engaging and applicable course, and is truly presented with 10/10 efficacy! I couldn't be more sincere and adamant in my recommendation, no matter who you are or what you do.",5
103386,"Very interesting, great lecturer",5
103387,Very educational and eye opening.,5
103388,"Absolutely amazing!What a great course, very practical, with many exercises. The lectures are fun and engaging. The textbook is a useful tool to get more details and extra exercises. One of the best MOOCs that I've ever taken.",5
103389,"Great course, well-structured, clear and fun. One little reservation: introducing arguments by saying what they are not may make it difficult for students to understand the distinction between arguments as such and the various functions they can have (a topics which is covered later in the course.)",5
103390,Top Class,5
103391,Thank you very much for this course. It helps to understand more clearly the arguments and to be more wise in the art of disputes.,5
103392,Brilliant course! I learned so much about how to evaluate arguments and pick them apart to understand the reasoning process behind them. I have been looking for a course just like this for ages and I am so glad I finally found it! Highly recommended.,5
103393,"I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who would like to better understand arguments. Not only is it helpful in general, but especially helpful in the workplace. Being able to form a logical, sound and validating argument is important when leading and working towards a greater good.",5
103394,An experience fascinating!!!,5
103395,"Weekly quizzes instead of just the final (that actually counts for a grade) would be very helpful to me, but it was a great course and I learned a lot!",4
103396,Thanks a lot! It's a very nice course. This is very helpful to understand about an Argument.,5
103397,"The decision to divide the original course into four distinctive courses is ingenious! I laud the way the information is presented and illustrated with many diverse examples. I find the professor to be very goofy in a positive way.I recommend the course to anyone really, especially college students, undergrads to be more precise. I am a philosophy undergrad and I am already familiar with many of the topics, and most humanities students know a thing or two about logic, but students from other disciplines can benefit from this even more.In dark times such as these, where the likes of Trump rule the world we would benefit more than ever from young people that would judge and rationalize more efficiently!",5
103398,It changed my thinking and behavior totally. It's a must learn for everyone from my side to the one who seeks knowledge.,5
103399,Very thoughtful to not exclude me even when I did not hand in homework on time:),5
103400,A great logic course for beginers.,5
103401,Simply the best online course I've taken!,5
103402,I loved the course and I want to take the othe,4
103403,The course was really useful! And I would also like to outline the charismatic teacher who inspired to learn smth new!,5
103404,Extremely fun and useful. I loved it.,5
103405,"I devoured this course -- Walter's presentations and examples work for me. And I loved the multi-layered tie-dye look for that one lecture about halfway through! But seriously: being able to break an argument down, understand how it is constructed, and assess its validity and soundness are all really important.",5
103406,Great course; highly informative. Good teaching that makes the subject easy to understand.,5
103407,"Although it's a bit hard for me to deeply understand the lectures, it's very helpful for me. I shall review it one more time. I like the way professor Walter Sinnott-Armstrong presents his lectures. He is a humorous and admirable teacher.",5
103408,"An excellent course for students that require, or want intricate detail on the subject. Not really designed for casual interest, more likely for the philosophy major. Presented very clearly and the discussions and material were interesting. Would have been four stars but the final quiz was excessively difficult.",3
103409,Easy to understand and fun. Professor explains concepts thoroughly. Would Highly recommend,5
103410,LOVED this course!! Loved professor's engaging ways to explain complicated concepts in logic,5
103411,Great Course !!! Thank you very much,5
103412,"An excellent course, but it is hard going (took me 3 attempts to get through the final quiz!). Recommend for anyone interested in how people present arguments.",4
103413,Nice and valuable course because you learn effectively the theory about how to argue.,5
103414,One splendid course ! I thoroughly enjoyed taking it and look forward to the next part of it.,4
103415,"I think the professor is clear an concise (I know, the word ""clear"" is not easy to define). The content is very interesting, and definitely relevant. It might be so that I won't use EVERYTHING I learned here in my daily life, but I definitely have tools to provide better arguments, and debate other people's arguments.Some parts of the course are heavy, but with a little bit of effort and dedication, one can follow.",5
103416,Thank you so much to my Professors. I've learned a lot.,4
103417,A systematic course on how to understand arguments!,5
103418,An excellent course that everyone should take. It teaches you how to organize arguments so that you can see the faults and the underlying morals behind them.,5
103419,The professor really inspired me of critical thinking. The professor is knowledgeable and humorous. I'll certainly suggest my classmates to take this course.,5
103420,This course goes super in depth on how arguments work. I learned things in this course that'd I'd never heard of before and it gave me a more critical view on how people say things.,5
103421,Great course!!,5
103422,This course's been a fantastic journey in informal logic and critical thinking. The lectures are very interesting and Walter Sinnott-Armstrong is a fantastic teacher. Thank you very much for this course,5
103423,"Much harder than I anticipated and some of the concepts were difficult for me to grasp. However, I think it just takes practice! Interesting and in depth look at how arguments are formed and work. Thanks!",5
103424,"Interesting course. It seems to me that we have been learning to play scales before going into music, or learning the names of the letters before learning to read. I wonder how much of all this word by word analysis is useful in real life, real arguing. It is interesting, but it also adds to the difficulty and prompts abandon of the course. Like having to memorize the Periodic Table of Elements before going into the wonders of Chemistry. The Suzuki Method in music or the Silabario Matte (to learn reading in Spanish, starting directly with basic words like ""ojo""=""eye""), show that starting with structural analysis it isn't the only way to learn things.",4
103425,I do enjoy the course through interaction with other participants and like to express my sincere gratitude to Coursera and Duke University.,4
103426,I love this course and would like to do it again!,5
103427,"This is one of the better courses on Cousera. The instructors are passionate, the material is challenging, but well explored and it is one of the most practical courses on logic as it talks about how to form and interpret practical arguments.The only real downside is lack of interaction from mentors/ta's in the forum.",4
103428,Excellent course. Opened my mind to this fascinating subject!I have an Electrical Engineering graduation so the logics part wasn't so hard as I studied it in Computer linguistic. Happy to apply that in everyday texts and speeches.,5
103429,"I do not want to rate this course at this stage but I would like to make the following comment in relation to the course resources and in particular the answers to the exercises in the optional text book.For students who do not have a copy of the text book, providing answers to questions from the text book without showing the actual questions is not very useful and to be quite frank, ridiculous. I would like to think that the course designers would take some sort of appropriate action to remedy this.How exactly this would be done is up to the course designers but I would suggest that another downloadable PDF document showing all the questions would be extremely useful and necessary.I look forward to a response.Regards, Trevor Farley",1
103430,Excellent = rating based on completion of week 1,5
103431,A wonderful lesson that many of us should take a look and learn it! It's a lesson to understanding why.,5
103432,This is one of the best courses I've taken to date through Coursera. The course content is useful in all walks of life and the instructor is thorough and engaging. I would highly recommend this course to everyone interested in looking for ways to structure better arguments.,5
103433,Excellent and informative.,5
103434,Very useful!!!,5
103435,"I am 3 weeks into the course and can categorically say that it one of the best courses I have ever taken. Besides the professor's impeccable knowledge, his amazing command over fluid teaching is admirable. I really like the content where the learners are taught how to dissect (and construct) an argument for a broad range of areas where they might find its use.People who are thinking of taking it, make sure you commit at least 5 hours every week. Absorb and enjoy!",5
103436,"Hoping that the next sections won't be so laborious and focussed on analyzing texts in detail. If you want to know how to do such things, then this would be a 5-star course for you.",3
103437,"Dr. Sinnott-Armstrong does an amazingly thorough and detailed job, and the progression of the course is well planned and well executed.I wanted to give the course a higher rating, but unfortunately, the good doctor's explanatory skills only served to confuse and frustrate me, the further I progressed through the course. Extemporaneous examples were unintentionally and unnecessarily muddled. There were numerous misspoken or confused terms that could easily have been re-recorded or edited. And the splicing between the old course and the new one is sometimes discontinuous (though, to be fair, they warn us about that at the beginning).Nevertheless, I would still highly recommend the course to anyone looking for a thorough-going university-level course in critical thinking, and basic argumentation.",3
103438,Presented in an entertaining style. I especially enjoyed the detailed analysis of a newspaper article after presentation of the basic concepts. It nicely brought together all that we had learnt in the previous weeks as well as illustrate how it could be applied in 'real' world/everyday situations.,5
103439,I was impressed!,5
103440,Great course!,5
103441,Excellent! Perfect for new managers and those with in depth training that need best practices for dealing with issues on the front line.,5
103442,Very interesting course! Thank you very much!,5
103443,"A good introduction for ""beginners"", aka people who are not involved, educated or interested in public health, healthcare. Alternatively, seek another course because it is very simple.",3
103444,"Excellent! it is easy, practical an simple. Love it.",5
103445,"clear instruction, a very good course for beginner to learn SEM.",5
103446,Good But slowly repeated times,4
103447,It is may which coming to Doctor way.,4
103448,"This course really brings security and privacy to life. It connects the technically detailed 'how' of the other courses (cryptography, software and hardware security) with the why. More importantly it helps us make informed choices when designing, and helps us identify the real options.",5
103449,"Great course, I loved the examples and video of practices throughout the learning!",5
103450,A very fascinating and enjoyable course! I would highly recommend this to anyone wanting to take the first step in learning about cybersecurity.,4
103451,Awesome concepts to include in our daily infosec,5
103452,"I found this course very interesting. Even if I already have some knowledge of security in general, I was very happy to follow this course and go in details about all aspect of usable security. Lessons are very clear and easy to understand. I will go forward with other security courses.",5
103453,"A shame it is part of the cybersecurity specialization. It is boring and full of obvious-psicology things like ""passwords need to be secure but easy to remember"". The instructor, at least, seems to have zero knowledge about software development. Everything we did in seven weeks could have been taught in one or two.",1
103454,"Very interesting course, good material",5
103455,I learned the psychology of implementing security systems.,4
103456,"Excellent course, well explained. Not too much things to learn at once. Ideal when you want to start. Would be useful to have also a slide deck next to it for the review and exam preparation.",4
103457,Liked the structure of the course and the way concepts have been integrated with real life practical examples. Would have loved to understand some examples or references to 'design thinking' consideration of some specific industry problems - like building a payments system or a ticketing system etc.,5
103458,"There are many parts of the lectures that are very quiet and even with my speakers turned to max, I struggled to hear, while other parts were clear. The course is interesting, but I doubt that anyone would pay to attend this course.",2
103459,"I strongly recommend this course to all security software developers, managers and of course to designers.",5
103460,"Very good, excellent course",5
103461,Cool !,5
103462,Thanks for the course. it's very useful for my present job :).,5
103463,"would be nice if you could see the questions and answers after you take a quiz or exam, that way its easier to lean where you went wrong on a question.",4
103464,Nice course with more important info,4
103465,thanks alot,5
103466,"Best course to learn about usable security, If you are familiar with Human Computer Interaction then easily can related the security issue in between Human and Machine.",4
103467,Well organized. Material is well presented and relevant.,5
103468,"I am having a very difficult time finishing this course. I find the topic dull and the content uninteresting. It is the first course of the CyberSecurity Specialization .. I hope the other courses are not like this.I rated it one star for a couple of reasons.1- I have been in software for many years and I know about software design. I would NOT have expected to have a weeks long course on software design and usability when my desire is to learn about software security. I understand its importance, but this course should be part of a UI design course, NOT in a technical CyberSecurity specialization IMO.2 - the course is all about theory, not about practical matters. Let's admit it - today's security software is not for the uninformed/experienced. Given this, again, I feel this course would be better served in another specialization about UI Design or for software design best-practices.That is my .02. I am moving onto other courses before finishing the Usability Security..... I am aware that I will have to complete this course to get my certification. This alone will discourage me from purchasing a specialization in the future.",1
103469,This course broaden your perspective of security and how are the best ways to design the security of the systems from the perspective of the users.I recommended this course to all programmers and designers no matter what level you have.,5
103470,this course is amazing,5
103471,"Exactly what I needed in a concise, interesting and provoking way.",5
103472,It was a powerful course,5
103473,Great class. Ms. Golbeck is very clear and the pacing is great. I like that you can skip ahead to the next week if you have the time.,5
103474,"Covered many topics which are complementary to skills i'm improving or I wanna improve. Also, usability is always something relegated on software engineering so it's valuable to find a course to learn more about it.",4
103475,"I find this course a good example of online course. It combines proper introductory material, good video courses, reading materials, and quiz. The quiz exercises are a bit challenging, and the final exam has very good questions, which require careful and independent thinking. As the final exam can only be taken once, it increases the challenge of passing this course, and makes the certificate more valuable.",5
103476,Great course. I recomend for everyone.,5
103477,I loved the idea of Security by Design.,5
103478,Very interesting course that will help you in designing systems that people will want to use!,5
103479,"The course was pretty good, I certainly learned a lot, but more hands on material would have been nice (Interactive).Thanks",5
103480,"This course improved my perspective of security and privacy. The concepts of usability is something I will use on every system I develop from now on. The University of Maryland team does a wonderfull work to keep the understanding easy and completed, much thanks to them.",5
103481,"Good introduction to usable security, with interesting and illustrative examples and scenarios showing how usable security concepts play out in real life and in tools and services we use on a day to day basis.",5
103482,A great course that has completely changed my perception towards software design with the course USABLE SECURITY. The materials and lecture videos are nothing but wonderful. I really had a great time while learning. Thanks,5
103483,Informative and practical use of Security design,5
103484,Great course!,5
103485,Very Good course,4
103486,I did not learn a lot.,2
103487,Great education program for usable security,5
103488,"This course is about ""good practices"" for user interface design. If this is what you are looking for it may be worth your time, just be aware that the ""production"" (quality) of the videos is among the worst courses I have taken in Coursera. On the other hand, if you are looking for a heavy Cybersecurity related course I suggest you to stay away from this one, unless you are taking the specialization in which case you don't have other choice.Content: 2.5/5Videos Quality: 1/5Practice/Theory ratio: 1/5",2

103493,Excellent course. A must for every software architect of any software that has human interaction.,5
103494,Bad sound quality,1
103495,"Honestly i only finished week 1. I was sorely disappointed that the quizzes were locked. I wasn't aware that if you audit the course you were not allowed to complete the quizzes as other courses offer this option. From what I gather from week 1 the course topics seems really good. I think it would be great if you consider letting persons who audit take the quizzes otherwise what's the use - I mean i could always go on youtube and watch videos on the same topics, the difference with coursera courses is that you get the opportunity to test the knowledge gained by doing quizzes and assignment. I hope you will consider allowing everyone to take the quiz. My issue above is the reason why I gave the course a 1 out of 5.",1
103496,"I sincerely enjoyed this course. The instructor was clear, concise, and obviously passionate about the subject matter. I appreciate that reading materials were complimentary to the videos. I can say I actually walked away with information I can apply to my career. I gained a new perspective about usability (testing and implementation) that I will be employing in my network authentication practices and policy development.",5
103497,thanks for the lectures. the best so farvery informative. never knew system designers have to go through a lot to make it usable. wow now am a system designer :),5
103498,amazing course and i would recommend it for others for sure,5
103499,If there were some Powerpoint slides in the course memorising would have been easier. Thanks a lot.,4
103500,Good Course. But has many generic stuffs. We will get to know about most of the security details that we come across our day today life,4
103501,Excellent introductory course for increasing your usability and security in soft,5
103502,Great course!Very interesting and very ingaging content (I would go so far as to say very usable).,5
103503,This is the first course that will only let you grade the quiz if you purchase the course. Highly disappointed...,1
103504,Great course! Very intriguing insights regarding security. So many of my 'myths' got busted.,5
103505,Jen covers the material well but it isn't the most technical,4
103506,It was really good on content part. I really like the course material. It is going to help me in my current organization project development work. At the same time i want to explore other available courses on cyber security.,5
103507,"I love this course, I have learn a lot!",5
103508,"I've learned a lot in this course about usability. It focuses more on the user and creating a system that works best for the user, rather than the designer. I've also learned how to create better passwords that are more secure and user-friendly. I would recommend this course to anyone.",5
103509,I think this course was worth taking an I thoroughly enjoyed through every bit of the lessons.,5
103510,this course helped me to understand designing and usability,5
103511,"A totally new insights to security. Since I am a Software Engineer student this concepts are going to prove invaluable in my future tasks. Great tutor and Coursera support, love it.",4
103512,"This course have very little to do with actual security. Most of the time you will hear about how to design applications, and what is a good design policy.",1
103513,Wonderful concepts presented beautifully. If every software developer take this course;,5
103514,"Very excellent course module for usable security, real time examples makes students understand easily.",5
103515,It is one course which should done by each and every one who is using the computer as it talks about daily security problems and this course will let every one aware about how to keep there password and at what duration User should Change there password to keep there System Secure.,4

103524,Good interesting course. Good lecturer. But course shoud covet more information because it's a little bit easy.,5
103525,"Was a better course than the other reviewers tended to complain about. Taking the examples literally might not be the best actionable route to completing a lot of the quizzes and final exam, its mostly theory on how to build sustainable and efficient systems while at the same time ensuring the security of them has the least effect on the usability of the information system or applications in mind.Some of the videos were somewhat off topic and seemed to not actually be related to what was on the quizzes at the end of the weeks topic. Some questions on quizzes weren't explained or only hinted at in the videos only to be the main topic in the next week. Other than that, a solid course.",4
103526,"This is a basic overview of security issues and user input for web sites, etc. It focuses on design, usability and other issues that affect how people interact with security log-in and other issues.It's a good foundation for looking at your or other's work and knowing the best way for the computer to interact with a user.",4
103527,"this course is cool but not hard enough i think, it should cover more materials and it should be harder.",4
103528,"Its level increases gradually, the lectures have been explained in a lucid manner and there is a lot to gain from this course",5
103529,"I think this was a very well-thought out course. In my opinion, it was well presented, contained very useful information, was accessible to someone with a limited background in cybersecurity, and used plenty of real examples to back-up its claims. An area that could use improvement is testing: some of the quizzes provided questions that seemed hard to follow, particularly the ""choose",4
103530,Interesting topics and some very good case studies. But overall I found the course a little repetitive and lacking technical depth.,4
103531,"Good introduction to the general security of UX design and experience. Remember this is just the start. Not too technical or difficult, quite easy to be honest.",5
103532,"Despite not being very fond of areas such as human-computer interaction, I found this course to be well-presented and useful. Definitely a necessity for anyone planning on building secure software.",5
103533,"Great course, with really well-explained and interesting classes. A minor problem was the audio issues, but nothing that would hinder your learning.",4
103534,Informative and the reading material for the week helped a lot,5
103535,I like how in depth this gets. it explains it very well an in ways for people who are starting off in this field to get a basic understanding in exactly what we are learning. very well put together!,5
103536,"I'm not a cyber professional, but I deal with a lot of security issues just as a part of the job. I'm also researching new hardware methods for cyber security systems. I found aspects of this course to be useful to me. Enjoyed the",4
103537,Great course with enriching materials to support.,5
103538,"This was an extremely elementary and thus disappointing course. While the importance of ""Usability"" was rightly emphasized, the representation in terms of examples, case studies, etc. was simplistic. I appreciated having my attention drawn to the pitfalls of HCI design and the consequent failure of the corresponding systems. However, the solutions were presented as if: 1.) there are always ""correct"" interface/usability choices; 2.) the ""correct"" choice is all that's needed for the system to be optimally functional; and 3.) there is never a tension between usability and effective functioning of a system (that can't be resolved with correcting the usability).It is irresponsible to suggest, for example, that a user selected memorable password is generally adequately secure without also covering ways that an interface can guide/nudge the user to create a secure password. Wide recognition of the importance of this may be more recent than the studies covered in the course. There is nothing wrong with studying old, seminal research, even in this age of ""Internet time,"" but I wish I wasn't left wondering what, if any, developments had occurred in the decade or so since that research took place.As for tension between usability and security, it absolutely exists. For instance, PGP encryption is a reliable way to secure information, yet making it usable remains a challenge. This is not even mentioned in the entire course. In fact, this course would leave an otherwise uninformed student believing that there are usability solutions waiting to be applied to every cause of info insecurity if the techies would just look. I wish the course had at least acknowledged that there are cases where a slight compromise on usability might be necessary for the sake of appropriate security.Lastly, for those designing an HCI for security, it is important to understand threat models. This concept is also missing from the course.===I reviewed this course (above) immediately after I finished it. I am now in the 3rd week of Software Security, the 2nd course in the Cybersecurity specialization, and am realizing that 2 stars was a generous assessment. Based on the prerequisites of the Software Security course, the Usable Security course, in its current form, is too elementary to be appropriate for people who have the experience/knowledge required for the rest of the courses in this specialization. As I explained above, the course relies heavily on decade-old research but does not cover any developments since. For instance, the usability issues covered in the studies are for ancient versions of browsers with no discussion of how the browsers and our infosec vulnerabilities have changed since those studies were published. Another example is the instructor's eschewing of password managers while many knowledgeable folks in the infosec community today recommend their use. The usability challenges of password managers and a discussion of how they might be mitigated would have been more appropriate.",1
103539,I really learned so much from this course,5
103540,Very interesting and a different approach to make security acceptable to users. Currnet technology allow that,4
103541,Clear and professional!,5
103542,Very informative!,5
103543,A really good course in usable security. A little more of assignments would have been better,4
103544,"Reasonable class about designing user interfaces, not much about cybersecurity.",2
103545,I just completed the course. This course is recommended to beginners like me because I learned a new perspective to cyber security. It is exciting to see the psychological aspects in cyber security. I would have given more rating if social engineering is explained too. This is just an introduction to the course and may not be appealing for people already in the field which should be expected anyway.,4
103546,The concepts are explained in best way so that even the layman can understand it and use it in his daily life and be secured,5

103555,"Thank you! I have learned a lot through the course, in a fun and easy way.",5
103556,"OK, but not really in-depth. Still has useful pointers, but they could be summarized on an A4 sheet.",3
103557,"This is a course for students with little or no work experience. I've been in the industry for twenty years and found some good information, but the quizes aren't designed for experienced adult learners. Not being able to discuss with the professor why an answer is incorrect or even knowing exactly what about an answer makes it incorrect further distances the students from learning. Given that one essentially spends an extra work day each week on the course, I expected more value for my precious time. This week I decided the value isn't there. I might recommend the course for undergrad students but not for working adults.",1
103558,"Awesome. I am genuinely exited that I actually took and finished this course. Great content, actionable and at some moments, eye opener.I totally recommend it.",5

103560,Very useful insight about Usability in Security. Advice to everyone interested in Cyber Security.,5
103561,"Doesnt meet my expectations - it is all about ""Usable"", but not about ""Security"" at all.",4
103562,"Very informative, easy to understand and gives a clear understanding about the overall concept on usable security.",4
103563,"The entirety of this course can be taught in a few sentences. If there is too great a sacrifice to productivity for the sake of security, then people will find a way around any security mechanisms in place. If something is difficult to use, then people will likely not use it.",1
103564,I missed more pratical exercises about it.,4
103565,Gives different perspective on the Cyber Security field.,4

103569,It's the best!,5
103570,Great Course,5
103571,I'm almost finished with all of the lectures and the course gives a really good introduction to the topic. What I like is that at the beginning of each video the learner is provided with a recap of the essence of this course and a short summary of the previous lecture. Its perfect for beginners and the level is not too demanding at all.,5
103572,Easy to understand and quick to study. Good general intro to UE,4
103573,"This is a easy, simple but great course for people who are interested in Ux and have no much knowledge or experience about it. This course gives me a basic overview of User Experience Design and some basic techniques. I hope Georgia Tech could provide more advanced course regarding Ux on Coursera.",5

103578,Very simple overview of the UX process.,3
103579,"It's a very basic & foundational course. But very good for someone who's never learnt or done anything in UX before. The course material is simple, breezy and satisfying. I came away having learnt few new things. And the professor kept insisting that this is only foundational program and more advanced material should be pursued elsewhere. I recommend this course to all beginners of UX.",4
103580,Course is very friendly for beginners!,5
103581,Great Introduction to User Experience Design! Will need to continue studies in this area.,5
103582,"This course is a useful if superficial introduction. The concepts presented are pretty basic, but foundational. The quizzes are very easy.The instructor covers the topic in a pleasant and clear way. I would, however, have liked examples of a more visual nature (show don't tell).Ironically, the course materials show disappointingly little concern for user experience or design. The slides look like they were thrown together in a rush and without much care for design or even spell-checking. The quiz multiple choice answers are laid out in an awful, confusing, anti-UX way. Someone should spend a few minutes fixing all of this.",3
103583,A very east to follow yet information-dense course that will give you a great grounding in UX Design!,5
103584,This is literally the introduction. It covered things i mostly knew. But its a good starting point for those who have no idea about the UX industry.,4
103585,Easy to understand. The lectures given by the instructor are very informative especially for a layman.,5
103586,Great Intro course that goes over most the general concepts of UX design. It's a good starting place to get your feet wet in this field.,4
103587,Very nice introductory knowledge.,4
103588,Easy to understand,3
103589,Lean too heavily towards theory instead of practice. I do think peer-graded assignments work better than quiz in term of UX lessons...,3
103590,Perfect course to start with UX. Concise and understandable videos reflecting topics and sufficient amount of extra materials to deepen understanding and key concepts. The combination of included videos and articles really gives an opportunity to create a holistic picture of the UX design for those who has little or no experience in the area.,5
103591,It's good to understand UX field and core definitions.,5

103608,"A very very basic but complete introduction for anyone who just wondering what UX is, or who want to structural his/her own practice in a logical and systematic manner.It also shows ideas if you want to understand deeper.Took me one day to go through the whole course. FYI.",4
103609,"Excellent presentation of the material. Concise and to the point. I wish there were more courses by this professor in depth for FREE. I know, I know, I want a lot. :) Thank you for a great introduction!!!",5
103610,This course does a wonderful job of using real world examples to better explain the theory. I came into this course somewhat familiar with UX design and now I am eager to learn more. Thanks,5
103611,"Very good instructor, easy to follow and to remember what was explained. This course fulfilled my expectations by giving a good overview on the topic and a basis for further studies. I also liked that the tests were not too easy and covered all the topics explained in the videos. This makes it easier to remember them.",5
103612,Very clear and provocative. I will keep learning on this topic.,5

103614,_ thorough introduction to ux-design . great course .,5
103615,"Useful, short, easy to go through it!",5
103616,It is very useful course,4
103617,Explaining each and every steps was good. I feel it would have been better if some visual elements in the course material which will us to understand faster than the current teaching practice.,4
103618,Very good Introductory course. Provides you with all the basic information about User experience design as well as a list of very useful resources. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to start a career in the field of UX design.,5
103619,"Great teacher, great short course for learning the lingo in the field. I recommended reading the books mentioned at the beginning of the course simultaneously with doing the course work.",5
103620,It seems to be good introduction to get to know basics of UX. I would it be a little bit more attractive and enjoyable but all in all it's good as first step to UX.,4
103621,"A great course for anyone just starting out in UXD. You will learn the terminology fairly quickly, the resources are a wonderful source, the quizzes help the course's lessons sink in. All in all, you will not be disappointed.",5
103622,It was very clear and detailed.The Instructor's examples and demonstrations made it easy to understand. Great Introduction course.,5
103623,This course was way too basic. The instructor basically just gave us links to existing web content. Very disappointed in the course. It felt like the instructor was lazy to develop a real curriculum.,1
103624,It was a good introductory course. I am giving 4 stars so that the design cycle goes around again and make the course more effortless and enjoyable.,4
103625,"Very clear and easy for me, as I'm very new to this field. By taking this course, I learned how to conduct a UX design.",5
103626,Great Introduction.,5
103627,"Although this course is admittedly an introduction to UX, it is still very underwhelming. Priced at £39, the course materials that are spread to 5 weeks could easily be done in 1 or maximum 2 weeks. It is hard to justify that for example ""week"" 5 consists of a 7mins long video and a simple quiz... ""Week"" 4 is 15mins... Overall, I felt let down by the lack of materials and assignments (no hand-on experience can be gained, no peer -graded assignments).",1
103628,Lack of examples.,3
103629,A little too common sense.,3
103630,"While the course is basic, the tests don't test user concepts (for example the order of the 4 step design process is asked 10+ times through the 5 modules)",3
103631,"It's a good introduction to UX Design, especially if you don't know anything about the field. It gives you the basics and the lingo that you will encounter in this field. It would have been nice to have some practical assignments, but overall really good start.",4
103632,Good base to start building a site,3
103633,"The videos did not seem very interactive. The teacher just read the slides. Good as an introduction, but not very hand-on course.",3
103634,"A bit short, did help with structuring the UX process but I feel it was very very basic so probably more suitable to people that just start their journey in UXland",4
103635,"This course was very real, current and useful in my life. The content was well structured & delivered exceptionally well. I liked the fact that it was both theoretically robust and practically inclined, the examples utilised where relatable and easy to follow. I also appreciated the passion is the delivery of the course by the lecturer, her enthusiasm made watching all the videos worthwhile. Thank you for this introduction- it made a significant difference in my life",5
103636,Thanks a lot!,5
103637,"This is an insightful introductory course to User Experience Design. While it is just an introduction, the lessons and the examples provided were comprehensive, leaving you with a thirst for more.",5

103640,the course was interesting and really easy to learn. I would recommend it to beginners who wish to start learning web design,5
103641,"Very repetitive content, provide only some abstract presentation of the technics used.",2
103642,"This is a great introduction for a professional who seeks to understand his co-workers in UX. The concepts are explained clearly and concisely, everything that is presented in the course is useful and to some degree builds upon previous material. Recommend to those who are interested in the topic.",5
103643,Very useful course that gave a nice insight into the broad area of UX. Very good starting point for further studies.,5
103644,Super boring & clinical presentation of the material.,2
103645,Thanks!,4

103649,An Informative Introductory course.,4
103650,"Fast and practical. When I wanted to learn the basics of UX, this course gave me all the important elements I need to understand. Plus, I was able to start sketching right away and implement my ideas at work.",4
103651,"I would LOVE to give this course 5 stars because I absolutely loved it. However, one small thing that drove me nuts makes me give it 4 star rating. I am a big type A personality and I wanted a perfect 100% grade. For this reason I take very, very detailed notes and studied very hard. When I was taking the tests, all of the answers came to me and I knew they were right without question. Then I would get marked wrong some answers at the end. For example, there were several questions relating to the 4 phases of the design cycle. These should very easy answers as the question was usually ""What follows after the 'alternative design phase"" which is an easy answer, ""prototyping"". Regardless it would be marked wrong, and it was absolutely impossible to get 100% and I encountered this issue on about 3 questions. I would encourage you to make sure your answers are properly programmed into the response bank",4

103680,It is a fantastic course. I loved it. It fits my interests.,4
103681,Great for novices.,4
103682,Interesting and fun to learn,4
103683,Expected more technical details of this course. Seems like it is more for managers to understand what the techies are talking about.,3
103684,"I found this course interesting and engaging. i originally worried about whether I would be able to understand the instructor's accent. But, there was no problem understanding the instructor's English. The material is a good introduction and I learned quite a bit.",5
103685,Well information,4
103686,"Course is gathering general information on smartphones, and tells an historical view of smartphones et OS associated.what could help professionnally is more about how to develop apps on these phones, today and tomorrow.",2
103687,I found this course enjoyable and easy to follow along with.,4
103688,Too much version specific details.Instructor was reading slides vs explaining the technologies ( telling a story )The Quiz part cant be more lame,1
103689,awesome course!!!,5
103690,Very good and to the point content. Very informative,5
103691,This is probably one of the worst courses I've taken in Coursera.Just an enumeration of what's on each version of the operative systems and few more information.,1
103692,A good glance on the technologies in this current trend. Good to keep ourselves updated and learned.,5
103693,"Had fun with this course. Precise, concise & the content is cutting edge & juicy!",5
103694,Awesome Course on cellphone technologies. It's a vital course in my telecommunication/communication career.,5
103695,"Good lecture and educational.Extremely bad thing that is not offered and for free.same bad is that they are not try to explain more, (for students with less tech skills).In any case i am happy with the course and i will continue with the specialization, but regardless my decision to continue, my very fair rate will stay low, (especially for the fact that they didn't offer the course and for free).",3
103696,"I feel that I wasted my time and money on this course to be very honest. Should have requested a refund when I could. The professor really doesn't put in the effort like other professors on Coursera. He is literally reading out the content on each slide. The content isn't very enlightening either, it's just facts about mobile technology and their release dates. One can read that up on wikipedia I honestly think this course should be taken off this platform so no one else falls for it as I did. If you're reading this before you enroll, don't do it, don't waste your time and money on this.",1
103697,"Good intro, but the quizzes could be more challenging.",4
103698,Great course. But introductory level. Would appreciate if in future in dept course or specialization becomes available for each module of this specialization.,5
103699,"Good stuff, i would also compare Windows Phone to them as well. :) Nice work.",5
103700,Thank you !!,5
103701,"the lecture gave industrial terms and key words which is good but it is mainly reading from the slides, no elaboration or illustration.",3
103702,repeating slides,4
103703,A very basic course for smartphone technology. For a laymen its good choice to cover all basics but not for a technical person.,4
103704,Well presented seemed a little weak on latest Android versions. But some info on tablets was a nice bonus. Definitely recommend to anyone trying to understand smartphones and the differences between Apple and Android versions.,4
103705,Very good about smart phone,4
103706,"There's a lot of detailed information here, but it's surface level at best. I don't feel I have a better understanding of how smartphones work.Although I am now more familiar with the tech components of a few smartphone models and the timeline of iOS/Android OS development, I am not able to connect this information outside of base facts. I'm not even sure how the smartphone components fit together, or what they actually do.It would be a really interesting course if there were more examples, such as how smartphone components work together or a deeper comparison between the iOS and Android systems is used when discussing the development timeline of each model, instead of pure cognitive knowledge being read from a slide.Maybe these concepts are explored further in the other courses for this certificate, but as a stand alone introduction to smartphone technologies the information is poorly imparted.",2
103707,Good if you want to know in detail about the smartphones development history and lots of basic things,4
103708,This course is informative and helpful to get the basic insight in smartphone technologies.,4
103709,"This course has nothing to do with ""emerging technologies."" The course is essentially a quick history of Android and iOS smartphones that could be learned by browsing Wikipedia.",1
103710,great informative course!,5
103711,"Very good level, excellent teacher!!!",5
103712,a very nice and informative course,5
103713,"While informative I question the value of memorizing release years of os updates. Then again, it was an easy entry into the broader specialization. I think it is always a good thing to ease students in with a less challenging intro course much like a video game begins with an easy level and slowly gets harder.",3
103714,"everything was completely well explain, I gratefully thanks all this.",5
103715,A brief introduction to all the need to know's about smartphones from day 1 providing enough detail for any audience. Would definetely suggest taking notes or watching again for people new to the concept. For me a good review of every smartphone technology. Thank you,4
103716,Sorry but this is awful. Literally just reading from some very high level slides no dept to the course. I cannot recommend this course in its current state.,1
103717,just reading the materials,1
103718,I though the class focused too much on enumerating various names of technologies rather than describing them in depth.,1
103719,"Very good content and presentation,Thank you",5
103720,Informative summary of smartphone development and pertinent technologies,3
103721,Helpful in understanding the history of smartphones.,5
103722,"Honestly, this course was a waste of time. The professor seems to have gathered some information about the version history of iOS and android platforms, thrown it onto some slides, and then reads from those slides. There is no discussion of the context of those technologies.",1
103723,although the teacher must be using android phone but it does not influence its a nice lecture,4
103724,"Information in this course is thorough and comprehensive. The material is entirely composed of the specifications, release and feature development, and comparison of Android OS and iOS. The instructor shows slides and reads the slides in their entirety. There is no additional information the instructor provides that is not already included in the slide content. The teaching is not very stimulating. But the instructor does cover the material completely.",4
103725,"Generic history information, nothing to teach really. completed the tests about ios and android without even watching the videos.",1
103726,It's a good explanation about the technologies used on smartphones but it mote a comparison of what we had and what we have now. It's nothing really new and fundamental for this specialization.,3
103727,"Excellent course, precise and well detailed information, It would be nice to include some Windows Phone information which is increasingly used in last years. I recommend this course to every IT professional.",5
103728,"This is an excellent course to get some basic knowledge about the iOS and Android history, when and how this systems developed their unique features, or how that influenced products in whole. Yet, quizzes are a bit boring. They require you to actually know history of evolving features tied to exact dates/versions.",4
103729,"This is certainly not an-depth look at smartphone technology. The lecturer just reads aloud the text on screen, without fleshing out the concepts therein or providing any explanation. Anybody can tell me what an acronym stands for - I want to know what these features actually do, how they work, how they're developed.I have no desire to upgrade to the whole package for this course. It's a time waster.",1
103730,Good course,4
103731,Not So help full about Smartphone. Now aday everyone knows What is there in Smartphone.,1
103732,Cool !,5
103733,"Good structure but a basic course.It´s a good compilation of information about iOS and Android.I think that some generic informations should be also consider on this course no matter if it´s iOS or android.Some videos explaining the features like (gps, siri, multi-core processor...) would be good.",3
103734,Will knowing the stages of emerging technologies help in the real world applications? There is no conclusion if knowing accomplishing anything.,3
103735,"Clear, informative, well structured.",5
103736,excellent compilation of related tech specs presented in an easy to understand format.,5
103737,GOOD COURSE TO START WITH. VERY OK.,5
103738,Very informative. Would highly recommend,5
103739,good introduction to smartphone,3
103740,I didn't learn anything useful!I just didn't like this course at all.,2
103741,"Well presented and clear,. however, the course is more a history of smartphone operating systems than emerging trends of the technology.",3
103742,"Absolutely U-S-E-L-E-S-S, at least in the free version.",1
103743,It was a great course. The integration of quizes during videos is a great Idea. It keeps you interested. Great teacher as well.,5
103744,This is only theory related to the evolution of the systems. How their features change over the time.I personally think that it is useless because you really do not learn anything.,1
103745,really really good and best ever with this prof.,5
103746,"I really wonder why this should be a course at an University. It's just some sort of fact-dump of Android and iOS, which ist current, but will be outdated within four weeks (seriously).So, to keep up with this issue, it's just better to read some blogs about this or type ""ios vs android"" in Google.",1
103747,I'm not sure who this course was aimed at since there was a heavy use of technical vocabulary to describe many things someone with that level of vocabulary should know. I already knew most of the course material but I learned some new things as well. It would have been one star less but it being a short course which only took me a few hours to complete made me enjoy the experience more,4
103748,Good course for summarize,5
103749,Clear and concise,5
103750,It was ok. I knew pretty everything. Good for beginners.,5
103751,"Thank you a very good overview of all the features and history of smartphones - iOS and Android.Some explanation of some of these features would have been usefulAlso, please consider Microsoft as well",4
103752,"I actually understood everything about smartphones and the history. As a developer, it made my life a lot more easier than normal.",5
103753,Highly informative and useful about mobile technology and looking forward for more courses like this one.,5
103754,I liked this course,5
103755,Nice overview with detail on smartphones. The course cover a lot of detail and history of the OS's but can get a little monotonous over the different stages of the OS. Sometimes felt like just reading features. Overall I liked the course and thought it provide a very nice overview.,4
103756,It's a fantastic choice of subject. learning from the experts guides you to even a better level of understanding.,5
103757,"Excellent course, with many top notch examples, maybe even better than the 1st part !",5
103758,Great course and great teacher. This course will help you if you are developing your business and make better decisions. Thank you Ed.,5
103759,Great!,5
103760,THANK YOU!,5
103761,Great course! A lot of new and useful information. Thanks to the team!,5
103762,"Glad to have done this course, after the Part 1. Professor Hess's insights definitely have brought me to a different level of thinking, planning and running a business. Hope to read his books and make another of his courses anytime.",5
103763,Great lessons from a great teacher with good cases.,5
103764,this teacher is amazing love the way he teaches..,5
103765,Know when and how to grow a business successfully with this course.,5
103766,The instructor is very annoying and he talks way too much about non important stuff.,1
103767,cool,5
103768,"Not as powerful as Part I, but definitely a must for business people and entrepreneurs. Very interesting subject and great professor. Take growth to the next level...",4
103769,"Highly practical, loved it.",5
103770,"Captivating course, highly motivated instructor, deep thinking and understanding course and materials.",5
103771,"Excellent course, It gave me a lot of useful information that help me in the procces of grow my business, very recommended.",5
103772,Professor Ed is very inspiring and engaging. He has the best teaching skills!,5
103773,"Edward Hess is a great tutor, enthusiastic and very knowledgeable. Time flies with Ed! It's always engaging watching and learning from him. I can't wait to apply the principles, skills and techniques to my own company and follow suit - Grow to Greatness. Thanks for a great course!",5
103774,"Insightful course that will remind the student of the critical importance of people in the business, as well as critical best practices. Great course!",5
103775,Great teacher!Thank you,5
103776,Excellent teacher and course. Congratulations!!!,5
103777,"Amazing information, great companies who really explin what made them great. Exellent research that really drives home the what and the how to grow a business as well as just think metaphorically to apply it to other stages of business or life. would defniitly recomend this to friends and other entreprenuers.",5
103778,Very interesting thank you.,4
103779,C,5
103780,"Hess is an excellent mind and teacher/leader/expert/veteran/entrepreneur in the field! Can't wait to connect and learn more from him, he seems to understand business like a seasoned man should.",5
103781,"The two Grow to Greatness courses are fantastic and I would highly recommend them to anyone starting or running an existing business. The material is a great mix of theory and practical information and Professor Hess and his staff expertly bring the course content to life. His passion for the subject matter and his enjoyment of teaching clearly shines through, even on these taped lectures. Thank you!",5
103782,"Ed, is the best teacher in my life. Very usefull course. Thanks to coursera.",5
103783,Professor Hess is amazing!,5
103784,Pretty cool!,5
103785,"Even better than part 1! But a small caveat, this is not for new grads or people just starting a business - choose some of the University of Maryland entrepreneur classes instead for that. That said, a must for people with 3+ years in business.",5
103786,Great instructions on building a team. Delivered beautifully by very experienced professor.,5
103787,Excellent course. Really interesting concepts.,5
103788,It would be better if the course was updated to swift 3+ (I know it's new but still),5
103789,"it's nicely designed, but it would be great if the course designers have their input in evaluating our projects and most importantly updating the material to the latest swift version as this is the whole purpose of why one would register in this course.",4
103790,"amazing course to start programming with Swift, easy to understand, and easy to learn.",5
103791,Great Course for learning Swift,4
103792,Great intro,4
103793,Basic but interesting for novices.,3
103794,Good course. It is better to add more video(lectures). Thanks to the instructor.,5
103795,"A good course for wetting your feet in the world of app development. I'll this course was enjoyable and I learned many practical skills. With that said though, for someone completely new to programming I could see this being tough, and there were a few times instructions were slightly vague. Also with it being an outdated version of swift, switching to the latest version isn't seamless. All in all, I enjoyed the course for what it offered, and would suggest it to any programmer looking to pick up this new language.",4
103796,Love the course...,5
103797,Good course to learn the Swift basics.,4
103798,"It definitively could be a whole lot better, look and learn from Udacity's nanodegree.",3
103799,"The video materials were very poor, they did not cover all the aspects and the explanations were very brief. The course only contained a single project, which although fun, is not enough for learning a new language. After completing this course I feel that I don't really know Swift, but I can use it. After each week you have to complete a quiz. They should replace these quizzes with project, where you write real code. I took this course for free, but I wouldn't pay for it.",2
103800,Nice to start programming with swift.,4
103801,The contents are not updated to swift 3 and Xcode 8,3
103802,"It is a very small introduction to swift, while the last assignment expects you to be rather fluent in programming using swift. A lot of self study using the guides provided by apple and other sources is needed to successfully complete this course.Furthermore the video's indicate a lack of preparedness on part of the instructors as a lot of sentences are cut of halfway , then started a new with a new goal. All of which makes this course very hard to understand. For free it is passable, but had I payed I would sincerely regret itPart 2 is better, but still changing thoughts midway in a sentence",1
103803,This course is a great introduction to the Swift language!!,5
103804,"Good pace, comprehensive introduction to language. Makes it easy to get started learning Swift.",4
103805,"I learned to develop apps and how to make class, struct and function in the playground, right now I could see the difference between variables (int,float, char, etc) and much more skills. I consider that i could make a great app for apple in the future",5
103806,Solid course with beginner information about swift programming language and some small projects in swift.,4
103807,"It's really nice and fun,",5
103808,"As an Objective C developer, I found this course very useful.",5
103809,"10 out of 10 course , really great",5
103810,The course should have more programming assignments than just having simple quizzes. And please update the language for SWIFT 3.,3
103811,"The pair review it's really not the way to go. If you don't have the horse power to check it yourself, create automated tests to pass like other courses.",2
103812,"A little bit too light and not really challenging. Just a quick view of the language. The teaching team does not seems really organized : just a quick view of the language, no slide, just someone who is presenting code on screen, no real support on the forum from the teaching team.",2
103813,"Overall the course provides a good introduction to the swift language. However, this course is not suitable for completely new learners.",3
103814,"Other than the fact that things are thought on an older version of swift, I don't find anything wrong about this course. It's been a great learning experience.",5
103815,very basic,3
103816,"By far to introductory, I think that this course should be an extension of the iOS App Development Basics",2
103817,"As a professional Instructional Designer, I can attest that this is the poorest-designed course I have ever seen. Regrettably, I paid for the entire specialization up-front, and I cannot get a refund or even a Coursera credit for enrolling in a different specialization.Be aware that the faculty who is the instructor of record does not participate in the course. The video lectures are poorly done, including errors and misstatements that could have been edited out, but it appears that no one bothered to edit the raw footage before uploading it.There is not so much instruction as an overview. There are no coding exercises until the final assignment, which is poorly-described and requires the student to self-teach using outside sources.There are app specializations in Coursera that appear much better-designed. Look elsewhere.",1
103818,Jack is the best ...,5
103819,Best way to learn Swift programming. Definitely recommended.,5
103820,"Course content: some Swift specific topics are shortly covered in the videos. Overall, the teaching material is very short. In the first week, students basically learn how to start Xcode. Week four contains a 15 minutes video on image processing, that's basically it for the week.Follow-up readings for week two just provide a link to Apple's iOS Developer site. That's clearly not enough for a course. Students can google for tutorials by themselves.Project: The projects mentions classes, which are not covered in the course. It was then also my impression from the peer reviews, that some students without prior knowledge were just lost.There are many great tutorials on the web which offer more insights and give students a much more fundamental knowledge than this course.",1
103821,The lectures are fairly light and there are no assignments throughout the course to reinforce the material. Mostly they just introduce a few concepts then point you at the Apple Swift documentation. They really don't go into much detail.The final assignment is good for getting your feet wet but is poorly specified.,2
103822,"I am enjoying the class. I'm taking it simultaneously with some of the others in the specialization, which is I think the right decision. It's a great quick intro, but it's definitely not ideal for newbies to programming.",4
103823,awesome course,5
103824,"An ok introduction to Swift Programming, but I can see people who do not have previous development experience struggling with this course. Also lecturers were virtually nonexistent on the forums to help with questions which is disappointing since it is a paid course which implies you are paying for their time and effort not just the certificate.Best advice for people taking this course is to get through the material as early as possible and give yourself as much time as possible to work on the project, don't wait till the last week to work on it.Would also suggest the following changes to improve the course and help people understand the material better:1. Have a programming exercise to complete at the end of every week to prove you have understood the material taught, a quiz alone with 10 or less questions is not enough. The course ramps up way to quickly with the project if all you have been doing is following the videos, students should be practicing and proving they know the work far more often.2. Provide a clearer project brief since it was clear many people did not understand all the requirements.3. Provide a video of what the final project should do in general to make it even clearer.Overall I didn't have a bad experience with the course, just disappointed that it was really bear bones, there were too few opportunities to prove your understanding, it was poorly managed and the lack of interaction from the lecturers a massive problem when they are being paid to help out, not just provide videos and forget about the students.",3
103825,This course has good interactivity),4
103826,it would be great if I can have a free certificate.,5
103827,"It's very interesting and useful to learn for Swift programming. And through this course, I realized what objective oriented programming is.",4
103828,Amazing course with awesome material.A great way to start learning the basics of Swift and getting to know people that have the same aspiration of learning new stuff.,5
103829,Very well taught. The instructors now what they are talking about.,5
103830,Pretty good basic course. Not that good as classic Scala Functional Programming (being simply awesome) but still good.,4
103831,Great introduction to swift programming,5
103832,Great Course,5
103833,Very clear,5
103834,It's very easy. On the other hand the teachers do not do very deep and you need to do a lot of selfstudy. Would not recommend for the ones without basic knowledge of CS.,5
103835,"The course was not prepared at all, badly improvised and with no structure. I wish I could have my money back.",1
103836,"Videos are poorly done and leave a lot of useful details out. There is zero support from staff in the forums. If you take this course, plan on spending a lot of time doing research on external sources in order to gain an understanding of the very broad and lacking in detail videos.To improve this course, the instructors should:-provide links to at least one textbook on Swift-add Mentors to the course to help students in the forums-include a repository of code snippets for practice of the concepts",2
103837,Good course. Somewhat odd levels of difficulty. Like the weekly lessons are easy and then the wall goes up in the task at week 5.,3
103838,"Nice course, with rather fast pace!",4
103839,Covers the basics,3
103840,I taked this course as part of the entire especialization; this course alone does not allow you to create programs but helps you to understand how swift works and the logic behind; also there is a nice optional chapter to compare against objective-c.There are few instructions that need to be updated to a newer version of swift but are minimal and you can live with that.Starting the final assignment to the final week is a mistake: I would recommend to go as fast as possible in te previous tasks and then take time to do the assignment.,5
103841,"Great course, I'd like it..I study basic SwiftThanks a lot for this course...",5
103842,ProsConciseModular based learningConsCourse needs more auto graded assignments.Lack of feedback in discussion forums.Assignment language is not very clear.Overall I prefer this course to the android specialization but not for the reasons you may think. The android development platform is more or a less a mess compared to ios. Android studio feels more like a toy than a complete product. Emulation is slow and almost un-usuable with plenty of boilerplate code required to do simple events. Xcode by comparison is very smooth and easy to use. Swift syntax is also very clean compared to Java syntax. But is not without its grievances.At the end of the day you will choose the platform you work best in.,2
103843,"this was thefirst course i payed for and unfortunately the worst expierience.lack of content beyond the stuff in the available simple swift tutorials andfrom an eduucational pint of view afwully if at all preparedits as shame that i cannot give this ""course"" ZERO stars which it deserves!i should have checked the very negative feedback of the former participants before bying iti will be much MUCH more alert regarding content on coursera from now on",1
103844,"The teaching content is not at the same level of what required to complete the final project, which frustrated the beginners and also stop me from finishing the whole course. What a pity!",3
103845,Very disappointed. Having coding assignments weekly would have been very helpful. The quizzes often asked for information that was never presented in the lessons. The instructors were never present in the forums to answer questions. The final project asked us to do things that hadn't even been mentioned in the course materials. I would not recommend this course to anyone. The only reason it got 2 stars instead of 1 was because I did learn some Swift.,2
103846,very cool !!!,5
103847,Very caotic.,2
103848,"The videos are poorly done, and it's hard to follow with practicing in a Playground at the same time. Also, some of the optional material, is required for completing the assessment, which a bit unfair. The material covered in the videos is too basic to be able to apply the principles to a larger programme.",3
103849,Great Course! Lots of fun!,5
103850,"Worst course I took on Coursera so far! It was my first course I actually paid for and it turned out to be the least useful one. The small number of exercises and videos does not justify the high price of the course. It might have been ok if they had included the iOS parts also, but charging 70 EUR for the first part alone is grossly overpriced.",1
103851,"Although Parham Aarabi is listed as the professor throughout this specialization, it's a bit of a bait-and-switch. Prof Aarabi is an award-winning professor at U of Toronto, but it turns out he knows little about iOS and has Jack Wu teach most of the material. Jack Wu is probably a heck of a developer but he's a terrible instructor.I previously took the Android Specialization, which was excellent, so I was shocked at how bad this course was.",1
103852,"The course is overall very useful and I learned a lot, although a component of self-learning is essential to succeed. I think it would be ideal if the peer assignment would allow more shades in the grading, other than ""Yes"" or ""No"".",4
103853,"Having completed the assignment after many hours of trial & error; here are some suggestions for improving the class for future sessions.Increase the length and depth of the lectures so that more of the materials needed for the assignment are covered.For each week, have an optional programming exercise (not graded) but with a model answer (with explanations of why) so that students have a concrete example on which to practice key concepts on.As classes & structs are very important to completing the assignment (instead of just including the SWIFT manual chapter on classes & structs in the Follow Up Reading), include an actual lecture about this topic.Improve the description of the assignment to be completed. Be specific about what is required (e.g.; what does interface mean? Is is a User interface or is just a specified variable which can be changed in the program code? What do you mean by order of applying filters? Do you mean a variable which lets you decide order of filters and executes the filters accordingly or does the ability to manually rearranging the order of the calling of functions in the code suffice?)Improve the alignment between the assignment and the review criteria. The assignment asks for FIVE filters but there is no matching criterion in the review criteria. Based on the current review criteria, creating two filters would suffice to demonstrate ability to order and get full points for varying intensity for more than 1 filter.I hope the remainder of the modules are better otherwise I will be extremely disappointed !",2
103854,Enjoyed the lectures. I wish there would be more materials to practice with.,3
103855,Absolutely poor. Avoid. No professor monitoring of the fo,1
103856,Required things about the swift programming language needed for iOS development is present in this course,4
103857,"awesome , but you should make more practice problems .",5
103858,"The course is good, but in my opinion, it's too basic for people who are already developers (in platforms other than iOS). Hopefully the next course in the serie will be a little bit deeper.",4
103859,Great course for starters.,5
103860,"There are only a few hours of content across the five weeks. The whole course can be done in a single evening. However, if you try this starting from no programming experience it will likely be extremely hard to complete. Since the course has as a prerequisite that you can already code this shouldn't be an issue for anyone.",3
103861,This is very well course that tell you how can you programming in Swift. It's interesting.,4
103862,"I think its good that its given reference material for further readings, but this shouldn't exonerate you from explaining the details of the language, if I wanted to learn swift from apple's documentation I would be there right now, not here, if I'm watching your course its because I expect to learn it here.",3
103863,Bad content and instructor. no logistic in place. if you are planning to pay to get certificate. I would suggest look else where. my $279 are stuck in here and they don't reply to forum posts.,1
103864,it is great,5
103865,Fundamentals explained very well,5
103866,It was simple good starter lesson..,5
103867,It is very god so far I am on the second week and I am very happy and pleased with the content also lecturers are very educated and calm. STRONGLY RECOMMENDED,5
103868,Very bad course.,1
103869,"Certainly not a beginners course. You needed to have a good programming knowledge to make any sense of this course. The final assignment asked you to do things you hadn't been taught. As I hadn't done any programming for 20 years, I certainly found this difficult. Fell behind and there isn't really anyone there to help. Almost asked for a refund but decided to try to continue. I'm struggling to motivate myself into the second course. I really hope it's better than the first one.",1
103870,This is very good course for iOS beginners,5
103871,"The weekly lectures/assignments did little to prepare for the final assignment. They were short and high level without any coding to back them up.It is possible to blaze through the first four weeks in a couple hours.....and then spend weeks on the final assignment because you will need to learn most of it on your own by looking through api documentation.To the instructors: If you want to see what a good ""intro to language"" course looks like, checkout:https://www.coursera.org/course/programming1",1
103872,"It's not a university standard course. It's more like introduction to introduction DIY Swift. The videos are chaotic and lack explications, examples, exercises and practical assignments. Much better intro to Swift can be found on many youtube channels or just on swift documentation website.",1
103873,"Thank you for the course.With all my respect to authors, I have something to say:I beleave all 4 cources in the spesialization could be combine to one. Looks like authors may invest more time and passion to it. I just skipped all videos with Parham Aarabi.",3
103874,"Since it is an introduction to Swift programming I believe it should contain more information about particular topics, not in depth but essence of course. You have provided a official Swift Apple documentation, so I'm wondering why this short course if It's necessary (read not necessary to know everything for beginning) to know everything about Swift language.",4
103875,"Pleased with the course. Well described all the videos and very understandable examples as well. Although no example codes were given so that's why I give a 4 stars. But I highly recommend it. I had a background in Objective-C and I was wondering how to start with Swift, and I think it was a good way to start. Thank you.",4
103876,"The initial lessons were rather chaotic. The idea was good, but the execution was not really good.The significantly improved the quality for the second course so I assume that for a new iteration, the it will be better too.",1
103877,"At first the presentations are really on a semi professional level (copy & paste codes, making errors without knowing the cause). They show a lot what can be done with swift but the never show/mention what it's really usefull for (no ""real life"" usage just snippets after snippets).To few practical doings (mostly only quiz stuff)",1
103878,"This is great for people with prior programming experience in Java, C++, and javascript.",5
103879,"I liked it, everything is well described, clear and helpful.The last assignment description is not clear. The Peer Review reviewing criteria is not clear as well. It could be understood by many ways. They should enhance the peer review instructions.",4
103880,"This course is a waste of time and money. I'm an experienced programmer, and I thought this would be a good introduction to Swift; it wasn't. The first two weeks were short, introductory programming lessons. Week 3, ""Advanced Swift,"" consisted of one 12-minute video that barely scratches the surface of three separate topics.Many things that I would consider fundamentals for this type of programming course (classes, for example) were rarely even mentioned, much less taught and demonstrated.If you want to learn Swift, look elsewhere. Don't waste your time and money on this course.",1
103881,"I think for somebody who has no prior knowledge in this course will find it difficult to understand. I have taken some introductory courses in swift programming and were much more elaborating than this; for instance, the part ""i think"" in week 4 were Jack Wu explains closures, functions, enums, structs... in less than 10min, i studied that in around 5 hours atleast in other visual tutorials online. in the last lecture on image processing, the instructor gave 16minutes tutorial on manipulating image pixels and then gave a link to a website to explain everything about ImageProcessing, a much heavier topic than working with pixels, and even it was not in Swift but Objective-C which i have no knowledge in that language and it wasnt stated in the course that it was a prerequisite.final assignment is quite vague on the requirements needed by the instructor. would have prefered to have more interaction with the instructors on the assignment atleast. Im not the only one complaining about this issue, you can check the discussion in the course. I guess im fortunate that i have already studied those courses from external sources before i started here.one of the instructors speaks quite fast with alot of anxiety making it quite difficult to understand without repeating the video.",1
103882,The conversations some time confused! but in general the course is great!,5
103883,Great course!,5
103884,"Although I've programming experience, this course's assignment is not easy to complete.I recommend to study Object-oriented language such as Java or C++ before taking this course.",4
103885,It is a very good introduction to Swift.,5
103886,"In my honest opinion, the quality of this course is not that high. You can expect to learn some basic syntax of Swift, and that's about it. There are very little material each week, and then you get a quiz, which is not the best form of examination nor for learning. I do not recommend this course.",2
103887,"Far less staid than some of the more traditional academic teaching formats in this science field. I was surprised I actually anaged to get through the introductory module but by the end of the course I was less inclined to want to attempt the end of module project simply because the instructions did not really provided sufficient indicators that guided newcomers to the subject of programming but in this science field it seems that is the norm with many introductory programming courses.Maybe the people teaching have forgotten what its like to start at the beginning and recall a time when they thought surely there is a better way in which to teach this subject that makes the connection between theory and practice and the relative interconnection much like bitesize stepping stones links a more plausible and achievable option for those unfamiliar in the field of computer science. Not sure why this aspect seems to fall short in CS but for some reason it does.I should imagine this course for many people who are either familiar with the fundamentals of programming and/or aufait with CS concepts on the whole and have already acquired the necessary basic skill set / knowledge base of programming, will find the subject and teachings rather informative and a move forward in the development of programming languages as the format in writing programs does depict a much simpler approach when compared to other languages.Sadly, for a complete beginner to CS this, in my opinion, fails to sufficiently guide or assist newcomers in building the confidence to later embark on a project that draws on the subject topics taught thus far and to that end its a bit of a shame as it tends to dampen your enthusiasm if you are interested in the field of computer science as that lack of clarification on what aspects relate to what factors does not become clear so when faced with the daunting task of the end of module project you may find yourself non-plussed wondering which topic relates to which task in the final project?I am sure other people will be inclined to disagree with my opinion on this but this is, after all, just my opinion, after giving the subject taster a try, the end result for me, was that the teaching methods were good as they appeared more relaxed and format was offered in a far more enjoyable way of teaching/learning a subject that, I felt, attempted to invoke or entice people where an interest in CS had been sparked and was perhaps aiming to offer a route in which to build the foundations of a programming language but then by the final week it was a case of well we have thrown this information your way, its now up to you to decipher what you need to apply to the which part of the final project and is done so under the guise of problem solving.The latter being a plausible concept I would find perhaps more applicable later on in the specialisation as you develop knowledge/skills. But to be incorporated into the very first module of this pathway it seems doing so is, what it seems like most introductory programming courses invoke, and, is quite a leap to embark upon especially without first being offered stepping stones sufficient enough to feel certain you have adequate understanding to be able to sift through the information provided and subsequently decide upon which aspects are relevant in order to attempt to accomplish the tasks set that ultimately form to complete the final project.Its actually through being guided by the experts whose teachings highlight to newcomers through practical visual sessions where we actually begin to learn where these interconnections link between these chunks of informational topics - all of which form the essential fundamental building blocks - and in so doing, that perhaps perceived initial 'spoon fed' approach then enables a newcomer to build sufficient skills and knowledge to then be able to actually 'develop' their confidence. Without the essential basic foundational mixture how is it possible to engage newcomers enough for them to determine when they will then feel equipped to attempt a final project? This stepping stone approach is surely the most effective way to equip a person new to a subject field so they can then broaden their knowledge base. Alas, in CS it seems the falling flat on your face so to speak is a preferential approach to learning in this field of study.Its such a shame these highly intellectual people who create these courses forget what its like to start at the very beginning and the time it takes and guidance needed in order for a person to be able to feel like they are ready to dive in and give a topic like this a whirl. Like I said, its only my opinion but this is where the interconnection and building of the knowledge base falls short at an early stage of development.",3
103888,Nice introduction to Swift essentials. The optional topics are quite interesting.,5
103889,"It might be a great choice if you are already familiar with Swift programming! There is a huge gap between the week 1-4 and week 5, in other words during the first 4 weeks, you will learn about just the syntax and idea of swift programming but all of a sudden you have to write a program with over 50 lines of code.I would recommend to offer more details and more practices during the first few weeks from this course before writing a complicated program.",2
103890,The content is absolutely amazing. What I didn't really like was that the last assignment was a curve ball to me and most of the other students in my class. There was very little preparation to it and thus took a while to understand how to get started on it.,4
103891,Loved it. allow time for the Final assignment. it can take awhile to do correctly,5
103892,Too easy.,4
103893,Nice easy introduction. If you've already got a programming background.,4
103894,"Should be lecture by Professor instead of BS student.The content was not well organized.Also should prepare slides and explain the Swift for more details.More exercises needed in each weeks lecture.Hopefully, this course should improve next time.",2
103895,"This is a well designed course that is clear in what it focuses on to give you a good foundation. That said, there is so much more to learn.Make sure you look at the final project after each module to get an idea for all the opportunities to apply the optional materials. You can still pass without doing using the concepts in the optional sections but there is time to get even more out of the final project if you prepare and explore.",4
103896,Need allot of improvement,3
103897,Course is good but the early weeks need to be more challenging. 70% of the work was in the last week.,4
103898,"Very good course, give me a basic understanding of SWIFT language.",5
103899,Please stay away from this course.,1
103900,"Not so impressed with this course so far, let's see the rest of the specialisation.",2
103901,I loved the course setup!,5
103902,"This is a great starter course, the Reading Materials are a great way to learn directly from the source with a clearer understanding thanks to the videos. Thank you!",4
103903,"Good introduction, it would be even better with a few more presentation on SWIFT.",3
103904,"This course, specifically the last week, really helps in gaining understanding of how the digital images are being processed on the back of a applications. Nice job tutors!",5
103905,I donot own a Mac nor a iMac and hence I wish to opt out.Apologies.,2
103906,"Great course first of all.One problem about the course is probably going to be the lectures. The lectures are explaining fundamental basics in Swift,which are really useful, but they are not comprehensive enough. So for most of the students, I believe, will have to do a lot of self-studying to finish the final project.But still, the final project is challenging and interesting. Swift is not a hard language to learn, so after went through all the lectures and read some books on Swift programming, I was able to finish the project.",4
103907,"Thank you for this course. It was interesting and helpful. Before.But I failed. I got bad mark and I don't know why.I have only one good comment. But I have 3 bad marks and only 2 good. I am a looser, i guess.So I hate this course, this website, this review system and this world.Thank you again.",1
103908,"This course is good to start with Swift programming in IOS. this had help me a lot, while not having much time to devote. I appreciate this.",4
103909,I'd like to have practice tasks during the course not only the final one,3
103910,Not much interaction between the instructors and students. Course videos were very helpful.,4
103911,Good Course! This class is for people who know how to program (intermediate to advance software programmers),4
103912,I didn't like very much the two teacher,3
103913,Its simply awesome.,5
103914,"great so far, I love the approach of teaching swift before going into building apps , definitely recommend",5
103915,"The course seemed to be very easy, I'd say even disappointingly easy, but then, when I started the final assignment, I realized that I was wrong. And it was so much fun developing filters.",5
103916,"Huge gap between videos and final assignment.Videos should be edited, we are not interested in trials and errors of the instructors.",1
103917,it really did help me to get started,5
103918,Very good course of Swift.,5
103919,it becomes much easier to learn swift with this course,5
103920,"The Good:The idea of having the lectures in a Q&A style, two experts in continuous conversation about the topic has a potentialThe Bad:That potential is wasted on poorly planned lessons and course contentThe Ugly:Instructors run the Swift code that is written during the lesson and they get a wrong result due to an error in the code. They both agree that the result is weird but then continue to explain that this is how Swift works. In short, they are misleading and confusing you on a topic you are trying to learn.This is of course unintentional but gives you a clue about how the quality check on lecture videos are taken care of. Details here: https://www.coursera.org/learn/swift-programming/discussions/DBk-SJO2EeWNbBIwwhtGwQ",2
103921,Learned more about image processing than Swift.,1
103922,The course should have been more thorough and should have been accompanies with good programming exercises as well..At some starting course there was also some cross talk among the instructors. The module on image processing should be reviewed as after some point it becomes sort of boring.,2
103923,"This course needs major improvement. Lectures included errors in the code. While showing code in video lectures instructor was quick to delete code, not giving time for students to view and understand what had just been shown.On Dec 15, two weeks before due date of final project, large portions of all weeks of the course were changed, requiring going back through to complete these new lectures. No adjustment was made to the due date.Requirements for the final project are vague and confusing and I am not able to submit the final project by the due date in about 2 hours. If this issue is not addressed I will need to consider adjusting my star rating.This experience casts a negative impression for me on the Coursera platform and University of Toronto teaching staff.I'm disappointed.",2
103924,Very nice introductory course!,5
103925,"i had no idea of swift, or even not much idea about oop. Got good idea of swift.. assignments can be improved.",4
103926,A great introductory course to Swift!,4
103927,The debugger video showed some very awesome tools I've never known about. Thanks for mentioning the view hierarchy in debugger mode.,5
103928,Good Course. A bit short but goes straight to the point.,4
103929,Awesome course with great explanation,4
103930,Very interesting for making firsts steps in Swift.,5
103931,Bad Lecturers and instructions.,1
103932,Really good overview of Swift language.,5
103933,"This course is a rare example of how it`s not done. Presentation is unstructured.Seems to be a student project where his professor ""helps"" along to check certain topics the student has to include to get a good grade.",1
103934,"I think this course could be much better without Jack Wu, laughing every few seconds. I would except more professional approach and not videos likely taken on first shot with errors.",2
103935,"Very knowledgeable educators.Course is given in a q&a style which is very very good for a web based course since the questions often are exactly what i want to ask.However, think the course can still be improved, especially in the following aspects.(1) examples in the course are not thought through ahead. Instead, educators came up with them on the spot. that way it may not be the best example to convey the message, plus the videos are made unnecessarily long in this way. Think it's good that for a programming course to show real time programming sometimes. But to do this all the time is a bit too much and therefore inefficient. Comparing to some other courses, think this one could really benefit if the educators could give some thought on how to teach, especially to think from a student perspective.For example: about the capability of overwriting and defining new operators, the example given was to define a knife operator and to overload plus operator to stew vegetables. Both examples do not make much sense to me. Although i did understand that it's nice that one can define his/her own operation/operator, when the examples came I actually got confused -- how do i stew vegetables with code??(2) Some of the quiz questions I don't find useful. For this course I need lots of time to complete the quiz in contrast to other coursera courses I did. This is because i need to actually read the documentation in order to answer the quiz questions since they are really in depth. In this way, to do the quiz is actually the way to learn. But some questions are quite artificial, for example, there's a multi-choice question about ""what are the different ways one can find help...""(3) Finally, I find the video and the quiz very abstract. that it's very difficult to follow without making a line of code myself... Also it is not clear what the educators expect as a pre-requisite for taking this course. Sometimes things are explained as if the listeners have no programming background at all. some other time, a concept is explained so fast I wonder whether i should have known objective-C in order to follow this course...",1
103936,Love it!,5
103937,The format and structure of this class needs some improvement. Having to write some code each weak would be better than answering quizzes and doing the first lines of Swift at the end of the class.,3
103938,"it's nice intro to swift, but i recommend that you'd add reading the swift book from apple as people go through the course, even as ""to understand more"" option, thanks a lot for the course.",4
103939,"Course was the worst I have taken on Coursera. I wish I could have received a refund. The professors were hard to follow, laughed through mistakes and did not do a good job of walking through the course content. I would not recommend this course to anyone.",1
103940,Nice course but a but a bit hard when you have no programming skills. In fact I do have some programming skill and found it hard to follow. I would also add more exercise to do than Quizzes.,4
103941,"The videos were a bit unfocused, but over all I learned a good amount about Swift, and appreciate many of it's design decisions.",4
103942,"Went in a slow pace. Enjoyed the modules, especially final assignment.",3
103943,very poor organized.,1
103944,"The course was very well organized, but the main topics of the course were still covered. The lessons needed to be more structured and not so ad-hoc. The final assignment was peer reviewed, but the feedback (based on student feedback) was not very useful.",3
103945,Great teachers,5
103946,Good compact introduction.,4
103947,Good introduction for us,5
103948,"Was pretty good overall. I feel there was a lack of in-lecture questions in the first few videos. That aside, great course.",4
103949,"Quite fun, easy and quick.But I already had some object oriented programming knowledge.",4
103950,Poor Quality,2
103951,The quality of the course is not as I expected from a Coursera course.,2
103952,"Probably guys did big amount of work, but the course looks extremely raw. Half of lectures time is talking about nothing and it seems that there were no lecture plan before shooting the video. It would have been ok if the course had been free, but I expected much more from it for that price.Thank you for you work, but, I think, you need to keep improving the quality of the course.",2
103953,"I'm dropping this course because it's just SO poorly conceived. Three weeks in, and I can't really articulate what I've actually learned (which leads me to believe that the answer is ""not very much""). The major problem is that this course has no clear objective. And I don't mean that the individual lessons don't have objectives - I actually mean that the entire course doesn't know what it wants to be and the instructors seem to have bypassed this critical question. I have a background in Python, and I was under the impression that this course would teach me how to program in Swift (seems like a fairly straightforward goal). But it isn't that at all. If I were to summarize this course (perhaps a little uncharitably, because I'm annoyed at the time I wasted) it would be: some dudes with a computer talk about some cool features of a programming language. I'm fairly baffled by the fact that there was no thought put into which examples might best illustrate the features they were trying to teach. Which-examples-might-best-illustrate-the-feature-I-am-trying-to-teach is pedagogy 101. They would regularly work through examples just to conclude ""actually that's a bad example"". This is pretty strong evidence that there was no lesson planning involved. There were also no practice exercises, no posting of pieces of illustrative code, and hence, no way to actually get good at programming in Swift (unless it's self directed, in which case - why bother with the formality of taking a course on Coursera?).",1
103954,Too difficult to learn for beginners.,1
103955,Need to record the sessions again with more confidence and less errors,1
103956,"Nice course, but would be better if the examples were thought through before demonstration, rather than do it extempore.",4
103957,"I am sure if you are familiar with the content or an expert programmer looking for an overview of a new language then this would be perfect but you do need to understand swift before starting this introduction to swift.The lessons felt very unstructured, unplanned and ad hoc almost like the people presenting didn't know they were being recorded, this meant that the examples given were contrived without consideration to the suitability to present the concept succinctly and would require anyone but an existing swift programmer needing to carry out additional reading which rather defeats the purpose of an ""introduction to..."" course.A little scripting and lesson planning and preparation of content would have made the difference between this excellently produced and edited course being awkward and an effort to attend into a really useful reference for beginers of swift programming.To summarise, the obviously expert technical knowledge of the speakers and the quality of the editing are let down by rushed lesson content.",2
103958,"Please avoid to take this course! Lessons seems to be, at least, not prepared by the teachers.",1
103959,good overview and introduction to Swift,5
103960,"Unfortunately the course is not very well thought out. The lecture videos are poorly organized, concepts are not presented in the proper context and lack sufficient detail/depth, little thought or effort was put into designing the examples in the videos, there are no actual coding exercises until the last week, there are no examples of elegant code, nor thoughtful examples of good vs. bad code, the quizzes contain questions that are poorly worded and ambiguous (and I think some actually have the wrong answers and are contradicted by other online resources). It's very high level, and they hand-wave important concepts. I really don't see how this class can actually teach you to build a robust high-quality app. You're probably better off just reading some of the official documentation online.",1
103961,this is terrible,1
103962,not well prepared course,1
103963,great ability to learn iOS,5
103964,"After 97% of the work completed, I have to admit that this course is NOT GOOD. The instructor is not actually the professor himself, and they do lots of mistakes in the videos. You do not learn anything that helpful, and perhaps the actual Swift documentation is way more clearer than this course is.",1
103965,"poorly planned, irrelevant to the subject test questions.",1
103966,The course seemed not to be prepared with anticipation. I left it because of that.,1
103967,"This course was little more than a haphazard, ambling preview of a tiny bit of Swift. There was some useful content in the class but the organization was poor and there was almost no evidence of course design or use of the teaching techniques I expected to see from a major university. The best section of the course was week 5, where they syntax of Objective-C and Swift were superficially compared. That section did give some clear opinions on why Swift should be chosen over Objective-C for new development. The other sections just contained too many confusing, unrehearsed diversions into esoteric topics to be of much use. I ended getting more out of the Apple documentation on Swift than I did from this class.However, the instructors have received ample feedback of this nature and they do seem genuinely concerned with improving the course. Assuming that they will make major improvements for the next round and noting that Coursera's infrastructure is excellent, don't be scared to take the class. The email reminders from Coursera about assignments, etc... kept me on track and kept me in the class.",2
103968,Submission is buggy and final assignment is confusing. Almost more than half of students failed this course because of it.,1
103969,"Classes were entertaining, but sometimes a little messy.",4
103970,Great as a free course. Would want more material and practical exercises for a paid course.,5
103971,"Not the worst, but I did not think this was a well developed course. It felt like an informal conversation between the instructors with one of them repeatedly calling different aspects of Swift ""cool"". It was very distracting. I also thought the tests were vaguely worded and the final assignment was long and definitely more than the 30 minutes it said it would take to complete it. I am all for difficult challenges, but it felt like the final project was badly designed/described. Un-enrolling.",2
103972,Hope next courses will be more detailed.It is hard to understand some things without experience.,4
103973,Quality and length of material is mediocre.,1
103974,"Poor video quality, weak, ad hoc examples, not well thought flow. Seems like tutors have not spent time on proper preparation. Free courses on iTunesU (especially those by Stanford University) are far more better.",2
103975,Felt like the teachers weren't putting much time into preparation - felt random and disorganized. I didn't finish the course - I'll watch the cs193p lectures from Stanford instead.,2
103976,Great course!!,5
103977,"No stars for this course, 3 modules I did, and I think is not a valuable course, gives a bad introduction to the language, there are inconsistencies in the theory and knowledge of the language. The preparation of the course is poor, there is no direction, a lot of errors using playground and the instructors hesitate and doubt all the time during the recording of the screen. That's not good point for the prestigious University of Toronto and Coursera. One star for the review is too much, no preparation, lack of security, bad quality.",1
103978,"Somewhat useful, but suffers from what seems to be bad planning and a general lack of focus.",3
103979,Awesome! I've been looking for the relevant courses for a long time. I can't find any better course that this one.,5
103980,This course really need examples in final assignment,3
103981,Basically a couple of guys have an unorganized discussion about swift. Little to no organization with poor coordination between lectures and quizzes.. Appears that there is no TA or course staff monitoring discussion boards... I am glad I didn't pay for the class... Disappointed though because I really wanted to learn Swift.,1
103982,Professors talk too fast and in an English for those who do not speak often difficult. Extra Stress: swift and English,3
103983,"Unnecessary with the Swift vs Objective C session, did not provide any value - otherwise fairly good basic course",4
103984,"Teachers poorly prepared, explanations ambiguous, it seems that they didn't pay attention to examples and sound of the course.I love Jack Wu written tutorials... way better than videos.",1
103985,"This course is not as polished as most other courses on coursera. They occasionally give examples that are too small to see in the video. Most of the quizes dealt with syntax. I don't feel like any new skill was developed in taking it. If you are interested in iOS programming take the University of California, Irvine versions of this class.",2
103986,I wish I had paid closer attention to the refund policy. The production quality and content did not meet my expectations.,1
103987,"Lectures are careless prepared. It's really hard to follow this course without previous background in iOS development, despite it's called ""Introduction To Swift Programming"". There are a lot of small misleadings notes in course materials. Hope the next course in specialization ""iOS App Development with Swift"" would be much better.",2
103988,"I'm giving just a single star. I started this course with high hopes, bailed after the third quiz as I wasn't learning anything except how to pass the quiz. Sorry, but this was a major letdown to myself and two other colleagues who all signed up to take it together. We all bailed.",1
103989,The instructors are not well prepared for the course. The material are not well structured.,1
103990,"Tedious introduction, delayed second week. Hope that the following section will be better.",3
103991,"Sadly, this course is NOT an Introduction to Swift Programming. As a beginner I found this course was not structured and I was confused about the correct steps to take in order to start programming in Swift. No doubt that these guys are knowledgable but they do not plan the course or teach in a linear fashion. Furthermore the sound and video quality is poor and I have decided to quit this course after the first week and a half.",1
103992,"Good way to start learning swift. I hope other concepts will be explained in the next courses, but I have to say this course is held very well.",4
103993,"Very disorganized. More than a course, it seems more like 2 students learning along with you. The lessons have 0 preparation and they come up with examples that do not work half of the time during the video itself. I do not recommend this course (and as a matter of fact, the entire specialization) to anyone.",1
103994,It seems the instructor Jack Wu didn't prepare the course material.,1
103995,The lectures for this course seem unorganized and often had poor audio. The content covered in many lectures seemed off topic. Quiz questions would then focus on the off topic information making it confusing with regard to what material to focus on during a lecture. Do I focus on the proposed subject of the video or the many tangents about other topics. This combined with the unorganized nature of videos(just winging it) made the lectures distracting. The lecture videos are full of code that simply does not work in the real world and help from staff takes literally days to get(and not just over the weekend).,2
103996,"A resource if your starting with Swift. Video quality is often poor. Examples are a bit too contrived. Generally, presentations should be better prepared, too much figuring things out during the video. Good choice of project for the practical.Many interesting coding practice tidbits along the way but needs polish.",3
103997,Great course and great instructor,5
103998,Awesome basic course,4
103999,"The course need more improvements in terms of material, presentation and execution. The two presenters format didn't work well as it made the lecture look informal. The material need better preparation and it seems at times to be ad-hoc coding. A few videos were not edited properly resulting in lengthy black screens after the presenters were done talking.",2
104000,"I do appreciate the effort put into this course, but as a programming course it is not very didactic.It lacks structure and even the names of classes chosen for the examples seem odd.",1
104001,Bad audio qualityPoor presentationNot for professional developers (perhaps can be fine for beginners),1
104002,Poorly prepared course. Lectutets do not have enough qualified to teach others. It's a shame to pay for this money. I do not expect this from the university of Toronto.,1
104003,"This course is poorly designed. What course on a programming language jumps first into how to use the debugger and what went wrong with a program? You are not introducing Swift, you are introducing xcode (and doing a terrible job of it). Also, I have been using xcode and Swift for 8 months now and producing some really good work, but I could only get 3/7 on your quiz because you have written questions with the purpose of tricking people instead of reinforcing or checking knowledge of the content.When you teach a new application, consider introducing the interface first. Explain what the various areas are, what they are needed for, and how to control them. This orients the user in the application and helps them to find their way around when they are trying to reinforce your teachings later.The presentation for this course is so unprofessional. It's like a running commentary on a movie instead of an educational presentation. I felt like I was listening to two geeks stuffing around and having a good time, instead of people who are professional teachers!I'm so incredibly disappointed with this course. Back to the wonderful work of Paul Hegarty from Stanford University on iTunes University and YouTube for me.University of Toronto - you should really consider what your teaching staff are doing before you unleash them on the world.",1
104004,"I'm sorry but the presentations were very poor and unprepared.The first quiz focused on rather unimportant and stuff which was NOT PRESENTED in videos, like keyboard shortcuts etc.Do not recommend.",1
104005,"The material is OK, the video quality is regular and the instructors are childish. I prefer the Android specialization where the instructors are more mature and professional.",3
104006,"First of all I expected something deeper. First of all this courser is less understandable than ""The Swift Programming Language"" free book from Apple. Before I join the course I have read a few chapters and from my point of view book explains material much much better. The second point – it looks like tutors invent examples during the lesson (on the fly), this is bring a mess. And last thing about this course that tutors commit an gross error during lecture. Please have a look at ""Advanced Swift"" lecture, I am talking about closures. The teacher said that closure captures the copy of outside variable, but this is completely wrong! Closures capture the variable itself, not the variable value",1
104007,"I am dropping the course.Suggestions1) One person talk to the audience...rather than 2 or 3 talking to each other2) Volume and pic quality poor3) Its going too slowly.....just not enough ""meat"" to get me engaged...esp if u compare to the course by Paul Hegarty Stanford",1
104008,It felt like amateur course. the volume was very low and was missing videos,1
104009,They taught NOTHING!,1
104010,"The professors did no prepared the classes. They make so many mistakes in the video lectures and they also laughts in the middle of the course and they send a non-professional feeling to the students. The content of the course is very good, but the proffesors could really do better.",2
104011,I had awesome experience while studying a t this course. Must-attend in case you are interested in society psychology,5
104012,Interesting topic. Worth considering.,5
104013,"Great course, very practical and a great pack of skills which will help me interpret problems better, especially ones involving multiple people (which is basically all problems.)",5
104014,"Excellent course, provides tools needed to design applications based on social networks",5
104015,You will thank yourself for taking this course up. Assignments in this course are very well designed to give you a real experience. You have the best faulty here.,5
104016,"I enjoyed this course the most in the specialization so far. I think it could be awesome as a Part 1 and Part 2, or maybe you all could offer an Advanced Social Computing course. This is such an interesting topic, and it's a huge part of how new technologies are being incorporated into the way we collaborate in many areas of social and professional life.",5
104017,This was an excellent primer on how social collaboration and crowdsourcing works. Gave a good understanding of the concepts involved when creating such platforms.,5
104018,The course has very good material especially in terms of crowdsourcing. Gave me really good insights in social thinking and how to relate it to your product,5
104019,good course,4
104020,It is a great class. But I would like to see more examples and related learning material.,5
104021,"Good course, great to begin understanding social computing.",5
104022,i really like the crowd sourcing part. Thank you for the great class. I have learned a lot.This is my 4th one completed in this serial. Looking forward to the next one!,5
104023,"Content was thin and none of it felt immediately actionable - felt like more of a ""hey isn't this cool"" series of videos rather than something that could be used by a professional.",2
104024,"Great way to learn about subtleties of working with global teams around the world and excel in these environments. As well, the details and how to leverage the power of crow",4
104025,This course was very usable and important to know.,5
104026,I found the social computing session was interesting,5
104027,"Good explanation of concepts, would be better if add more interaction",4
104028,This course was not interesting compared to the others in the specialization. The long section on crowdsourcing seemed very unrelated/unnecessary.,2
104029,Really enjoyed this course and found it very enlightening.,5
104030,I loved learning more about social computation and the power of contributions by many people to reach a common design solution.,5
104031,I learned a lot! :) thanks coursera and mentors!,5
104032,interesting course. Leaves you wanting to read and learn more about social computing.,4
104033,"This is one of the most interesting courses I've come across in a while. Although not a Design course, it is very much relevant to the Internet industry today since most of the social networks employ features that have evolved from the process of Design.",5
104034,"Great course, but a bit short.",4
104035,A bit basic,2
104036,Some of the evaluation methods just allow other people how doesn't do to much work to just pass...,3
104037,"I found the course very interesting. The weekly assignments were a great challenge, but lacked reference to some reading on the subject.When I went quiz I've found that most of the questions had to do with concepts that weren't covered in the videos. I think that this courser should have further readings about these concepts.",4
104038,Hope recommend some more reading,3
104039,"All the videos and assignments were interesting and informative, I am just not sure how relevant they were to the specialization.",5
104040,"I thought this was going to be a more comprehensive course about crowdsourcing and using social media to aid the design process. Maybe I missed something, but it fell a little short of the mark for me.",3
104041,relevant and useful,5
104042,"Great course. Do not forget to submit your work on time, otherwise you will not be graded.",5
104043,I really enjoyed this class a lot! The assignments directly tested the weekly material and I thought they were useful activities. The end quiz was good to re-think the entire course and reflect on all of the material we learned.,5
104044,Very interesting topic!,5
104045,"Really interesting course. Good introduction to the dynamics of group behavior and collaboration. Nice overview of advantages of crowdsourcing, but no mention of any ethical or economic concerns.",5
104046,Interesting assignments,5
104047,"I've had to guess a lot of things, video explanations were not up to the level of the assignments (I don't look for easier assignments but broader explanations).the last week assignment on crowdsourcing it's cool but for example Mechanical Turk take 48hrs to validate you before you could start, so if you start the assignment on friday you'll barely make it and if you had time until saturday(because you work) you are doomed.",2
104048,Very useful and thought provoking course.,4
104049,Loved the course! Will definitely try to get my hands on further material to study more.,4
104050,Very informational . I personally learnt a lot.,5
104051,"Assignments are not well prepared: forms are not helping either people accomplishing the assignment, or the people reviewing their work.We have to go back and forth to review the question answered in both cases (when filling-out or reviewing), and sometimes notation criteria are not clear upfront.Please review the assignments and improve them, because it was really frustrating.",2
104052,Gotta watch how the test questions are formulate as it can be overly deceiving......,4
104053,the assignments wasn't that good,4
104054,THE COURSE IS GOOD.,4
104055,The teacher is not very good at explaining things in simpler terms. The lessons were kind of hard to understand.,3
104056,Excellent Course. I really like the explanation and the topics. I 've learned a lot,5
104057,Good course. Especially enjoyed the crowdsourcing lectures.,4
104058,"I think this course was inspiring and motivating. I learned a lot regarding the social computing, learned about websites I haven't heard till now, l found more about exploring and searching and the utilization of internet tools. The only reason I gave this course 4 stars is because one of my assignments (week 2 that is), did not get any reviews....Thank you for the experience!",4
104059,Amazing course with a lot of secrets about social computing from USA to other countries :),5
104060,It was interesting to learn via Coursera. My very first time online course ever and I enjoyed it. :),5
104061,This is one of the most innovative courses that I have seen. It really helped in thinking out of box.,5
104062,"Great first lessons, I'll have started.",5
104063,Introducing some guest speakers was a very good addition to the course. It's always great to get many perspectives.,5
104064,Thank youCoursera classes made me successful in the workplace.,5
104065,"UVA and Darden are the best. UVA and Darden are not ranked as the top pubic university and best public business school in the world by several major publications for nothing. I've even studied at Harvard and UVA is way better IMO, plus a nicer campus.",5
104066,"I had benefited this course a lot ,interviews were great ,a lot of insights .Really good",4
104067,"The course was a great introduction into the subject of strategic planning and execution. I really appreciated the very high quality course replication, clear speech and sufficient detailed slides to accompany the subject matter.",4
104068,This has given a great insights for my consulting careerF M CassimFMC Consulting,5
104069,"Practical, useful, with some guest speaker course, which cement all previous and helps to use all previous Strategy toolkit in practice. me like",5
104070,Love it!!!,5
104071,One of the best mooc's ever!,5
104072,"Excellent course as excellent is THE STRATEGIST'S TOOLKIT book (my guide, my advisor). What I am lerning with Professor Lenox is really of a great value because when I hear his lesson automatically, come to my head many ideas that allow me to see my failures and mistakes that I will try not to repeat again, and at the same time, new ideas flow to be analysed and decide wheather or not to be put in practice for better results.",5
104073,Wonderfully insightful and relevant contents.... I could apply them to my company fully ...,5
104074,"Very clear concepts, excelent presentation, students with intermediate english level. can perfectly understand all the lessons.",5
104075,An excellent understanding of roadmap for strategy planning,5
104076,Cutting-edge concepts and practical applications!! Strongly recommend.,5
104077,"Great course, very practical and useful. You can really apply it in real life situations. I like the fact that you brought in Darden graduates.",5
104078,Great course!,5
104079,"Great course, teacher and content.",5
104080,Very useful course,5
104081,Very Good Insights and tools.,5
104082,"Great materials, variety of speakers, lectures,examples and models !! Thank you.",4
104083,I found this course useful as it corresponds to many approaches that I use or intend to use in my work on understanding the life cycles of technologies. The course instructors have carefully compiled relevant examples to make it easy to understand many tricky concepts. Tutorials at the end of 3rd and 4th week are pretty useful.I would love to attend a course with more involvement of students through peer assignments etc.,5
104084,Broadens my view of how to solve public health problems involving multiple stakeholders and actors,4
104085,A very hands on approach to systems thinking that introduces you to modeling software for real life use.,4
104086,Very comprehensive and insightful,5
104087,Good coverage of vast topic in crisp manner,5
104088,"Every one in charge of leading, coordinating, managing public health activities, especially at higher level &/or in developing countries, must take such training. Because this helps any one to avoid rigidity in using his/her authority or helps understand what effects might have their decisions in the community and starts to think contextually plus systematically.Every one is not right or wrong there should be a check up mechanism in order to converge every ones perspectives included in the system and at least respected to minimise later on resistance for the success our ""good mission"".",4
104089,It was a great course tat not only teaches you the theory behind systems thinking but it also teaches you how to use some tools (software) to use systems thinking approach to solve problems.,5
104090,"This is a very good introductory course into systems thinking. It provides the basics to understand this approach, with a right balance between being easy and deepening in the subject enough to be interesting.",5
104091,"Fantastic course, quite tricky but great to extend my thinking about health systems!",5
104092,thanks,5
104093,It was a great dive into system thinking. It can be used not only in Public Health but also in other fields. Nice course.,5
104094,"An excellent course with great information regarding public health.. great to learn, thanks..",5
104095,"For everyone involved in Public Health (and not only), complexity is obvious. Dealing with complexity is not! This highly pedagogical course offers all the necessary knowledge and tools to deal with it, while leaving behind the linear abstractive way of thinking. The lectures are analytical, highly informative, finely structured and well focused. Not boring even for a moment. I highly recommend it!",5
104096,Unbelievably valuable course. So many insights and introductions to useful tools. Highly recommended.,5
104097,"There was a lot I liked about this course, especially the weeks focusing on background and theory. However, about half the course focused too much on the software that could be used for systems analyses in public health. I would have preferred more of an overview of systems thinking and less diving into the nitty gritty of technology. The other systems course (Systems Science and Obesity) seemed to balance these aspects much better - and moved the technical aspects to labs.",3
104098,Very good class - many examples brought in to the lectures and exercises help with comprehension.,5
104099,I enjoyed this course very much. I rate 4/5 because I would liked a broader explanation on how to translate Stock and Flow Diagrams to mathematical models.,4
104100,"I have learned a lot throughout this course, and this course gave me the epiphany that Public Health is what I earnestly want to study in college. The way of using the background knowledge from various subjects was definitely awe-inspiring. It felt like learning macroeconomics integrated with history and biology. It was truely a novel experience. I am so glad I chose to take this course!",5
104101,I thought this course was top notch - the lectures were very well designed and course production quality was first rate. An excellent introduction to an important subject area.,5
104102,Each week is a very light overview of a topic. There is little to no connection between the topics. The course is not rigorous enough. I felt at the end of the course I didn't learn anything.,1
104103,A very useful course that gives one the opportunity to learn a practical and structured approach to analyzing problems within the health sector and coming up with appropriate solutions that involve the participation of all the relevant stakeholders.,5
104104,Dry and boring as hell.,2
104105,It was a nice and informative experience. It was a good introductory to basic concepts and skills which base the way for further reading on the subject.,4
104106,A course with a good concept,5
104107,As usually Johns Hopkins offers very disappointing courses because of their boring lectures and senseless quizzes.,1
104108,"I had rated the course earlier but would like to amend my statement. By some uncanny chance, I have just managed to pass the final assignment on my fourth try, which means I have passed my course. I still believe my original observations are valid. Thank you.",3
104109,Very well done. Meeting my expectations. Very useful the material provided.,5
104110,"This course is excellent, have a very interesting videos and the information is excellent",5
104111,this course really open my mind on systems thinking.,5
104112,"While focused on the subject of public health systems, this course is also a good experience for anybody who is simply interested in the benefits of systems thinking and the applications of causal models. While there are a few hiccups in the course content (a couple files not available as of Mar 2016), the overall experience here is excellent. The instructors break down each topic into understandable elements and provide excellent real world examples. Overall, I greatly enjoyed this course and recommend it to others.",4
104113,"An overview of concepts and models of how networks form. There are applicable with basic concepts from probability theory, statistics, and some light calculus astonishingly well.",5
104114,Lucidly taught by Prof. Jackson. I learned a whole deal of stuff that helps me make sense of some of the literature in economics that uses ideas from network analysis. My background is in economics (Master's degree).,5
104115,"Very comprehensive as an introductory course. The content is very actual and the lectures' flow is objective. Also, I liked the quiz inside the lectures as they helped in retain the subject. I have some hard difficulties with the mathematics as I'm very rusty with the mathematics (more than 30 years of rust). I'm from the compute science area so I would like to see more practice in algorithms. However, I would like to congratulate the Stanford University and Cousera teams for the course. Great job.",4
104116,Thank you so so much for doing this. One step at a time towards universal education.,5
104117,"A very good introduction in social and economic networks.I recommend this course to everyone that wants to learn how networks are formed, understand the basic concepts and get an intuition on the possible networks that he/she could form.The professor is talking clearly so you won't have a problem in understanding him.One thing that was missing for me was in Week 2 when he was talking about ""eigenvector centrality"", for me the most objective measure, the explanation was really poor and you could never understand the concept based on what the lesson offered.",4
104118,"Easier to understand network structure, utilities, equilibrium after illustration. Interesting and attracting course to take.",5
104119,Fantastic and interesting course.,5
104120,The course is vast. The Professor is to the point and doesn't lack knowledge in his field.I'd recommend this course for anyone interested in Economics. Loved it.,4
104121,"A bit tough, but really worth the effort.",4
104122,Excellent course for both advanced micro theory PhD learners who wants to go deep into the prove and master (and up) level learner who wants to have a flavour of Network Theory. Professor Jackson is great in interpreting the intuition behind the theory and prove. This 8 weeks are great learning experience for me!,5
104123,Very intresting,5
104124,Very interesting and comprehensive coverage of networks.,5
104125,"Matt, is awesome. Exercises are helpful so you can get the basics of what you need to learn. Also, complementary lectures and videos for advanced students are very helpful. I think there should be a follow up course to get an understanding on current research. So exciting!",5
104126,Excellent. Completely changed how I perceive the world.,5
104127,Great course!It's a theoretical course and it's definitely harder than many of the other courses offered on Coursera. The quizzes and final exam are definitely doable but understanding everything perfectly is not an easy task. The professor is very clear. I highly recommend this course.,5
104128,"Very complex topic, very well presented. The materials are great! Would have been better to made mathematics pre-requisite clearer.",4
104129,"The course is exceptional, I just wish the instructor would also include chapters that could help researchers in the field.",5
104130,Great!!,5
104131,A beautiful course that is mathematically rigorous and requires great understanding. Thank you :),5
104132,"Great course by Matt Jackson, who is one of the leading scholars in this area! Thanks!",5
104133,"Excellent course. The material is very well presented. You get the chance to understand the intuitions behind many concepts relating to SNA in a very systematic manner. Can serve as a good basis for M.Sc or Phd level students that are interested to explore this area. The evaluation process is really well defined and the length of course is really appropriate.Thanks,Prokopis",5
104134,The course is a helpful first step in the field of network science. Presenting clearly many complex ideas that are important for understanding current research.,5
104135,"It's a quiet complex topic in general terms. It is well covered, but In my opinion there should be at least an exercise per video, explaining something similar to the in-video questions. It should have a demonstrative part rather than just talking about it and showing the formula.",4
104136,"Nice course, well paced, great teacher!",5
104137,A great course which gives an overall idea regarding the tools required to study networks and its applications.,5
104138,"Very good course on Social Networks, and also a hard one even for graduate level. Generally assignments are not too tough but fully understanding all the concepts take lots of extra readings.",5
104139,"A very usefull course very different from others. Although for coursera standars, its very extensive and not so basic, that´s why I think its great",5
104140,Thank you! IT was a pleasure for me to be part of this course!,5
104141,Without any discussion forum and at least a mentor this course has nothing new to offer than a You Tube video. There are some inconsistency in the materials as well. Alluring student by the name of UCI and giving the students the worst is hypocrisy.,1
104142,I found significant improvement of my grammar after having attended.,4
104143,"I liked fun videos, some explanations and teachers. But the quality has really disappointed :( A huge amount of misprints in printable exercises, a few grammar mistakes in the answers, mistakes in the execution of the online exercises. The part about passive tenses is only about one tense Past Simple. And the whole design is really destructing! Awful typefaces, different styles, different colors. I enjoyed some explanation in videos and fun teachers, but in general, I'm really happy I haven't paid for this course.",2
104144,"Really usefull if you have some english knowledge, but you are not absolutely sure if you are using the correct tense. Videos are really fun! I love the teachers!!",5
104145,"Very helpful, I am so enjoy!",5
104146,It is a wonderful course!!!,5
104147,It is really well organized!,5
104148,This is very helpful. Thank you.,5
104149,Thanks to nice girls for this enjoyable course. I really had fun completing it. Many examples for exercises were funny and unusual.,5
104150,"The course is well structured and quite informative. Instructors bring in real life situations to use different tenses, this is helpful for the learners as it is relatable. The only draw back is that our work is corrected by the other learners and that correction is final. I scored 98% in the final assignment as the other learners assessed it and they didn't give me the correct score. I wish I could appeal to re-check it!",4
104151,It is an excellent course. I really improved my English learning process. Thanks for the group of instructors.,5
104152,"This course is amazing!!! Just do it! You will learn everything you need about verbs. Don't quit or run with the exercises. Take your time, and like me, you will have your reward! A great thanks to the teachers! They are fantastic! I laughed a lot watching some of the videos! It really works!",5
104153,thank you,5
104154,It is good but it will be more effective if it has more exercises. Thank you!,5
104155,great course,5
104156,There is no any Discusson forums in there. It's so disappointing. I've paid for course and unable to ask questions.,2
104157,The teachers are simply great! The methods used in this lecture are really productive. Thank you!,5
104158,This is one of the excellent course I have ever attend.,5
104159,"This is the very useful course with the good explanations, teachers, funny examples and video. With this course, the grammar is easy to learn. You will not be bored during the education. You will certainly enjoy it! I like Emily and Jake's teaching very much. And my favorite joke is about Johnny Depp. Ha ha",5
104160,Thank you! a great course!,5
104161,"very well explained, very funny videos, thanks",5
104162,A great teacher and a great course on Tang poems! Highly recommended!!,5
104163,Just excellent! Great simulation!,5
104164,It was a great course. Very challenging!,5
104165,"Superb Course,Enjoyed learning :)",5
104166,Great Course!!,5
104167,Very fun and educating Capstone project! I can really recommend this course to everyone who is new to software product management.,5
104168,"I learned really useful things about software project/product management and I hope to use these concepts to get a full-time role. The capstone was really intensive and there were a lot of assignments, but you will get to go through what happens during sprints.",5
104169,What an awesome course! I learned so much that I can apply to my everyday career! Thank you so much University of Alberta!,5
104170,Great practice for theory achieved by 5 courses,5
104171,"I think it was a wonderful experience.I liked the theory introduction of Course 1 when we learned about the Agile Manifesto and we have been teach why processes, requirements, planning and monitoring matter. Personally, it was a nice review for what I have learned in my mastering and, earlier, when taking my Bachelor’s degree.I also enjoyed the Course 2, specially when it came to Agile methodologies explanation. I learned many things about Lean and Scrum practices that I hadn’t known or I hadn’t remembered by that time.Course 3 is, by far, the one I enjoyed and learned more. In my mastering thesis I used a lot of usability techniques, I also studied many of these and I kinda enjoyed the way wireframes were emphasized. The exercise to draw a wireframe was awesome. It was really fun to do it and check what my colleagues did. It was also nice to learn about user stories standards and acceptance tests, I am using a lot of what we learned in my current job.Course 4 was cool, too. I liked to see many techniques working together, such as WBS, User Story points, Pert Charts and so on. However, I felt a little bit lost when I was taking the course, not knowing exactly where was the exact place of each technique. I am very experienced with project management, so it was not that hard, but I was wondering about my colleagues who were seeing these subjects for, maybe, the first or second time in their lives. I think it could be the most tiring course, even though the topics were pretty important and very well explained.Course 5 was a good one. It’s not everybody who gives attention to monitoring and retrospectives. As far as retrospectives is concerned, it was really nice to learn every step we should go over in this kind of meeting. I have been working in this field for a while and I have never seen a project retrospective taking place, so it was nice to learn about this and realize it could work if we put some energy on it.Course 6. The Capstone Project. It was amazing. By far the best course of these six. Every week was pretty good, with a good amount of scenarios and practices. I loved the “RPG” style of the simulations, also, it was really nice going over each sprint, checking, working and changing the plans accordingly. You guys from Alberta rocked, as far as this capstone is concerned.I wish you could put more of this kind of practice along the whole course. Sometimes the exercises of the courses 1 to 5 were too much theoretical, so it would be nice to see this kind of “capstone scenario applied to that”. Also, I think it would be nice to take a “Capstone Part 2” course where other problems could arise and we can face harder practices. I noticed as you guys from Alberta that the forum was a little bit quiet. I think one way to make it more active is to put the students in situations that they are not so sure about, so they will be “obligated” to discuss. I think this “advanced capstone” could do that. This is my suggestion, I hope you think about it!Finally, it was a pleasure to be with you and learn everything I learned. I don’t regret that I decided to take the whole specialization. Also, i want to say thank you all my colleagues who spent time checking my answers and my mistakes. I learned a lot from you too, guys!",5
104172,"Very well designed, interesting content and very responsive staff!",5
104173,"Very good, entertaining, not that easy, learning a lot, and achievable.",5
104174,The Capstone was very nice....better than I expected.,5
104175,It was excellent!,5
104176,Excellent! Just enrol and do it. The best course/specialization in Coursera so far.,5
104177,The formation is greater opportunity get more knowledge in Software Product.,5
104178,Great experience! You'll learn a lot!,5
104179,Excellent capstone to end the course!,5
104180,Very good simulation of real software development activities.,5
104181,Could have made it more interesting,3
104182,Amazing experience ..great lesson,5
104183,"Well planned and with exciting activities, the capstone was a great final step for the course!",4
104184,Exellent Capstone by simulating a problem and working in a solution of what was learned over the past several months.,5
104185,Excellent practical projects. Well run and great interactive tools.,5
104186,Awesome course!,5
104187,Amazing and very helpful the course!,5
104188,Capstone was very well put together and by far the highlight of the course! Amazing job by the course developers to create such an interactive finale to the course that brought together all the concepts into a real world simulation!,5
104189,Nice one.,5
104190,very well planned.,5
104191,Very thorough and reality-based! Loved the scenario-based training approach!,5
104192,Awesome practical experience. Wonderful.,5
104193,I really like it! It helped me to established the abilities to create a game-world.,5
104194,Simply Awesome.,4
104195,Great course!,5
104196,Excelent! But I miss the interaction with the teacher.,4
104197,The teacher guided us to the basic of game world design. Give us the material of how to design the game world.,4
104198,"Very useful to develop worlds and enviroments, not only for videogames, but for all kind of media.",4
104199,Great courses,5
104200,awsome!!,5
104201,"Before enrolling this course, I expected to obtain some technical skills for creating game environments by different software products, etc. I was surprised: this course teaches the future professionals to THINK ! One can't produce anything without know what he would make. This course will give you clear direction of your ideas about YOUR GAME environement. Like in the drawing: you should know what you would draw. Having the ""color palette"" is nothing without structuring in your mind your ideas, planning what you would do. Similarly is in my profession - architecture - there are some already graduated students who can only to draft what somebody else tells them to draft. This course will teach you how to create.",5
104202,Definitely a challenging course but I enjoyed it very much and learned a lot!,5
104203,This course was amazing and great. I loved it. It helped me so much with my own project :D,5
104204,"This is an excellent way to learn the steps of approaching BG design. I entered this course not having the slightest clue of how to start research, and now I feel I have a much better grasp on it thanks to this course. I think my favorite assignment was looking up all the reference photos (project 2?) and explaining what they meant to our game and how they fit in not just with the game mission but related to our characters too. I would like to take another class, focusing on drawing/creating the backgrounds now.",5
104205,"Good course content. However, the classes feel a little short for such a long topic.",4
104206,"The content from the instructor is very, very brief. Maybe this is just a simple introduction course but it also seems like the topics are covered in a very vague, abstract way with little exploration on a deeper level. The assignments are really good though, great projects for sparking the creative process.",3
104207,"Great course! A lot of new and useful stuff. I really enjoyed another part of Game Design: Art and Concepts Specialization. Keep up the great work, guys!",5
104208,"Absolutely fun, with work that makes you think a bit outside of the box.",5
104209,"A very poor course. The teacher just ask questions in order to stimulate students, but doesn't teach anything. Incorrect terminology (Ah-ah? Please, study Aaron Allston works before inventing other words).Test are cool.",2
104210,I loved this I think video game design and creation is the new way to learn code and complexity of design. Great experience thank you so much!,5
104211,This course is very good and you can learn a lot of knowledge.Then you can design a better game.,5
104212,Amazing course to get ideas for your world designs,5
104213,Very good. Excellent teacher - I strongly recommend.,5
104214,Contents were short and great but some tools and practicle s/w should be introduced in it.,4
104215,A totally great course that makes clear the concepts we should be careful with when developing video games.,5
104216,Gives you a lot to think about and ideas to Build! Build! Build!,5
104217,Fantastic! The coursework and lessons were designed to get you started building the framework for your game world. The course got me started on my new game!,5
104218,"Great course, I really get a lot of information about how to create a feel in a world!",5
104219,The course material provide good reference and study for world design.,5
104220,"Unlike the other two lecturers in this course, this module's lecture is very very bad. I always felt like coming back and learning more with the other two lectures but with this one I had to force myself to complete the lessons. First of all his English is bad, sometimes you cant understand what he means even with subtitles. He repeats many things through out the course and he tries to teach by asking questions all the time. As a guy who takes and make his own notes, I found it really difficult to put together a sentence he was saying. It seems that nobody proof read his lectures before posting it on coursera. I feel that it was done blindly and in a rushed way. If possible can you please change the videos and also the script. Please make it more understandable.",2
104221,it's Fun and worth the time,5
104222,The assignments and theory are interesting enough to get you started on world design.,3
104223,"Very intresting and fun, learned a lot. I just wish there´d be more examples of finished designers worlds and how they look like.",4
104224,"articulation needs to be improved, talked too fast, content doesn't give much",2
104225,Very poor content. Everything is already said in last courses in this specialization. Also they didnt gave any techniques or tips how to easier create game worlds,2
104226,I feel like the lectures were short summaries - not actual college level lectures. I really don't feel I learned anything.,1
104227,I like the course,5
104228,"I learned next to nothing from this course; the professor just rambles on and on jumping schizophrenically from aspect of aspect. One moment he's talking about physics, and in the same sentence he's suddenly talking about whether the game should have a crafting system. Some of the information even seems out of touch.He doesn't state any information with certainty because he always tends to add ""or not!"" or ""...maybe!"" after sentences, leaving you to wonder if there's anything left to take away from the lessons. The entire course could be condensed down into a ""list of questions to think about while designing your game world"" - it really doesn't contain anything more than that.Sometimes entire segments are dedicated to trivial things (such as ""your game could have invisible walls!""), whereas in other segments he works through a hundred different questions without going in-depth to any of them.Speaker is hard to understand due to his lack of proficiency with the English language and the subtitles are often incorrect.On the plus side, you will learn what a ""ha-ha"" is.",1
104229,"Great course, excited :)",5
104230,explanation of fundamenals,5
104231,"Enjoyable course with engaging presentation. I really enjoyed the assignments which encouraged me to actually try out the concepts, without getting too hung up on it being perfect. I also appreciated the assignment examples that were provided - it helped give me a guide as to how detailed or not I should be each week, and gave me",5
104232,This is a very cool and informative course.,5
104233,"Even though it is a great course by itself, I have to look at it as a part of the whole specialization, and in that context it's just a little bit more abstract and undefined than the previous ones.All in all, great course and fantastic specialization for now.",4
104234,"Great Course, highly recommended, great explanations and nice ideas to help you think diffently about level and world design, concise and clear and has creative exercises. Loved it.",5
104235,"In general the course was really good, I just had the problem that some points weren't as clearly explained as I wished them to be. It's a bit hard to follow up, since sometimes the examples are not what is asked for in the homework and there's nothing to compare your work to, so the student as well as the grading peers are not always sure what is important in the assignment. Add some more examples and explain them directly, I think that would help a lot. :)",4
104236,I loved this course.,5
104237,"Very good and informative course. I liked it mostly because of how it explains the ways one can create the video game world we desire and what must be taken into account. I already had prior knowledge on how to create a video game world that was consistent, but this reinforced what I already knew and took it a bit further. Very recommended for those who are beginners and want to learn how to create a world that feels real and is consistent throughout a game.",4
104238,"I am so glad I found this five course specialization! The teachers are on point. The curriculum compliments the other courses. Thanks to this course, with a little help from the other courses in the specialization, I pushed myself to flesh out a lot of the narrative and design components of my game. Within a month, I have a full fledged story arch, set in a well thought out world that compliments and interacts with the game's narrative, well designed characters, and a balanced and, hopefully, engaging gameplay. Best of all, I've been able to get feedback from other students who have helped point out things I'd missed and suggested ideas. I highly recommend this course, its complimentary courses, and the specialization as a whole!",5
104239,Pretty great course for a total beginner!,5
104240,Incredibly vague and hand wavy. I didn't feel like I had to write anything down.,1
104241,"The course focuses on a number of critical aspects in video game world design, such as artistic direction, spatial and ""physical"" rules, and movement considerations; and it teaches a few methods of planning them. That said, the presentation of these ideas and methods feels less organized than the others in the course. That said, all of them are useful, and if the exercises/submissions don't quite lead up to as organic a whole as the others, it makes up for it by covering bases with varied approaches.",4
104242,The course is very abstract.,2
104243,Great content and great assignments !,5
104244,Very interesting! Thank you!,5
104245,"Good course, but there are not much useful information. It's more analytic",5
104246,Really great course which got me thinking about the game environment a whole lot more than I have ever considered the large impact it has on the successful ability to engage the player and successfully submerge them in the game world. I highly recommend this course to anyone wanting to obtain an insight into games.,5
104247,"A very good experience, but if it could've helped me to find a job it would have been even better.",5
104248,"Compare to Last Course in this Specialization this course lacked the good pace through the assignments, they were out of pace or out of tune, and also there were mostly general talks more than tips to make the student get in to the flow and create a better work, All in All it was Great but compared to the course before it, it had issues :D",4
104249,"The teacher is a litlle abstract. Maybe he would improve himself if he would give more tangible things, as methods.",4
104250,"I learned a lot in this course, it was very helpful. World design is key to defining your game.",5
104251,an awesome course.... each one is being better than the last... fantastic!,5
104252,Amazing course. I learned so much about the game world.,5
104253,Interesting and easily understandable! Thank you!,5
104254,Learnt a lot. Thanks,5
104255,"Easy to follow and well-packed with good information and tips, but I would like to see some kind of quiz-function along the course to test the knowledge I've been learning.",3
104256,I really enjoyed the course.Opened my eyes for many things that I didn't gave much though while design my games.,4
104257,"The course is fun but the content is too general. I like to know more methods and technics to develop a game world, considering genres, mechanics and gameplay options.",3
104258,Fantastic course - doing the assignments forces you to really think about your game world.,5
104259,"The course is ok, but it doesn't give any certificate of completition for free users (something that many other course do give).",3
104260,Great course,5
104261,Useful but as with the first course of the specialization very light on content,3
104262,I wish the course would give me more structured information and examples of applications.,3
104263,"I did not found this course much useful. I expected more detailed examples of worldbuilding, but talks were quite vague and unspecific. ""Sit think about this, go learn about that"".",2
104264,"I had good assignments, but less content than I expected.",4
104265,Realy good one!,5
104266,Excellent course! I studied animation but I didn't know much of the world aspect for game design. This course it's also helpful for animation field.,5
104267,"I was a little bit dissapointed with this course because, in my opinion, it is not structured well, it is just an amount of questions we need to think about. It has ended but I have the feeling I still have no good idea about what is world design for video games...",2
104268,few specifics and examples,2
104269,Very nice course ^^,5
104270,"Short, simplistic. Could be done in a week. Very much a beginner's course for those who have not mindfully observed the game worlds in which they play. The student may come away with a few new ideas and the greatest value is in having peers review the homework assignments. Worth the time, if you quickly breeze through it.",3
104271,Great class! Eye opening.,5
104272,great and informative course :) really enjoyed it,4
104273,It's often not clear the point the professor of this course is trying to make. Instead he often seems to ramble pointing out a 100 little questions that a world designer might ask himself/herself during the process without ever focusing on any. The reader is left not knowing what the key take aways were,1
104274,"Great teacher, great videos, great staff, this course, and CalArts course in general, know how to create great learning content that engages and promotes learning, there is never a second when I'm thinking ""man, when is this going to end?"".",5
104275,"i really like the material, i feel that i learning the basic of video game development",4
104276,I am all for short videos but here it is a little bit too short... Tehchnically there is about 1h of videos for the 4 weeks of this course and no real documentations to review.Hence you get few pointers on how to design game wold for video games and really case studies in my opinion... A full review of one or two games would have been a great addition.,3
104277,"I think that this course is easy to learn and to practice the theory on the assignments, which were given. Thank you very much!",5
104278,"I was unable to complete this course, because the course required at least two years of programming knowledge prior to enrolling. I was confident that I could learn while taking the course, but I continually failed to pass the quizzes in the second of five courses. It was very confusing and the questions were cryptic",2
104279,Very engaging course. Great projects and excellent presentation overall..,5
104280,Interesting!,4
104281,Very good intro to Software Security...,5
104282,This is among the best courses i have taken on Coursera. Thank you so much Prof. Michael Hicks.RegardsAmit,5
104283,"Very good course, interesting material",5
104284,"This course is totally recommended for developers and architects no matter the programming language you use.In my opinion, the only thing that I missed was a project for the penetration testing week.Contents are very well teached and the interviews were awesome.",4
104285,"Learnt a lot. Quite a lot of background required esp. if you've never debugged/analyzed memory locations/ of C programs before. I'm a web developer and write php in my day to day, with a little experience in C++. Being able to read C code wasn't too much of a problem. Very hard, however, was figuring out how to use gdb properly to analyze/ debug -- to calculate the distance between two memory locations, for example. That wasn't something I cared to anguish over.",4
104286,I can make sense very exactly because professor explain the focus of Software Security very well.It's good for me to understand that what is the Software Security.,5
104287,Very good information. Very good course,5
104288,Great course!Learned a lot!,5
104289,Excellent intro course with 3 semi-challenging and fun projects,4
104290,"The course is great but it would be better to have it over 8 weeks to diffuse the amount of valuable information in Week 5. Also, charts should be numbered for easier references in discussions.",4
104291,"very useful , i liked it , the videos short and objective",5
104292,Pretty good and solid information. Looking forward to week2-4 as well.,5
104293,Prof. Hicks delivered one of my favourite Coursera courses. The course was both challenging and very relevant. It had the perfect balance of formal theory and roll-up your sleeves practical assignment.,5
104294,"Personally, even though the recommend time for each week was 2-4 hours. I easily spent 20 hours each week, taking detailed notes on the lectures and following up with the supplemental materials. I absolutely feel that the investment of time was worth it, and even if you only invest the 2-4 recommended hours per week, the $49 course fee is nothing compared to the value of the knowledge that you will gain. I estimate at 2-4 hours/week the course content is worth $800+, and if you follow up with all of the supplemental material, the course is (IMAO) worth $2400+, even in terms of having the unlimited information on the internet organized for you. (I once had to make a decision whether or not to pay $7,000 for Siebel training...)",5
104295,Really solid info about modern state of low level exploitation. Thank you,5
104296,tres bon merci beaucoup,4
104297,good course,5
104298,Great!,5
104299,The course was really helpful and gave me new insights to the things that I have to keep in mind during the development of software. And give me clear insights how to tackle security related aspects during the SDLC.,5
104300,"May be we need to more videos with good examples of the topics covered, I mean good examples that go beyond the basics about topics such as buffer overflow and cross site scripting",3
104301,"Content is really valuable and actionable with a specific comeback for the student in terms of secure development, security and how to understand the origin of exploits and other cyber attacks",5
104302,Great course. Intensive yet informative and extremely critical for any software developer,5
104303,"Finished it in 7 days because it was so interesting. Registered last Thursday, finished today.It was a great course, the first three weeks was the most enjoyable. I personally think week 5 was the most strenuous, but cruised through it nevertheless.Week 3, 4, and 6 were easy.Great course. Would recommend. Sadly, there aren't many courses covering the same topic on a deeper level on the internet.",5
104304,Very good material. I am a software proffesional and there were topics that I really did not know and it is a very good starting point for me.,5
104305,The first three weeks are really interesting. The 4th and 5th are boring: it explains too many arguments in givin just hint to many of them. Many videos are too long and there are too many.In my opinion they should focus on fewer things and explain them in ore details. Many times the lecture becomes just a list.,3
104306,Very interesting and useful course to get involved in the software security.,5
104307,"Week 5 about program analysis and is very interesting and many concepts are new to me. This is also a very well structured course. I had a great time studying it. Thanks, Mike.",5
104308,"Very good course about security, especially if you are looking for details about the low-level of C and C++",5
104309,"A highly recommended course, where Professor Hicks and his coworkers have done a terrific job in assembling and organizing teaching material related to software security, as well as presented it in a very thorough, interesting and comprehensive manner. It fully reached up to my expectations, and I would like to thank & congratulate all the contributors of the course. Well done, everyone!",5
104310,"I found this course very effective, i liked it very much. it provides an overview of all the major topics of Software Security and more important, gives the knowledge and tools to dive deeply into it by yourself using several grate things this course provides: Reading recommendations before each lesson, VM projects and interesting interviews with experts on each field.The homework were challenging enough and covered pretty much all the topics, and the videos were in high quality and well organized.I strongly recommend this course to any Software developer",5
104311,Thank you Sir for the excellent course material. The interviews,5
104312,"It's a very complete course, touching every aspect of software development and engineering from a security perspective. I liked the interviews a lot too, which also show the importance of principles like secure coding and techniques like static analysis, fuzzing and web form sanitizing in the enterprise/corporate world. I totally recommended it.",5
104313,"great introduction, waiting for new techniques like ROP",5
104314,Very good course for strenghtening the basis for a deeper cybersecurity learning.,5
104315,Very nice course!,5
104316,worst course forever,1
104317,"The course consider wide area of themes of Software Security, but not deep. Generally, It's really good course.",5
104318,Very good course. Very good introduction to some interesting concepts in software security. Well explained. Maybe introduce more practical exercises. They could also include references to places where you can practice the concepts learned. For example repositories as vulnhub and others are sites where you can put into practice exercises. It however is a course that is very well explained ...,4
104319,"This course requires you have a good ability of programming about C.You also know some knowledge about the HTML , JavaScript.The course covers a broad range of software security.The hardest part for me is symbolic execution.If your basic knowledge about programming is weak,you need to read materials from Google to understand it.",5
104320,"Excellent course. Good mix of theory & practical. Covers all aspects including vulnerability, detection, prevention, secure coding.",5
104321,"This course can only be taken who have good knowledge in programming.Although there is a assessment quiz at the start of the course It needs to kept in mind that since this course is part of specialization,most people would take it and not all of them are programmers.This course needs a revamp to suit all sorts of security enthusiasts.",2
104322,"Loved the way the material was presented. The homework projects were amazingly insightful, too!",5
104323,Incredible course! Very recommended!,5
104324,A good introduction .course to security covering a lot of topics,5
104325,"The difficulty level of this course is very inconsistent. The first project (stack smashing) was difficult, at least for me, but I could complete it with the information taught in the lectures. I was unable to complete the second project (Badstore.net), which requires a knowledge of html and SQL that is not taught in the course. The third project (fuzzing and symbolic execution) was a joke: ""Type this and tell us what you see."" My advice is if you are a novice, take the free course first to see if you can complete it. Then, if you really need the certificate, pay and retake the course.",2
104326,I thoroughly enjoyed the course.,5
104327,"This course on software security was very informative . This is the best place to start off for a beginner as it not only covers the technical aspects of security ,but also talks about modelling threats and identifying adversaries and their capabilities.I however was slightly disappointed with the testing methods of this course.I feel that most of the testing should have been on the basis of projects and a project should have been included every week .But, all in all taking the course was a very pleasant experience and I thoroughly enjoyed all the projects that were given.Looking forward to taking the next course in the specialization!!",4
104328,Really useful course. I would highly recommend it to any person interested in beginning with Software security. Some SW basic skills are needed to follow the course and take profit of the lessons.,5
104329,"Very informative. A great place to get started understanding buffer overflow attacks, symbolic analysis and concepts related to software security.",5
104330,This course needs too much C/C++ knowledge and the test are far too code oriented. You have to give textual answers without having enough help for memory calculation.,1
104331,Could have gone more deeper in some of the topics which were covered at very high level. Overall a good introduction to the subject matter.,4
104332,"This is a tough course. Tough because I had no experience in C or C++. My background is dot-net and visual basic. It's been study C++ 5 hours a day and take the course 2 hours a day. I made it. The professor is spot on when he says a C++ background is needed. But I made it.If you have the required background you'll find it's a good basis for understanding the multiple vulnerabilities in this code, what they are and how they work. (You better understand stacks and heaps and pointers real well)Worth the time and the effort. Cheers to University if Maryland for making it available and to Professor Hicks for his hard work.",4
104333,"Some parts of the course were more advanced (Program Analysis), while some briefly touched the topic (Penetration Testing). Web Application Security was almost there, while Low Level Security was just right!Keep up the good work, recommended +++++",4
104334,There should me more topics on secure code review methods,3
104335,The first half of the course was great but 2nd half was a bit disappointing.,3
104336,A great primer for the field of software security!,5
104337,"Excelent work thanks for all the information, you should give more practice in the fields or put more links to labs so we keep practicing",5
104338,2nd Last week should actually be the last week's content. It seemed out of context and involved so many new things,5
104339,"Very good course. Does require a significant amount of commitment, I would put it at 10-12 hours per week if you're to do things properly. I think if you give it a lot you'll get a lot from it in return. It's very interesting and engaging with clear explanations throughout.",5
104340,"Awesome! It would have been nicer to go deeper into the practical, pen testing part, but I enjoyed this course anyway.",4
104341,Great course!,5
104342,The project is very helpful to understand the course material,5
104343,Its just a perfect course for any beginners....thank u sooo much coursera...!!,5
104344,Very good course!,5
104345,"Great course, but not reasonable amount of time between quizzes attempts.49 Days is too long time to wait if you fail in the quiz.",5
104346,It is what I was looking for!,5
104347,this course cover every thing in Software Security and make my knowledge different .,5
104348,"The course of this kind was extremely needed, still in it's current state it contains lots of inaccuracies in lectures and quizes. I hope they will be fixed up to the future sessions.",5
104349,Thank you very much! This course is so useful to me!,5
104350,"Well structured and complete overview on a very exciting topic make this MOOC really enjoyable and interesting to attend. The speakers are of high quality, coming from all the types of activity involved in start up ecosystem (even though quite all HEC or X graduates :)) and with very clear speeches.I highly recommend.",5
104351,"Excellent content undermined by technical problems. The non-multiple-choice assignment (which involves analyzing a business plan) is particularly annoying. It requires uploading of screenshots but there is no ""upload"" feature is available. The assignment must be graded by ""peers"" -- which means, if you happen to take this course at a time when no one else is taking it, you're out of luck.Re: content, I would discourage you from taking this course if you don't speak fluent French. Indeed, you even need to understand how the French sometimes mis-translate into English, because some words in the answers to the multiple-choice quizzes don't exist in any English dictionary -- you will only understand them if you can guess what French term inspired the bad translation. The pace of lecture-hall-style discourse in the videos is such that subtitles will not save you if you don't understand French.These technical and minor content issues are unfortunate, because the core content i s really quite good.",3
104352,Great course,5
104353,Awesome! If you are a singer songwriter you need this knowledge!,5
104354,Pat Pattison is such a great teacher and the way he shares knowledge is fantastic. I really enjoyed learning about songwriting and laughing at Pat's jokes. I hope he offers another class on the subject.,5
104355,Opened up everything for me. Never wrote before and now I write many times a day.,5
104356,"I've learned here, what I have not learned in 4 years of college: discipline.",5
104357,so helpful.,5
104358,I would strongly recommend this course to anyone wanting to learn songwriting techniques. Pat Pattison is great and makes learning fun! I feel I have learned so much in such a short time. Loved every minute of it and I hope some day to be able to take other courses with Pat!,5
104359,join us to learn from the beginning!,5
104360,Maybe start a course ab,5
104361,Completely awesome,5
104362,"I am impressed at how there is theory and study behind the art of writing songs. The course opened my eyes to this vast and interesting subject.Pat Pattson is a fantastic teacher with incredible didactics, knowledge and personality. I just have to thank you.",5
104363,Pat presents with a great demeanour and covers a lot of ground in this course.I'm definitely a better songwriter for it. This includes the secret to removing writer's block.,5
104364,Pat Pattison for President.,5
104365,Brilliant!,5
104366,"Fantastic course, lecturer and feed back!",5
104367,Amazing and powerful tools to craft my songs. Immediate implementation to solidify my learning. Peer reviews gave me a sense of community during the course.,5
104368,"A great course, learned a lot but due to not being in a position to purchase the certificate OI could not submit quizzes or assignments, such a shame as I could not get feedback",4
104369,"Very very educated course for songwriting, totaly recommended!",5
104370,"This course was so much better than I thought it would be. Pat Pattison illuminated a level of craftsmanship within songwriting that I didn't realize existed, and I loved every new technique and discovery. He takes you through the process step-by-step, and you practice in bits and pieces along the way, so that by the time you are called on to write a complete song at the end, you feel prepared and excited. I learned a lot about writing, but I also learned a lot about the art of teaching writing. I highly recommend this course. It's so, so good. So good.",5
104371,"Great course. Just what I needed as a beginner in writing lyrics. I've been singing/playing/producing, but never really try to write lyrics. This course opens up the subject and gives you the opportunity to understand that writing lyrics is a craft.",5
104372,"Very interesting, unusual and emotional course.",5
104373,Just what I needed!,5
104374,"Was completely surprised by this course. There is so much information presented in a clear, understandable, and intriguing way. I was engaged the whole time. This class has been the catalyst I've needed for awhile to inspire me to pick up my guitar daily and make progress on ideas. Its so great to have a dependable structure to work with as opposed to hoping inspiration is enough to get me something good. I am so thankful this course exists and it so accessible. Highly recommend!",5
104375,This is how you write songs...... Awesome!!!!!,5
104376,A bit disorganized and rambling lectures. Good content,3
104377,Feeling Inspired!!,5
104378,"Excellent course. I have been writing songs for years, some of which might be considered good. However, I always knew I didn't really know how to write songs as a craft. That's why I took this course. The course has now provided me with the toolbox to begin approaching songwriting as it really is, a craft based on skills one learns and develops. I very much would like to take a another course with Pat Pattison, because this one was huge fun! Thanks Pat, Thanks Berklee, Thanks Coursera.",5
104379,"The course material and the instructor's lectures are excellent. However the quizzes are programmed incorrectly--marking wrong answers right and right answers wrong too often.I gained a few skills that I now put to use when writing songs. The course also provided some insightful information on prosody, phrasing, and a little bit of history. It was definitely worth the time I invested in doing this course.",4
104380,If i could give this course more than 5 stars I would. It has revolutionized my approach to writing lyrics and given me tools and techniques that really blow my mind. Definitely recommend!,5
104381,I've been writing instrumental music for about 5 years now but could never put lyrics to my work. This course is proving to be really helpful and has provided lots of techniques and tools that are incredibly useful. On top of that I have to praise the instructor Pat Pattison. He has a lot of charisma and makes these lessons really fun - I've had to pause the videos a few times now just to laugh at his witticism.,5
104382,"This course opened my eyes to a number of concepts which seem blatantly obvious now that I know them, but which I had never considered before taking the course. The reasons I couldn't quite put my finger on as to why certain lyrics of mine seemed off. Highly recommended!",5
104383,"This course provides excellent tools for idea development, considering elements like points of view, stability/instability and rhyme.",5
104384,"I thought the lessons were really boring, there are some interesting aspects about it, but it's hard to concentrate, Pat Pattinson couldn't get me hooked up all the time.",2
104385,"This course is amazing and offers you a lot of tools for vocal production, and Prince Charles Alexander is a great teacher!. My only suggestion will be to have a different final assignment. It was surprising to me that the final assignment was to do an essay, since the clases were pretty much all about applying the tools in your DAW, I really thought we were going to summit an audio vocal recording using some of the tools we learned during the course. But overall was great, thank you so much for bringing this to us!",5
104386,"Maybe if you're just starting out and using the same software as Prince Charles, this class would be more useful. Even so, the audio on this has got to be fixed, especially since this is an audio class about mixing!I learned a few vocal layering techniques, but this is a really beginner class and is very DAW-specific; if you aren't using the specific software, the information here will only be valuable for topical concepts. Because if this, watching the videos aren't much help visually, but then it's an uneasy listen because the audio levels in the videos are so uneven, that you can barely hear the professor's voice on a common speaker, and then you get BLASTED when he turns on an audio clip.The way he explained things also felt a bit slow and dragging to me. I teach young children, and it seemed reminiscent of the way I have to talk to them sometimes. Then there's this really awkward and long interview with his musical colleague (week 4) who didn't seem to know much about what he was being asked, and while watching their conversation, it's totally apparent in the professor's face that he wasn't getting the output he wanted from the guy.Thanks for the vocal techniques. I hope this feedback is helpful.",3
104387,Just Great :),5
104388,"I audited this course. Had I been more serious on the music side, I would have done the specialization or completion certificate. The videos were great breakdowns of effects common to most DAWs. The walk through of using the effects made me more comfortable with exploring different settings other than what is in the defaults.",5
104389,"Unnecessary extra videos, that could and should be joined together. In particular, in lessons 2 and 3 all ""topic introductions"" could be joined with the following ""let's discuss this topic inside a DAW"" video.Awful dynamic range. In some videos voice of lector is very quiet (-20 dB or less) and sound played from the DAW is much louder (around -6 dB). In other videos, the opposite: loud lector and quiet DAW. Change of microphone setup between intro video and ""in the DAW"" video is also very noticeable and distracting.Repeats of repeats over repeats. This is not needed at all. I could repeat everything by myself, just pause video and replay interesting fragment. I don't need to be reminded how a single background vocal sounds or that we need to change panning each time we add new track. Yes, It should be done from time to time, but not each time. These repeats make the lessons unnecessary long, it feels I could have been told the same information in half of time or less.This combines with very slow pace of a lector. I listened all lessons on 1.5 or even 2.0 tempo, just to not fall asleep.Quizzes are strange. Stupid quesion appeared in quiz three: which key combinations we use in the videos? But why do you ever ask this, how this relates to the topic? I use another DAW in another OS, I even don't have a ""command"" key, I could have changed my hot keys, so your particular hot key setup is not any significance for me. I was expected to be quizzed for which parameters to tune, how it sounds and alike, not this particular crap. Trust me, anyone could figure which hot keys to use. I am not just a monkey, I have an ability to explore my software by myself, I don't need to be told how to copy and paste, and even if I need this I just go look in the manual.",1
104390,I cannot step toward without testify my gratefulness to Coursera and most specially to Prince Alexander for the outstanding job in teaching this class! This Vocal Production teaching class puts me in higher level in my performance at church!Thank you,5
104391,Thank you very much for this amazing course.,5

104393,Loved and enjoyed this course and gained more experience. Thank you!!!!!,5
104394,"I liked your course. It is very thorough, but the stories and acting parts get a bit cheesy. I would have appreciated a course more finely tuned to serious learners. It seems geared towards high schoolers.",4
104395,"Wonderful videos and instruction as usual. Teach English is the best produced online course that I have ever taken. Fun, engaging and sticky :)",5

104409,"It was a great learning experience, especially to know about different reading and writing activities which I knew nothing about. This module will definitely help me become a better teacher.",5
104410,Very useful! Learned a bunch and was able to apply it in my teaching right away. Highly recommend,5
104411,"This has given me a lot of ideas on how to handle the reading, writing, and grammar parts of ESL lessons. Kudos to all the ASU professors who made this series a huge success!",5
104412,a great course,5
104413,Thank you it's a great experience,5
104414,It was an amazing experience. I learned skills that I can apply teaching other courses as well.,5

104432,The course was Very helpful for my job as an english teacher!,5
104433,"I really enjoyed this course ! It was well-organized and very creative to explain the ""reading, writing and grammar"" of the English language.",5
104434,Exellent! As always with Shane Dixon and his collegues! Imposible to improve!,5
104435,"Great, I just didn't like editing old stuff - I'd have preferred them asking for separate writing and reading lessons.",4
104436,Great and very useful course and knowledge that you get you can really apply in classroom.,5
104437,"Is a great Course with excellent teachers and a great approach for everyone, using all the types of learning for all the types of learners.",4

104440,"Great course! We may overlook such skills for our students, but they're indeed necessary! I highly recommend it!",5
104441,"This course was very enjoyable. Like the previous courses, the videos make learning easier than reading from a textbook and much more enjoyable.",5
104442,Great course! Great presentation of the material!,5
104443,"So far taking the trail run before the lessons begin, I have learnt so much and its easy to follow a long and understand. Your lessons are extremely creative as well.Thank you for making it easy :)",5
104444,"As it was always, great experience and pleasure to learn.",5
104445,"As usual, the team of the Teach English Now! managed to squeeze a few years of university into one course - dense, but easily digestible. Lots of fun guaranteed.",5
104446,"The Course was really encouraging and a great fun. Many thanks to the creators of the course - Dr. Shane Dixon, Dr. Justin Shewell and Jessica Cinco. Your efforts were not vain. You are great educators!!!",5
104447,I like this course as it gives me opportunity to refresh my knowledge.,5
104448,I loved the way our instructors made the lectures more sticky by incorporating them in children stories!,5
104449,"Highly Effective, Informative, and Beautifully Delivered Course!Want to know how to efficiently teach Reading, Writing, and Grammar (the painful one:)?

104454,enjoying the learning process. great piece.,5
104455,Great course. Interesting ideas and methods to make students be involved. I really liked the course.,5

Teachers able to inspire are not found everywhere. But they are here!Despite to have studied in some of the best institutions of two countries, I never found professors like here as Shane Dixon and Jessica Cinco. Congratulations! More than teach, you inspire!",5
104457,"Highly recommend this course to anyone who is new to the field, wants a refresher, or just needs a bit more professionalization in the work. Top Notch, as is to be expected from the folks at ASU Teach English Now!",5
104458,"What a creative idea by filming our courses as the fairy story ""the wizard of oz"", I had a lot of fun so far.",5
104459,"Great course and loved hearing not only the subjective experience from people of what they were taught, but also brought things to the table to discuss on rational level without hostility as well as finding some objective truths in this discourse and lessons in the class.",5
104460,Fascinating!!!,5
104461,"This course breaks all the taboos with academics discussing the history of how humans developed their belief systems, how religions and societies engineer how humans define themselves and how humans view themselves and their concepts of their soul beliefs... My favorite course of all time...",5
104462,Really enjoying this course. Fascinating!,5
104463,"Really liked the funny, old professor who gives most of the lectures. Good info.",4
104464,"Great course, also very good example for interdisciplinary communication to solve some of the riddleswe call existence/life",5
104465,"This is a truly unique course, covering an essential but largely neglected part of human nature and history.",5
104466,"Excellent course, taught by absolutely amazing and intellectually stimulating professors.",5
104467,"I love this course, however, I really wish it would have covered other types of belief systems as well, such as the native american beliefs, ancient celtic, or ancient norse belief systems, which have some similarities to the old middle eastern religions, but also a lot of differences.",5
104468,"I found the lectures and reading material very interesting. The professors were very good at explaining complex material and it served to tie together some loose ends regarding various religions that I had been struggling with. As a retiree, I was not interested in receiving a certificate so I didn't take the tests or do the peer reviews though. I was only interested in hearing the lectures.",5
104469,This is an eye opening course. However I'm not willing to give up my belief in my Catholic faith.,5
104470,A introduction into the history of beliefs. It was kind of frustrating the way Buddhism was covered.,5
104471,"Excelent, a deep view about the origin of religions and the things they share",5
104472,"I just love this course. It is funny, easy to follow and really interesting.",5
104473,"Covered a broad range of religious beliefs about the afterlife. Solid overview of Darwin and evolution as well as good videos e.g. Dawkins, Hitchens, Harris. The videos of actual classroom delivery with students provided a realism to the online experience. Both profs. were excellent teachers with the necessary skills to handle sensitive topics.The course could be improved by more clearly written assignments. The content of these assignments was appropriate but the word structure was too vague and in some cases disjointed.Excellent course. Well done Rutgers.",4
104474,"Essential course for every student , thinker and even human being,",5
104475,"This is a course for those who have not spent any time delving into comparative religion and testing their own traditional (family taught) belief systems with thoughts of act versus ""trut.""",3
104476,not bad but not excellent,3
104477,If you are fascinated by different belief systems this course is for you.,5
104478,"This course is the most interesting course I've done. It has so many facets and different topics, yet a clear line of thought. The lectures are interesting and the assignments helpful. I would recommend this to everyone... who is ready for his/her ideas and beliefs to be shaken up !",5
104479,I found it really amazing... i wish i could have been present in the classroom :),5
104480,"The course offers a very interesting insight into soul beliefs and combines history, psychology and philosophy. The articulate lecturers and a well prepared material help to maintain the interest and understand the content.",5
104481,This is a great course. Profs have an interesting way of getting info to us.,5
104482,"The course starts by having students identify what they were taught to believe and walks the student through the human concept of soul belief. It takes you on a journey of religious progression and rationalizes mind and body experience. Thanks so much Corrsera, Ruthers, Professors Daniel Ogilvie and Leonard Hamilton, and all the great guest speakers for such an outstanding course.",5
104483,The course was choppy,1
104484,"very nice course, except for the name. causes is ok, but consequences doesnt receive the importante that the title implies.",5
104485,a thought provoking course .. the prof. has an amusing personality which makes it easy to go through the lecture,5
104486,Very Informative and logical. Loved Prof. Daniel Ogilvie lectures,4
104487,A life changing course.,5
104488,This course gives a great view point of the evolution of different religions.It also dwells into how we have today managed to successfully misinterpret the core values of religion leading to mass wold unrest.Its a course that gives us a better understanding into how our beliefs have come to be as we know it today by tracing back history and the philosophers who contributed towards religious beliefs.,5
104489,"This is a high-quality, thought-provoking course.",5
104490,"Wonderful course, very interesting and thought provoking.",5
104491,Very interesting and rare class!,4
104492,It's format needs a good narrator not based on stupid commercials.,1
104493,I think it is a very interesting course. And one can feel the passion that the teachers have in doing it.Thank you,5
104494,I enjoyed the course. It gave a good historical look at the foundations of religion. I'm looking forward to Unit 2.,4
104495,"The course was really interesting. Professors are so adorable and the material are full of new thoughts and knowledge. I hope I can take the second and the third units of the course. With great respect, grateful to the creators of the course. Thank you!",5
104496,"A thought provoking course, well done, interesting, and enlightening.",5
104497,Great class and wonderful teacher. He explained the lessons so well,5
104498,Extremely boring teacher,1
104499,High on opinion and low on scholarship.,1
104500,"Interesting, different and fun.",5
104501,"The false comparison between religion and soul beliefs cloud the validity of the course. Maybe the intent was to only show the worst case ""Soul Beliefs"" then shoot them down. However, at least to me, the instructor seemed to extrapolate ""some beliefs"" to ""all beliefs"".",1
104502,Amazing course touching areas where I also often debated with myself.,4
104503,I sincerely appreciate the enormous effort and encouragement of Prof. Daniel M. Ogilvie and Prof. Leonard W. Hamilton. A sincere hug and my gratitude.,4
104504,"I really enjoyed this course. An interesting mix of history, philosophy and psychology. I enjoyed the written assignments as it made me think harder about the course material than just passing the quizzes. Reviewing others' work was fascinating too, as it made me consider things from different points of view (though I do think the reviewing criteria would've benefitted from being just a little bit more detailed, to better reflect the huge variation in standard between submissions).I'm very much looking forward to the next module!",5
104505,"Very good, thanks",5
104506,"Thank you for the opportunity to have a better life through many understandings found in the Rutgers State University course Soul Beliefs: Causes and Consequences. The information was refreshing, enlightening and cut to the quick on many questions I had about soul beliefs.",5
104507,The course gives a lot of interesting information in a entertain way of learning.,5
104508,"A new course with new material. The course is in the beginning stages of evolution, just like the human psyche. Perhaps someone will refine it in time but it is a very good course, especially considering nothing quite like this has been presented before.",4
104509,"My first choice and completed course here, two additional courses on soul beliefs follow and I will certainly be doing those as well. I found the material (both lectures and reading references) very interesting and it connected to daily life and many conversations I find myself referencing things that are discussed here. Retired professor, Daniel Ogilvie, is the primary lecturer and he's very easy to listen to. He has a good personality and gets you thinking. Because of the nature of soul and afterlife beliefs is a personal topic (controversial as well) he and the other lecturers I found to be very passionate and thoughtful in their presentations. I especially enjoyed the writing assignments and learned not only from writing my own submissions but also doing peer reviews.This is truly a one of a kind course in that you would be hard pressed to find one book or class that is inclusive of many different sources of soul and afterlife beliefs covered collectively. His own writing is one of the reading references (as an overview) specifically because you won't find it all under one roof elsewhere. The course discusses mythology, philosophy, many religions as well as atheism, psychology and neuroscience... some might consider the religious segments taboo or unsettling. Hopefully if you are considering this course you are an open-minded individual. I chose this course to work on for the purpose of personal enrichment and it has sparked motivation for me to continue auditing courses after not having formally studied in over 20 years. It was a challenge but well worth it!",5
104510,The most interesting class I've ever taken. The material covers everything from psychology to sociology and then adds more.,5
104511,well taught but not what I thought it would be.,1
104512,The course aroused my intellectual interest to its highest.Thanks.,5
104513,"So interesting, getting religion discussions with differents perspectives and the teachers are amazing !",5
104514,A very interesting course.,4
104515,"Summary:Unit 1 is comprehensive in covering historical foundations of after-life beliefs, from pre-history to modern times. This is a necessary grounding to understand the evolution of religion. It provides different religious perspectives on the issue, and Prof Hamilton brings about an objective view in exploring the topic.Perhaps the important thing for students to better appreciate the course is that it is titled Soul ""Beliefs"". These are beliefs from different religions, not facts. It is necessary to keep that in mind. Understanding that will lead to a more unbiased and scientific approach towards the topic.Context:I came across this course after recently losing my fiancée. Am going through Unit 2 at the moment.I grew up in a Buddhist environment for over 20 years before distancing myself over the last several years. I appreciate the philosophies of Buddhism and that of other religions, but I would describe myself to be agnostic. My recent experiences and subsequent studies of history, philosophy, neuroscience and psychiatry and various interactions with different religious leaders have only reinforced this perspective. This course has been very helpful in providing unbiased information on the topic of after-life beliefs.",5
104516,"Fascinating, informative, thought provoking, makes you think. What more could you ask for from a Course? The Professors are wonderful. I'm so glad I choose to take this Course.",5
104517,"I enrolled in this course hoping to find a balanced perspective about historical foundations for religions and other philosophies. It did include a good amount of interesting material around different systems, but there were a couple of key things that made me lose interest in the course at around week 6 out of 11.First, I felt that the instructor talks about how he wants people to learn to think for themselves, yet I also felt that he himself preaches. Much of the evidence in his lectures is delivered as an anecdote, which might appeal to some (e.g. I could see that happening to me) and probably made the course more entertaining, but didn't do it for me. I felt that the Wade reading, in contrast, was balanced, cited other sources, and pulled in a variety of perspectives, but when I listened to the lectures, I felt that Professor Ogilvie had a tendency to state points and expect people to believe them.Second, on a related note -- this course was not shaped for the online medium. I understand that it's cheaper and easier for universities to just use recordings of live lectures, but that meant that the lectures contained quite a bit of anecdotal rambling (e.g. going off on a tangent on how you should never take charge of somebody else's soul). Another, smaller beef I have with the presentation of the course is that when he had students who were raised under different religions come up and speak their beliefs, it took a long time to demonstrate a fairly simple idea -- despite people ascribing to the same ""label,"" the same religion, they can have in fact been taught very different things. In a live university class, having students speak can work because the evidence is being presented by ""one of you"" (""you"" being the students), and has the added benefit of building community in the class. But in an online class, I didn't feel that kinship at all.I'll make a disclaimer that much of this review is about how I personally felt about the course, and about how it wasn't right for me. Some of what I didn't like, others may like. But overall, despite being initially interested in the topic and why people believe what they do, I didn't feel that the material was delivered in a way that captured my continued interest.",2
104518,"I loved the beginning of the course and the information about Darwin. I may agree with Dawson, but I find him too darn smug. I once watched a documentary about intelligent design, Another scientist told him how lucky he was to have such fame, wealth, and good health, He asked him if he died and found a God,what would he think? Dawson's answer was and I'm not exactly quoting but he",4
104519,Must see for everyone who wants to understand religion much better from scientific point of view.,5
104520,I just started with this course and I am loving it! This not only offers a very fresh perspective on beliefs about souls and an afterlife but is also extremely relatable on a personal level.,5
104521,Opening the mind to new ways of thinking about Rel,5
104522,I´m really enjoying it! and I think is very important and trascendental for our societies to start developing this kind of courses based on reflecting about the religion.,5
104523,everybody have to do it,5
104524,"I loved the presentation of this course, as someone interested in what distinguishes us from other animals and the mechanisms that underlie our senses of self. Some of the material, I was already familiar with because of other books on anthropology and evolution, but appreciated nevertheless how it was related to the beliefs in the soul and our psychological survival.",5
104525,Its an eye opener,5
104526,"I must confess I've tried to complete other courses before but due to time constraints and other responsibilities I've failed miserably. But this time thanks to the fact I can study this on my own pace, I'm no longer having a clash between my job and the courses I want to study, which in turn fills me with excitement and appreciation for this course. Personally, I have a deep interest in the field of religion (spirituality, theology, comparative religions, etc) which I think it is fascinating. That's why I decided to enroll in this course and give it my best. I'm learning so much thanks to the awesome lectures the professors are given and the material it is provided. I watch the lectures, I take tons of notes and I do some extra research as well. I'm just about to finish unit 1 and looking forward to starting unit 2.I want to thank Coursera from the bottom of my heart for making this course available for free so I can have access to this material. The knowledge I'm getting here is helping me to sharpen my focus on what to study next.I hope more courses on religion (from an academic perspective) are offered in the future so I can learn even more. (I saw a course on Calvinism I'm already interested in but it's not available yet).My name is George (Jorge in Spanish) and I'm from South America, Chile.Thank you to all of you for your efforts. They are deeply appreciated.",5
104527,I learned a lot!,5
104528,"This was the most challenging of the five courses as there are quite a few statistical principles to grasp along with some fairly lengthy equations for a non-maths type like me. Enjoyed the course and the content along with its delivery. If there is one thing I would suggest is that there was too much repetitive spreadsheet work in the assignments which became a little tedious. Overall, a very good course.",4
104529,"It teach us how to run calculation in excel. It does not teach how to do calculations to decide a specific SAA, how to pic stocks, how to make decisions in real life.",3
104530,"Great course! This course will give you a preparation of real-life investment planning for clients. If you have a chance, don't missed it.",5
104531,Wonderfully designed course!,5
104532,Excellent! Well design project for the end of Specialization.,5
104533,Great capstone with practical application of concepts learned I the prior 4 courses. I would love to have a part 2 with more advanced concepts.,5
104534,"Practical Problems were so well organized, it was rather fun working out the solutions.. It was superb experience.",5
104535,Very instructive and practical Capstone project in the continuity of the 4 previous modules. Many thanks to the UNIGE for this great specialization.,5
104536,"This course is awesome. Seriously! I'm not Jewish. I have been studying the Torah with a Jewish friend, and I am learning Hebrew. This course went beyond expectations in providing a frame of reference for understanding not only what the Talmud is, but understanding that it is accessible to any who study it! Grateful to the presenters for their energy and presence.",5
104537,Best course I've experienced on Coursera so far! Really engaging and not 'dumbed down'. Fantastic and charismatic professor and assistant. Already recommended the course to many friends.,5
104538,This course is both a traditional and non-traditional Talmud course. The non-traditional gives a historic prospective of the basis of Talmud with a modern view of its derivation.,5
104539,Entertaining way of teaching a complex subject,4
104540,"In MOOC, I have been taking course regarding 'Israel', even though, I did not think to find something as special as it is. The Talmud: For give a clear review, It will take me long time to express certainly its deepest way",5
104541,Ya'sher Koach!!!!,5
104542,"very interesting, challenging, but I find it hard to understand the intonation (highs and lows) of the ph",4
104543,"An outstanding look into the complexities and nuances of the the Talmud. Well-taught, thought-provoking, interesting...",5
104544,Nice course. I had no understanding of this part of Judism at all and the course really helped me.,5
104545,Very disappointed at the lack of notes and course material. I hope part 5/5 improves.,1
104546,Very clear and understandable.,5
104547,It is interesting.,4
104548,it was really informative and helpful for those who wants to grow in their career.,5
104549,Great course...,5
104550,Great course!,5
104551,Great Course. I learned a lot about supplier's classification.,5
104552,Easy and fun..,5
104553,It's not worth the price.,1
104554,Great course. Matthew Yee King is a fantastic instructor and I am learning a lot about what seems to be a really exciting framework!,5
104555,"Great course! It covers many aspects of web development and it is really helpful that you can see a complex application being created line by line. The only issue that kept me from giving 5 stars is the assignments. Frankly, they are too simple! They don't give you the chance to repeat the techniques shown in the videos and comprehend these complex and for some of us new topics. Many thanks!",4
104556,Fantastic course! I think there is no simpler way to learn meteor and mongo rather than the way it is in this course. Many thanks for such a great course!,5
104557,"The previous 3 courses was pretty good, but the assignment is tooooooooo easy, and this course has lot of redundancy, which i think it is not necessary, but overall, i think it is good",3
104558,A great introduction to the real capacities of meteor.,5
104559,Awsome !,5
104560,Another lovely course from Dr. Matthew Yee King. A gifted instructor indeed.,5
104561,"Very good introduction to Meteor. Should be updated to newer Meteor version, lots of things have changed in the official guidelines in the meantime.",4
104562,Very promising environment.,5
104563,I feel this course offered me a solid foundation that helps me manipulate JS and JQuery-based scripts on a daily basis.,5
104564,"Course is good, the reason I'm giving it a low rating is because it's a little redundant with course 3 ""Introduction to Meteor.js Development"". Some of the features covered in this course I researched on my own to create the final development project in Course 3. So no much value for me here.",2
104565,thank you,5
104566,"Very nice course. Although some of it's concepts can be applied in other technologies, it's main focus is on MeteorJS framework.",5
104567,"The course is excellent: modern, practical, and with a number of useful tips.",5
104568,"This is really quite an advanced course that quickly takes you into making a functional, collaborative app. Very well taught despite the quite quick pace!",5
104569,"This was informative, but there were some issues with the final project that could have used some more guidance.",4
104570,Excellent course. Very good instructor.,5
104571,"Nice course, a lot of new powerful things.",5
104572,"Excellent clarifying, a lot of concepts are really clear after this course.",5
104573,"The final project for this one was difficult but within reason, as it should be.",4
104574,Excellent course with challenging projects. Teaches essential techniques for MongoDB.,5
104575,Strongly Recommended,5
104576,Awesome content!,5
104577,"It was challenging, but videos (and lecturer) are very easy-to-follow :)",5
104578,The professor is super nice and the course is very helpful,5
104579,Outdated course that needs a lot of changes to your code and in releases so you can follow professors code.A lot of people had same issues.,1
104580,I love the course format,5
104581,"I would prefer if the course lasted 6 weeks so we can get a better understanding in theory and practice every single bit of the code. It was a nice ride in general and I liked it. The last exercise was hard, it could have been a little easier.",3
104582,Great course!!!! I love MeteorJS,5
104583,Great course! I had a wonderful time during the course,5
104584,"The teacher is very comprehensive and very serious. I saw the power of Meter while I was staring to learnNode.js, thanks.",5
104585,Sensacional. Everytime I saw all videos in the same day (yesterday) ... great teatcher and good material. Best course ever.,5
104586,Amazing course! Dr. Yee-King is an amazing instructor and really makes the information accessible.,5
104587,Really usefull,5
104588,Excellent course! It helps to obtain good basis of MongoDB,5
104589,"Very good lecture, which make beginner to make application following through it.",5
104590,Simply Good!,5
104591,clear explanation and practical project,5
104592,"WOW!!! Raised the bar compared to the previous courses, final project took some effort...fast paced but worth the time",5
104593,Great course and I learned alot. Love the teaching methods.,5
104594,"Only one assignment at the end, so you go through 3 weeks before being asked to code (this seems like a big mistake for any programming course). The final assignment gives you a largely complete project and just asks you to make a few changes. You can't put that as a project on a resume, because you're doing 5% of the work with your hand held through it.Worst of all, the code given to you does not adhere to JavaScript best practices, like local variables not being declared (so that they become global variables, a big no-no), spacing being all over the place, etc. JavaScript has a bad reputation, and sloppy teaching with respect to best practices is very bad.",2
104595,"Great course!When developing the assignments for this and previous courses, I had learned a lot of new. Then I read Meteor Guide, and catched myself on the thought that many of recommendations described in Meteor Giude I had already leant on my own experience. It's really great. Thanks a lot to Mattnew for his excellent lectures and very useful examples and starter applications.And yes, love the final assignment very much. It's absolutely great and powerful.",5
104596,"The videos are really good, makes it fun to watch and learn. I especially like that it's appearently iive coded and you get to know the train of thoughts from the Lecturer.Really well done, thanks for this course :)",5
104597,Great course!! It's really useful.,4
104598,Great course!,5
104599,Great into course,5
104600,"I really liked the course. Tha manner of teaching and the subject with all the details of ""how to"" are attention catchy. Unfortunately just had no time to complete it properly and in time.",5
104601,Amazing course! Very good material and didactics. Hope there are more meteor courses with him!,5
104602,"Really nice step forward from the basic Meteor course. I love the way the teacher explains the concepts, and how he builds meaningful examples",5
104603,Matthew is a great instructor. Loved the way how he taught the entire series especially this one. Step by Step explaining every little detail. Keep up the good work...,5
104604,"Really great course. The education was practical showing real life process of creating pages, not boring theory.",5
104605,"Excellent coursera and nice instructor, keep it up good work.....",5
104606,Awesome course!,5
104607,Meteor is pretty cool you need to see this course!,5
104608,"I am learning a new thing on my every step, very efficient way to learn things.",5
104609,"This course was a great tool towards a deeper understanding of more advanced aspects of the Meteor environment. I have learned a lot and enjoyed the way content is exposed in a natural and gradual way, building understanding one step after the other.Great course to those interested in a great and promising framework!",5
104610,This course was too repetitive compare to the previous course in the specialization.,2
104611,This specialization really grows on you :P,5
104612,"Nice, thank you very much :)",5
104613,"Review of documentation from meteorjs website.Slow and boring course.Last assignment is where something starts to be moving but that's the end of course :(You could dive deep into Subscribe/Publish, what is below meteor(node.js) etc.",2
104614,One of the best,5
104615,Very Nice teaching. Why don't you people try to make new Tutorials for Nodejs. That would be awesome.Really enjoying learning Meteor.,5
104616,"Repetitive content, like the latter course, not challenging",1
104617,"Great course, special I liked the test challenge",5
104618,"Thaks for a well tougth course, simplicity in this kind of topics is hard and here is done in masterful way.",5
104619,"Yet another great contribution to the specialization with a focus on mechanics behind reactivity and security of applications. This, in fact means, that the module is quite unfortunately named. So far it was the hardest module, mainly because it mainly deal with back-end of the Meteor, but after completing the assignment, many aspects of real-time secure manipulation of the mongoDB become more clear.",5
104620,"Best course in the specialization so far. Well thought out and explained. The course still has the same problem with quiz questions being at times obtuse, but overall it's a really good course.",4
104621,"Great course, I feel ready to develop some apps now.",5
104622,Great cours !,4
104623,great course about meteor.js applications,5
104624,Great Course,4
104625,The best professor to learn coding from !,5
104626,"A phenomenal class, it is just detailed enough to give what's needed to build fully functional Mongo-supported websites on ones own.",5
104627,"Well done, I learned a lot from this course.",5
104628,"Enjoying it, but missed out a bit before...",4
104629,The best starting course for meteor! well done and thanks!,5
104630,Dr. Matthew Yee-King is one of the best teachers I ever seen. Besides course is really interesting and useful.,5
104631,Very interesting issue masterly explained.,5
104632,Perfect,5
104633,Pretty well,5
104634,Course was a fulfilling refresher course. Presentation was direct and easy to comprehend course material. Only downfall is the lack of a course forum for participates to communicate with others to get further instruction in areas of need.,4
104635,"Excellent teachers, very informative. Overall a positive learning experience.",5
104636,The course is not free but qualitative and quantitative.,4
104637,Very good course. Lots of materials to study and the practice exercises are well designed and require good thinking. I learned the basics to continue studying calculus in a more advanced level.,5
104638,Great course,5
104639,A nice effort. good if more interactive lessons,4
104640,Very useful course. I was able to use both The Trig and Functions courses to brush up on my math for my college assessment exams. That allowed me to skip all of the remedial courses that I would have been otherwise required to take.,5
104641,Very clear and concise lessons. I learned so much. But I wish there were lessons for graphing trigonometric functions.,4
104642,"Awesome course!Great videos showing clear and easy to understand examples on the material. I love that the quizzes required me to pay attention to details. That threw me off a couple of times, and I was baffled that I got some of the answers wrong, but it's a very good way to learn to take an extra moment to read and understand the questions, which I believe is an important part of learning to do things right. This course also has a link to a brilliant Pre-Calculus reference guide.Thank you for your teaching PhD Ladies - I think I will take your PC: Functions course now. :-)",5
104643,Thx a lot!),5
104644,"This course is very good!!! My only complaint is that this course only has a ""reading option"" with a handful of short videos. The short videos are EXTREMELY helpful because I learn from both hearing and seeing. Thus, I learn best when I see the problem being worked out.It is 10x more helpful to me when I SEE the problem being worked out AS WELL AS HEAR them explaining the process. I watched the videos over and over again to grasp and excel in the concept. However, with two hours of just plain reading assigned... I found it harder to grasp. It didn't show the problem being worked out... although it does EXPLAIN the process. I just feel as though at the very least there should have been a listening option/text to speech option, or otherwise have the readings broken up into videos.",4
104645,i am not understanding the the materia,4
104646,I have enjoyed this course.,4
104647,"Eh, not great to be honest.",3
104648,"This course is not worth taking, especially if you have to pay for it! It is boring and you hardly learn anything. Do not take this class, it is not worth your money.",1
104649,I saw a few typos and missing translations in the English transcripts. One minor issue in a quiz/test.,4
104650,"I found the course very helpful in terms of vocabulary and grammar and I will continue practicing with it. There are a few errors here and there that need to be corrected in the quizzes and such. The main issue is that while it is billed as a vocabulary course, and starts with simple concepts, it is more of an intermediate than a beginner course for someone who has never studied a foreign language before. It is more like a course for padding out your vocabulary and practicing grammatical constructions than a language learning course.",4
104651,I learned a lot from this course.,5
104652,Great course!!,5
104653,"Awesome course, great picture on entrepreneurship and forms of investment and financing",5
104654,"Love this course, especially in planning a new start-up. I can take these lessons and incorporate them into my planning process. That is precisely what I'm going to do.",5
104655,very helpful and inspiring,5
104656,Really enjoyed how the professors touched on many different avenues of financing.,5
104657,"very insightful, help me to understand basic Venture Capital knowledge!",5
104658,Really liked the Pitch and Executive Summary section,5
104659,"One again a wonderful and informative course. Being a former Wall Street veteran, I thought I know almost everything and these Professor taught me so much in such detail. Now I know everything!!! HaHa..almost! Thank you Wharton!",5
104660,Interesting,5
104661,Great course!,5
104662,"The class would have been better if the financing options/strategies had been further categorized according to different stages of development of the startup. I liked most of the content. Nevertheless, speaking of issues like IPO and several stages of funding did not seem relevant to a great majority of startups, at least for early stage ones. (As figures demonstrated in the class, many failed and the mostly adopted early stage funding options is from family & friends).Anyway, it really was a great class, intense, interesting and important in entrepreneurship! Thank you!",5
104663,A course that give you the insights of financing your venture. You will get key resources related with the valuation of startups and many other tools to address funding. I highly recommend this course!,5
104664,"some lectures were very american-reality-oriented, the terms were very difficult to understand, although the information provided was very useful Thanks!",4
104665,Awesome course! Thank you for putting it up together.,5
104666,"Excellent course. Brilliant use of real business case scenarios to help illustrate the theories and concepts. But more importantly this course was taught by exceptional well talented instructors, and thus making the course very interesting. Thank you all",5
104667,This is very useful with the,5
104668,"Course was quite helpful, but it is good for only beginners. Thanks for Offering this course.",4
104669,Very informative course! Worth every penny!,5
104670,Amazing as the other courses. But I think too superficial on building financial projections. Information hard to find.,4
104671,"i really enjoy this course, opened my eyes to a new form to evolution my busiiness",5
104672,"Great Course !Aspirant Entrepreneurs many times make mistakes in the Innovative companies financial planning, This is great Course to Think about Financial Health of the startup and avoid Serious, OUT of CASH mistakes ...",5
104673,Great and Excellent thoughts and course material.,5
104674,Lot off myths about the finances were cleared in this course. The quizes were also good.Thank you professors for the valuable inputs.,5
104675,I only can repeat my review of the past three coursers: excellent! Would do it ANY time again. Congratulations for this great course.,5
104676,"Probably the best course, although a bit short in content. I learnt a lot from it, thank you!",5
104677,"I thought the videos and interviews were great but I would prefer these separated from the lectures on tangible material. I kind of feel like the course was rudderless and just gave some headlines and then said to go figure it out on your own, but be inspired by all of these extremely successful people. I would like to see the course get into more depth, for example where to start on market research. Where to start on budgeting, and how to go about developing some of these specific business aspects. I enjoy shlmo's lectures but just wish some of this course ""zoomed in"" to me and seemed too ""zoomed out""",3
104678,"What a way Dr. Maital teaches. Everybody should take his courses which are excellent. When I hear his lesson, I would like to keep in my head all what he says, and don't forget even a dot.Thank you very much to you all: Dr. Maital, Coursera and the wonder people from Technion.",5
104679,this course help me to see the big picture of startups,5
104680,"Since the very first week I knew this course was worth taking it. Shlomo is TRULY an amazing teacher, he is very instructive and very inspiring. The slides he provides (that you can also download) are very helpful too. I haven't finished the course yet, I am in week 5, but I am very pleased with the path that every lesson takes and I am in love with the way he instructs. Thanks very much Sholomo! You are an awesome teacher.",5
104681,"Shlomo is comfy presenter, I wish him all the best.",5
104682,Excellent Course.Professor Shlomo Maital is a great teacher,5
104683,"Nice Professor, who is able to present the transition between research and practice.Very good hands-on assignments.Toolbox allows direct implementation of what has been learned.Even though I knew a lot of strategy theories it gave me knew and hands-on insights.Thank you!",5
104684,Well this course gave me great tools for my startup. I recommend this as must have course before doing any kind of stratup,5
104685,great course...u wanna start a business? ..this is your index,5
104686,Short and Apt classes. Great amount of information shared in each class.,5

104689,"Excellent material, Prof. Shlomo. As always expected from your distinctness.Looking forward for the coming. -Zyad",5
104690,"That's a fantastic idea and the course - thank you for giving us an opportunity to study the most important subject for future economy development. I have been working in Finance (Financial and Management Accounting) for so long - but I met the 'social margin' for the first time.It also proved to me that creativity, innovation and change can't be described as an linear function any more - this is purely biological function with a high uncertainty element (defined as a complex and dynamic changes) .Professor Shlomo Maital has made a significant progress comparing with the first course of that specialization - he is very engaged in what he working on (what was in the 1st course as well), however he looks more relaxed and opened making lectures.Thx a lot !",5
104691,Thank you Professor!I want to learn from you more because you teach what I don't know and what are identical to lessons I've learnt at my university!,5
104692,"I really liked it, the teacher's explanation are clear and motivational.",4

104694,I loved this course! I have taken a variety of other terrorism courses over the years and this is definitely one of the best courses I have ever been involved in. I will recommend this course to anyone seeking to expand their knowledge base!,5
104695,I enjoyed going through this course. The material was fascinating and the instructors provided great detail regarding the data and research.,5
104696,Start is a great program with lots of resources,5

104702,"I really enjoyed this course and learned a lot. Much of the knowledge I thought I had coming into the course was erroneous or skewed by the media. Highly recommend this course to anyone in the law enforcement field/homeland sec field, or who just wants to learn more on the subject!",5

104708,Great course! The information was great. I enjoyed the format and the instructor was great.,4
104709,"This is probably the best course I have taken so far on Coursera, very informative , truly inspiring, and impacting me in a positive way as it has induced me to review my life, my achievements and career, challenges I met, analyse them and reconsider my approaches to self-evaluation, goal-setting and fulfillment.Thank you very much!",5

104713,"Really great professor and material! I found the content to be relevant and the tools to be practical and useful. Also, the course fit into my busy life (i.e. there aren't hours and hours of lectures to watch), yet I still got a lot out of every week!

104717,"The topic is very interesting and the instructor is sharing some interesting data, however I found the way she talks too exaggerated, and the end it sounds like lot of empty phrases, not giving me anything I could put into practice.",3
104718,"Thank you very much for the great course!Whereas Inspiring Leadership through Emotional Intelligence course was the basic for me, Conversations That Inspire course has helped me to spread positive emotions and to inspire people, Women in Leadership: Inspiring Positive Change has boosted tremendously my self-confidence and self-efficacy skills. I’ve gained clarity on my Leadership vision and the actions which I need to take in order to reach it. I have better understanding of the different tools for leadership and much more. Thank YOU so much for everything!Looking forward to the next course from Inspired Leadership specialization! I feel inspired!",5
104719,Unusual approach to compliance issues from ethical perspective with lots of case study and wonderful lectors,5

104722,"great course, clear and attractive! Make learner think! Fully reconmended",5
104723,"Absorbing, enlightening, practical and all round great course - highly recommended.",5
104724,"This course is well worthwhile. Its main objective is make you think about ethical issues, as opposed to making decisions in a rote manner. Their argument about ethical blindness is persuasive and it helps you to understand corporate behaviors that appear to be inconceivable (Enron, Ford Pinto, etc).My hope was to learn more about guidelines for making corporate decisions that have internal economic costs or benefits, with associated external social benefits or costs. However, I was assured that this would not be possible in the confines of this course. But this course does make you hungry for more. Hopefully, this faculty will be able to offer a follow-up course in the near future.",4
104725,"Exceptional course! It should be offered universally to employers and employees all over the world, as well as university students!",5
104726,"Excellent course, well-planned and carefully executed. Thanks!",5

104732,"very well structured, delivered and animated. well researched and with good take aways in practical business life",5
104733,"The structure is not clear, with similar ideas coming up several times. Examples can be far-fetched (Britannica for ethical blindness ?). The teachers read the script and sometimes stumble on the words. An idea is explained in 3 minutes when 30s are enough. I am getting bored and very disappointed because it is a very important topics these days. I quit. Thank you anyways",1
104734,"Amazing Course. Informative, Productive and Fulfilling.",5
104735,Really worth investing time into!!!,4
104736,something new!,5
104737,"Great course, very structured, systemised and clear.Good examples as cases described, and give a very clear understanding of the reasoning, context and why and what is important.Very recommended!",5
104738,Excellent content and methodology.,5
104739,A great addition and extension of other behavioral economics material on the same subject.,5
104740,"I've really learned a lot from this course, thank",5
104741,"It was easy to understand, it has nice rityhm to follow",4
104742,"Great course. The level of depth of the analysis on how and why good people behave unethically exceeded my expectations. A very interesting cocktail of psychology, ethics, behavioural economics and sociology. Recommended for everyone.",5
104743,"One of the best courses I've ever attended, so good that I'm taking it again",5
104744,Very well prepared and presented. The syllabus is well designed. Study objectives are clearly stated at the beginning of each session and recapped at the end. Test make sense and reconfirm understanding.I can only recommend it. Thank you very much!,5
104745,"Interesting and well structured course!Started off great, felt like needed a boost in the endOverall a valuable course",4
104746,"I really apreciated this course. It was my first experience with coursera. I did a lot of peer review and saw that a lot of my ""classmates"" used a lot more than the 1000 allowed words. The texts of the videos should be in another format than just ""*.txt"" because thus they are quite hard to read... But beside this I learned a lot.",5
104747,"I already participated in 2015 but was unable to complete the course (made around 25%) due to lack of time to follow the lessons. I remember having learned a lot and read interesting ""stories/experiences"" from other students in the course forums. Highly recommended.",5
104748,Interesting concepts - but gets a little repetitive,4
104749,Had a great time listening to the lecture videos. Very informative and insightful indeed! Thank you Coursera :),5
104750,This is fantastic. It answered my long sought questions on why bad decisions are so rampant.,5
104751,Concepts weren't explained properly. The instructor was going too fast.,3
104752,Material was interesting. Did not enjoy the teaching method of Prof. Caffo. Very scripted and skips way too fast through some of the equations and R code he's trying to teach.,3
104753,Nicely started but bit hurried up at the end,4
104754,"More visual explanations would help with concept. It is good where there are them, but not so good where there isn't.",3
104755,"Statistics is not easy, but it is very powerful to understand real data problems.",5
104756,It is top part of all Data Science educational program. Work hard and you will get success.,5
104757,It is good but you have to study by yourself using different material as the video contents are not enough to understand the subject,4
104758,"I think the ""homework"" exercises are a very good idea, butsince the course is very fast paced, more exercises are needed.",4
104759,nice course to review basic statistics,5
104760,"Statistics was relatively new to me, so it was a steep learning; Overall I liked it.",4
104761,great course and I like the way Brian explain,5
104762,Challenging course but very helpful.,4
104763,"The course materials are well designed and delivered. I have taken basic inferential statistics at various levels in the past like 5 years, this is a really nice refresh and update (with respective the use of R). I would recommend this courses taught by Dr. Brian Caffo to others who are interested in the subject.",5
104764,"To tackle such key concepts and tools of statistics, you need the appropriate time. Too much material covered in this course. I tend to think that revising the approach to this course as two 4 weeks modules would allow to both go more in depth at a more appropriate pace.",3
104765,"I'm in the data science specialization. Statistical Inference was my 6th course. All of them have been on a spectrum of good to great. But Statistical Inference is a mixed bag for me.First, if you are thinking about this course, take some time reading the other reviews. I find many of them resonate with my experience leading to 1/5 stars.One reviewer who gave 5/5 stars said they loved the course. They suggested that other reviewers who gave low ratings are ones that dropped out. I don't find this to be the case. Many of the low rating reviewers actually did pass the course and said very similar things as those who did not pass the course.Another reviewer enjoyed Brian's dry humour. I must have missed the jokes after watching each video 5 times...For the record, I almost aced this course. The reason for not getting 100% was because I was so annoyed with one of the quizes that I didn't bother taking it again to correct it. I decided living with 8/10 correct questions was better than having a stroke while in the pursuit of two extra points. Yes, that is how much I hated this course.The first 2 weeks of the course were the worst. I dropped out for about a month (because of life priorities). Then I couldn't get motivated. 1 month turned into 2 months, then into 3 months. I basically took the entire summer off. Finally I bit the bullet and completed the final 2 weeks. The 3rd week of the course wasn't actually all that bad (though the quiz was terrible). The 4th week felt like the first 2 weeks...terrible.(By the way, it's a mistake to take such a long break. I had to re-watch the first videos to recall things for the remaining quizzes).If you don't have some sort of statistical knowledge (or inherent aptitude), be prepared to work four times longer on the course. For all your quiz and assignment time-to-completion estimates, multiply them by 4 or more. Seriously, I spent probably 10 hours on the final assignment which said it should only take 2 hours. Each quiz took me an entire Sunday afternoon (My partner was not pleased).Now here is where things get awkward. I hated the course .... BUT....I learned things that actually stuck. So in THAT regard, I give this course extra stars. It accomplished something that some University courses could not. I even found myself USING the new knowledge in real world problems. So ironically, is that not a sign that it's ...dare I say...a GOOD course?Would I take the course again? I actually might, but ONLY because of its place in the overall certification. If you are a prospective student wondering if you should take the course as a standalone course, I don't think I could recommend it, because there are far better ways to learn. In fact, just doing the Swirl lessons could be good enough.If you are a prospective student and you want the certification, then you'll HAVE to take the course. Why are you even bothering to read reviews?So I'm giving the course 3/5 stars. If I gave it 1 or 2 stars, my review would be clustered with the majority. If I gave it 4 or 5 stars, I'd be lying.",3
104766,Learnt many new things. It was good.,3
104767,"This course seems weirdly balanced between assuming one knows very little about statistics while also assuming one is intimately familiar with statistics notation and terminology. It would probably be better if the data science track had an optional ""intro to statistics"" class that can take more time to let students familiarize themselves with the terminology, and then a separate ""ins and outs of probability testing in R"" for those already familiar. This course seems to try and bite off more than it can chew by attempting to be both at the same time.Still, the lectures are interesting and the material is important to learn / cover.",2
104768,My name is Jose Antonio. I am looking for a new Data Scientist career ( https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseantonio11)I did this course to get new knowledge about Data Science and better understand the technology and your practical applications.The course was excellent and the classes well taught by the Teachers.Congratulations to Coursera team and Teachers.,5
104769,A very good course!,5
104770,Poor quality audio. Monotonous lecture style with frequent inaccuracies in delivery (says one thing but actually means another). I found my motivation and performance dropped sharply in contrast to prior lectures in this series.,1
104771,Excellent course to get up to speed on important statistics concepts,5
104772,"Nice course, but need more detailed one for those new to statistics.",4
104773,I enjoyed the lectures. The lecturer was very clear on the explanations.,5
104774,"Difficult class, moving through a heavy amount of statistics material, but very useful. May be helpful to take this course more slowly and look for other online sources to supplement the lecture material.",4
104775,"For the length of time of this course, I though it did a good job of covering the topics. Luckily, I've had multiple previous courses on this material. I only wish there were more homeworks/project covering the analysis of real data with less theoretical work.",4
104776,Content is very good overall. Presentation could be more engaging,5
104777,Statistical inference is one of the most useful things in data analysis.It was very interesting and useful course!!! Many thanks to authors!,5
104778,Good course. Quite thorough. Nice blend of R programming and theory.,5
104779,"This is of course my personal opinion, with all due respect for the Tutors. Plus, it has to be noted that I am writing this as a Mathematics graduate, and this course was most probably not meant for people with any background. However, I have seen similar opinions from people like me. Probability calculus and statistics are both enormous areas of mathematics. Introducing them in a 4-week course seems a really bad idea to me. The probability part was in my opinion far better than the statistical, the origin of every new concept was clear. In my opinion, the optimal solution for the course would be to create a separate, longer course in PC and stats and require knowledge of the two for taking Data Science Specialization.",3
104780,"For starters, it will demand a lot of out of class studies. It took me three months to go through the basics in Khan Academy before attempting it - and after that it was straight forward.",4
104781,The ideas and concepts explained here are really important but are explained/written in a bit messy manner.,3
104782,"These are complex topics, and just the quick overview doesn't fully explain them.",3
104783,"This course should not be presented by video. I loose lot of time by learn with others supports than Coursera.Even if I notice and appreciate the works to produce these supports by the teacher, I'm not a big fan at all.",2
104784,Indept videos and materials should be provided for this course. The lectures are not enough to understand the Statistics involved in data science.,3
104785,"Important material, poorly taught.",1
104786,"Not so easy, but extremely interesting. Highly recommended to anyone.",5
104787,Basic statistics course....could have been a requisite,4
104788,2 Thumbs Up,5
104789,"Not explained well, had to take another statistical inference course. Not worth the money.",1
104790,Very useful and informative course.,5
104791,"Kudos to Caffo for using charts and examples to provide a lot of insight without using a lot of math. However, I would personally like the math to be presented, too (e.g., the 'off-center' T-distribution, etc.). This could be done is special sections of the book and lectures, as is done in the Regression Models class.",5
104792,"Sorry to say, but for me as a non-native english speaker, most videos are hard to follow. Its because speaker talks fast, unclean and with bad sound quality. Of course I'm not used to the mathematical english terms. Also the many animations with the slides made it hard for me.",2
104793,This course should be in 3-4 courses.Maybe a full specialization,5
104794,"I would say it is good quality content and appreciate the efforts of the authors . Though it just introduces the topic , it better to follow up with more rigorous online content/book, in order to understand the topic more deeply .",4
104795,"So far this is the poorest course in DS specialiation. Coins and dices all the time, Brian reads to the camera. It is just like reading a book, a very boring one. Examples from real life could boost interest.",1
104796,This is a good course to set up for further learning. One gets exposure to topics in intro and intermediate statistic and starts to grasp how intricate the web of statistics it all the while the focus is on Hypothesis testing which is one cornerstones of statistics.,5
104797,Very helpful course,5
104798,A great course with great collection of tests and assignments. Great contribution by the teachers too!,5
104799,This course is very helpfull,5
104800,"This course is clear and well structured, it is great that the author has created a companion book.",5
104801,"This course is exciting opportunity to ""connect the dots"" in introductory statistics. It is challenging, but very informative and engaging.",5
104802,It's a very interesting topic but I had to rely on a text book to understand it! I struggled to understand the lectures and reconcile it back to the quizes.,2
104803,The course should be more elaborated. I had to go through other reference books on statistics to understand all the topics.,5
104804,The course is useful and essential not only for those studying statistics but machine learning,4
104805,"The course is a very quick run through of basic statistics and not very intuitive for people without much statistics/maths background. The swirl exercises is a very good practical learning tutorial that supplements the course, but overall it still lacks on the conceptual aspect. Personally, I have to occasionally refer to other basic statistics materials to be able to follow the flow and understand the lectures.For the course project, there is a huge discrepancy in what the project expect the students to perform and the peer grading criteria. As a basic statistic course, the correctness of the estimation/ calculation/ assumptions is integral in any analysis but the grading criteria mostly neglect all this aspect. Hopefully the course admin can rectify this aspect of the course.",3
104806,"To be honest, I like the subject but found the course material and content not very well structured. I missed more mathematical foundation.",3
104807,"It felt like there were a lot of jumps between basic statistical formulae and abstractions thereof. While I don't think it was inappropriate for a course on statistics in itself, it felt rather out of place in the rest of the sequence of this course.",3
104808,Great Course. Material much more challenging than courses in the program to date.,4
104809,"Good course. It could be more clear and deep in some concepts, especially in the final part of week 4.",4
104810,Very Nice!,5
104811,Very disappointing!!!!!!!too much emphasis on mathematical notations....where are the practical applications?lack of examples....it seemed more of a prose than a lecture....would not recommend to a beginner.Period,1
104812,"3.5 - Good, but I feel some of the explanations were over complicated a little compared to other coursers such as openintro to stats. Overall good experience though",3
104813,Pretty awesome,5
104814,"Covers basic statistics (Mean, Variance, Simple Z and T tests). Not what I was expecting as Inference. Multiple testing of data is a sign of poor experimental design and should be avoided, not adjusted for. Bootstrapping is not a new idea and has been used in other fields.",1
104815,the course provides the necessary information and practice assignments to build a grasp of the topic. It seems a little fast paced and people from non-statistics background may find it a bit difficult.,4
104816,Very informative lecture and Brian explained concepts pretty well. Thanks..,4
104817,"It's not the math that is hard, it's the phrasing, vocabulary and semantics.",4
104818,Very Informative. Have to devote quite a bit of time to it though.,5
104819,"I learned a great deal from this course. Methods, testing and most of all logical processes with proven with evidence. I understand this course only touches the surface, but it will serve me as a catalyst to continue exploring the field.",5
104820,Difficult one. But made it.,4
104821,"Although the instructor is very good, it would be nice to have a direct link to more references that explains the basics without skipping certain steps that a beginner may find difficult. The course is pretty good and if the student is proactive he/she will find a way to self-learn those missing steps :)",5
104822,"I am interested in taking the Regression Models course and took this one as a refreshment for the statistics knowledge I already had. I found the course well done and the resources easy to use and throughout.As a negative point I would mention that as the topics get more involved, the time dedicated to each one seems to decrease, to the point where both MULTIPLE TESTING and GROUP COMPARISONS are pretty much a briefing, which kind of defeates the purpose of including them on the course in the first place...I give the course a 8.5 out of 10.",4
104823,"I thought the course material was great but I think the grading criteria for the assignment should be more rigorous and check for proper methodology/application of techniques, just because I'd like to know that my approach to a given data analysis is sound and that the conclusions I draw from running tests, p-value adjustment, calculating power, etc. are statistically valid.Overall a great primer! Thanks to Brian & Jeff for putting this together :)",4
104824,This is the toughest content yet of the Data Science specialisation but probably the most valuable piece so far. Video content is good but moves along very quickly so finding another book on statistics to back up the course content will be a great benefit.,5
104825,"I've not found this course organized pedagogically speaking. The organization, insofar as ""here is a list of stuff I'll be teaching"" makes sense. But a lot of the ""teaching"" is ill suited for someone looking to learn with a minimal statistical background. It's incredibly frustrating and disheartening.",1
104826,"Brian Caffo is explaining the Statistical Inference methodically, but he could work on making the lectures less tiresome and monotonous.",3
104827,"The sections on bootstrapping and permutations were great! The instructor does much better, information is easier to follow (better and slower explanations), and the instructor is more engaging when he is not reading from his notes.",3
104828,"Nicely outlined and broad in scope, but Brian's presentation is kind of dry. It often appears that he is reading off a script, and sometimes his emphasis on technical details takes away from ease of understanding.",3
104829,GOOD KNOWLEDGE OF USING STATISTIC TEST IN R. HOPE TO ADD MORE MATERIAL,4
104830,"This course is great, but Brian is certainly not a good instructor. He does not explain things well, and articulate examples. I had to take Statistical Inference from Duke university to pass this course.",2
104831,"Materials need to be updated - there are way too many inconsistencies between videos, exercises, and slides.",3
104832,I thoroughly enjoyed the swirl mode of interactive learning provided in the course. It helped me in understanding the power concept in statistical inference.,5
104833,"Great course to learn about statistical inference, traditionally a tricky subject to teach. Well done!",5
104834,Probably more math than required at this stage,4
104835,"This was the toughest of all the Data Science courses so far. Without the statistical inference book, the practical exercises and the swirls it would have been very challenging to pass the course. These were very valuable tools. The videos that are available when I couldn't get a practical exercise right, also helped me a lot.I majored in mathematical statistics 40 years ago, but have never used it in my whole career. But in my opinion this course explained the concepts much better than how it was done 40 years ago. Congratulations to everybody involved.I have learned so much and was really proud of myself when I passed this one.",4
104836,a basic course of inference but i think perfecto for this mooc,4
104837,I really like the use of media by this professor. The class itself is far more analytical and work than the preceding classes.,5
104838,"I love the exercises in R. The class is really good and very interactive, you cannot get bored in any moment.",5
104839,"If I wasn't already familiar with statistics, I would find the lectures and course book difficult to follow. If future revisions to the course are made, consider including a cheat sheet with the notation, parameter abbreviations used, etc. It would also be helpful to rewrite (or at least include a reference back to) the equation being used in the example calculations instead of immediately filling numbers in.",2
104840,"Great course, very challenging . Well presented , great material .",5
104841,"Understanding statistics is not easy, but caffo makes us to understand them easily... Thank you very much Mr. Caffo Now i can say that i know some statistics.",5
104842,"A lot of the concepts in Stats Inf - although simple when you think about it and used pretty much every day - I felt were difficult to understand at first. Wikipedia and some other online sources, and youtube videos, were more helpful but I think the real issue lay in the teaching style. I won't knock Mr. Caffo like some of the others here have because at the end of the day everyone learns differently. What works for some might not work for others and unfortunately his style did not suit my learning requirements.My rating is purely based on the content which I think can be simplified by giving more visual examples. I am rating this after taking the 'Regression Models' course and in that course it is MUCH easier because he gives ""real time"" and visual examples of what, eg Residuals, mean or represent. Just that alone made a huge difference and it then helps me focus on how to write the R code rather than trying to understand the math. Hope this helps!",2
104843,"This course means well but the lectures in the first half of the course are not good. The instructor seems to take a midway between rigorous mathematics, using terms like robust etc while at the same time also trying to keep it easily accessible. RD Peng's courses take a much better approach in that they keep things at one end of the spectrum (simple language). Having a background in theoretical physics and computer science, this duality in this course is very confusing for me. Also, I do not need to see a tiny, grainy video inset of the instructor during the lecture videos.",2
104844,"The only reason for enrolling is to complete the data science specialization, though it may make you reconsider continuing with it. The instructor and provided materials fail to adequately explain the concepts this course is supposed to cover, and do not prepare students for the quizzes or assignments. If you don't know statistics you won't learn it here. If you know statistics, you don't need this course.",1
104845,Great course ! Important for those who are either going to take the Regression analysis or those who are working with data and want to do same basic hypothesis testing.,5
104846,"It is nice course!Amazingly challenging, thought provoking.",4
104847,"Brian is a very good lecturer. Even though he is knowledgeable, he goes through everything step by step and makes sure you don't fall off the wagon at any point. I had fun doing this course!",5
104848,Sometimes videos was difficult to understand. I needed to watch most of lectures twice. On other hand it was worth doing and I've learned basic statistics.,4
104849,"The course on statistical inference is a crash course on frequentist statistics; in my opinion the contents are appropriate for statistical inference, though most of the concepts that are taught deserve more attention, or perhaps split throughout other courses.Nevertheless, Brian makes a terrific job to compress all of these topics into a single month course which is impressive - for someone familiar with statistics it's actually an enjoyable course.",4
104850,"The course is good, but not very challenging. Anybody having done any course in statistic would have little to no information from the first two weeks. Only week 4 was interesting to me, dealing with boostrapping.The teacher is very clear and chooses the subject in a clever way. One always understands what he or she is doing.",3
104851,Informative course,5
104852,Very clear and useful. Excellent course,5
104853,This course is poorly taught. The instructors often speed through significant concepts and are generally unable to explain the concepts clearly to someone who does not have a major statistics background.,2
104854,Excellent course to know the basics of data science,5
104855,"1) Not worth the money and time. The reason I say this is because the same concepts are reviewed and explained in lot more fun, creative, and interactive manner at other free of cost resources like Khan academy, youTube channels, etc2) Who is the audience? I don't think instructor has any idea of target audience. Are these meant for novice or advanced learners ?3) Why so serious? My philosophy is that if I want to appear in video, i better learn to cheer up. Seriously i mean after dealing with rush hour traffic and psychopath boss, I don't want to see a unhappy serious looking face throughout a course. Not good for my heart!Sorry if it is a mean (not statistic mean!) or anything but I have come here investing my money and time (out of my family time) . And I am not happy with this course.The only reason I have to complete this course is because of the requirement in specialization degree. I won't mind getting my refund back on this course.",1
104856,"Despite the pertinent content, the way the instructor gave the classes could have been way more intuitive. You'll find videos on the web that can help you with the subjects covered and do a better job explaining the concepts. Disappointing.",2
104857,"There are better (Free!) courses out there to learn basic inferential statistics. Khan Academy is a great place to start, and Udacity has a great class that gives a good intuitive understanding. The main reason to take this class is if you are trying to finish the entire Data Science program. Otherwise, look elsewhere for an intro stats class. The instructor clearly knows the material, the class just does not do a good job of transfering that knowledge.",1
104858,The instructor is about as convoluted as you can possibly get with his explanations.,1
104859,"If, like me, you do not have an understanding of the subject matter then you may struggle to complete this in the time frame. I had to retake this multiple times and found getting the basics (From Khan) first then returning helped me finally understand and pass the tests.",4
104860,"Well balanced course with a lot of practical examples which help to understand the theory. I apply statistical inference methods myself, and nevertheless I've found new topics here. Thank you!",5
104861,"I liked this course, and found the lectures interesting and would give them perfect marks on being instructive. However, I found that there are some speling errors here and there, and a remarkable frequency of sirens audible in the lectures (is JHU in a difficult neighborhood?), and sometimes it was hard to recover the plots from the git repository.But, more importantly the curriculum and teach was very good, and the use of examples after the theory makes it much easier to grasp difficult concepts.",4
104862,"Touches all the key concepts of statisticas inference. A bit challenging, even more if you don't have previous knowledge of statistics.",4
104863,"lectures notes is not details enough, had to google around other materials to grasp the courser work better",3
104864,"The instructors approach in this course is very cursory. He tries to split the difference in going through the mechanics/mathematical theory and practical applications. As a result, he fails at both. I think it would be better to leave the mathematics and application learning to supporting materials and focus on explaining the theory and concepts of statistical inference in the lectures.",2
104865,"I have to admit, that most of the videos confused more than they helped. For most of the topics I simply went to KhanAcademy and got it easily there and I was asking myself, why a topic was made so complicated. I have the same issue with the next course. I highly recommend to start visual explanations of what you want to achieve instead of throwing formulars at people and confuse them. IN KhanAcademy e.g. they do exactly this and you got the point and if you got the point, the formular wasn't such a big thing anymore.",2
104866,conprehansive,5
104867,Hard but well worth the effort.,5
104868,worst course of the specialization.,1
104869,"As someone who's new to the world of data science and doesn't have a university degree this course was very hard to get a good grasp on.That's partly the ""cause"" of how the course was taught which was assuming you had all the knowledge at hand of all the stuff Statistical Inference is about.For people that are starting this stuff it might be nice to have a introductory course of Statistical Inference as I did not finish this course by just watching the course video's and additional information, I had to look up additional resources which explained the material better.Still, a big thank you for explaining statistical inference and opening my eyes regarding this topic, it surely helped getting me to the next step in what Data Science is all about and makes it ever more interesting!",3
104870,"This was a real crash course on statistics and math theory and, giving also all the tools for data analyses. It might be nice to have more 'common language' examples, that would connect ideas of population and distribution to solving real life problems and taking real life decisions.",4
104871,"This course covers a wide range of powerful statistical concepts. The best way to work through this is to run R code as you go through the examples. If you are not comfortable with R, make sure to take the intro to R course first.",5
104872,Good course. Very interesting.pace is very high,4
104873,"Covers a lot of info too fast! Some concepts are not clearly explained , had to surf online to get better understanding. Overall, fine course, very practical.",3
104874,"Personally, I feel that the way of sharing and teaching was assuming everyone is an expert in this subject. This course need to be reviewed to make it more suitable to various groups of profession as not everyone has the same level of mathematics background.",1
104875,The slides are very difficult to follow. It could be better designed,1
104876,"Need to improve the clarity of the lectures, but it´s a good course though.",5
104877,Outstanding material. You can scale the difficulty and depth on the subject as you wish. Great source and references. (Recommend seeing the videos at 1.5 x speed though).,5
104878,very concise and well taught,5
104879,"There is few programming in this course. However, in this class, you will learn a lot of statistical model to analyze data.",5
104880,Very difficult to understand and follow,1
104881,The amount of materials is more than course period. You may need to study a couple of other resources to understand the course.,3
104882,"Great course, could use some review though. Still give it a big thumbs up!",4
104883,Too much covered.,1
104884,This course was very important for my work. I learned so much and I want to say thanks to the professors.,5
104885,A foundation course for data scientists! Basic statistics from University of Amsterdam on Coursera would be nice pre-requisite to this one !,4
104886,"Terrible instruction in the videos and unclear directions. I'd avoid this course if possible, but it's required for the specialization. New videos should be shot and inspiration taken from more instructive and interesting guides, like The Cartoon Guide to Statistics by Gonick & Smith.",1
104887,It was a really informative course.,5
104888,"This course actually helped me to practice and to obtain a better intuition of the most basic Statistical Inference ideas. It covers up little content, but it focuses more on the practical understanding than on the maths. After taking it I feel like I can go and take a much more math-heavy course and I wont feel lost.",4
104889,Great course!,5
104890,"Content was Great, difficult to understand some times. I had to review more sources to get the clearer idea.Totally enjoyed the challenge.",4
104891,"The lectures for this class are incredibly weak. Later lectures by the same professor are reasonable and decently structured. These lectures need to be redone. The quizzes are either out-of-order or expect you to do a lot of research on your own beyond the class notes and topics. The class project is unbelievably simple, and the final metric for the class project includes duplication and one portion of the grade assigned simply if you feel the person you're grading ""tried"".",1
104892,To be honest I don't think this is worth the money.,1
104893,"good curse, but it's hard by short time to study all lessons and practice it.",4
104894,"It is a good course, well taught. A full comprehension of the subjects however needs more work and research than what is needed to pass the course.",4
104895,Great course! I learnt a lot! And it even was fun.,5
104896,Great and Excellent thoughts and course material.,5
104897,"This course is tough, informative. Good for people who want a summary of all the statistical concepts you can use for data science. You'll get the most out of this course not by expecting it to be beginner, because it is not. This course is best supplemented by having background knowledge in statistics. Meaning, learners would be much better off if he/she did some statistical course before. This course will provide the practical experience of implementing statistical concepts in R.",5
104898,Excellent course well explained by Brian Caffo with both theory and practical examples!,5
104899,"Concepts are very hard to understand, even with some background knowledge in statistics.",2
104900,"It was very interesting, descriptive and joyful. I really loved this course.",5
104901,"Very poor instruction and organization of topics, very poor explanation of core concepts. I learned more from reading other sources while taking the class than I did from the lectures.",2
104902,Very useful course with lots of applied knowledge. One gets to learn how to use R to perform the hypothesis testing.,5
104903,Great class; very informative! I was surprised to see that Brian mentioned the Central Limit Theorem; he definitely knows what he is talking about.,5
104904,"Seemed like a ""ghost"" course, issues reported with the swirl package, duplicate questions in the final assessment, where is the instructor ?",2
104905,"The worst course I've ever taken.Bad sound quality, dead discussion forums, not possible to understand material without external (not mentioned in the course) sources.",1
104906,"The course is really interesting, but I believe the professor approach to describe and explain the topics is really confusing. I had to search other resources to clarify the topics.",3
104907,"I've taken several statistics, data science, and R courses. This is one of the worst. I took others' advice, and I also strongly suggest looking to other sources to learn Statistical Inference before taking this course. Khan Academy, DataCamp, Udacity, Duke (Coursera), and Columbia (edX) all have great courses. Though they vary in depth, each leaves you with a good understanding of the concepts they teach.",1
104908,"The topics from this course are very important and might be considered convoluted at times, so it is nice to see that Brian makes them actually easy to understand. Very comprehensive and has nice examples.",4
104909,Great Course. All concepts are explained clearly.,5
104910,It was a pretty good course with really great examples. I feel the instruction was a bit too droll and mechanical.,4
104911,"Very useful !Teacher is awesome, statement is clear and simple.love this course!",5
104912,"completely missed the explanation part of the teaching. Why use n-1 for standard deviation? ""Because of degrees of freedom"" Only mention, no further explanation. Just no explanations of anything in this course. I looked at the biostats course by the same guy. Same story. Teaching is more than just saying the facts, you have to explain things, lead the understanding. The materials are just not there, not in the book either.",2
104913,Content runs a bit fast but good course for stat inference with R focus.,3
104914,This session will help me boost my skills.,4
104915,Good to know the basics,5
104916,Poor concepts exposition with a bad teaching method.,2
104917,"this is heavy material, and I suggest it be broken down to two separate courses, and the author take his time in explaining the various concepts in much more detail vs. trying to cram them within 5 or 10 minute sessions. I know I wasn't the only one struggling to keep up with the teacher after week 2.",2
104918,This course was more like a glossary. Not quite good but practical,2
104919,Awesome Course !!,5
104920,Teaching material is fine. The Professor's explanation is monotonic and he uses textual definitions rather than simple explanations,2
104921,Steep Learning Curve. Swirl exercises are important for this course,3
104922,"It's quite involved, fast and not explained thoroughly in some places.",3
104923,"An Excellently conceived course with good content and a competitively efficient evaluation components viz., assignments and quizzes.",5
104924,The course is very difficult to comprehend..Moreover the examplanations given ar not concise and brief..,1
104925,Have not taken the class but paid late in the session for the remainder of the specialization. Cannot get the 3/21 session which is what I planned on enrolling into. No help on the Coursera site. Maybe this will trigger a response,4
104926,Swirl is recommended for a better understanding of the course,5
104927,Teaching material is very good. But I feel the Professor's explanation is monotonic and uses more of textual definitions rather than simple explanations which are required for starters.,3
104928,pretty helpful.,5
104929,"This course took me 3 weeks longer than anticipated, and I'm not sure it was the difficulty of the material. A lot of this information is review for me, so I am confused why it took so much time to complete. There were new topics, and I did enjoy working through the homework questions.",4
104930,"This course is very difficult to follow, not because the topics are hard or too technical but mostly due to lecturer's poor job in explaining and creating a narrative.",1
104931,"Do NOT recommend. Very poorly explained. Refers to some concepts without introducing, introduces others without explaining. Spends most of the time looking to the computer screen instead of toward you and reading the text instead of explaining in understandable manner.",1
104932,"Content covered in this course was hard to learn, both because it was pitched at a level that realistically was more akin to a wrap up of content already covered (when in fact it was all new content) and because the instructor, Brian Caffo, has not a style that was conducive to teaching.The instructor often would launch into a topic, and then speed through a calculation with basically no explanation.In terms of time, this was one of the most intensive courses in the specialisation, and I'd recommend taking this course alone (not concurrently with other courses) for that very reason.",1
104933,"The subject is interesting, but the explanations are a little confusing. May need more diverse real-life examples to relate.",3
104934,"Not beginner friendly, might be good as a refresher for grad students",2
104935,"poor course, saturated, with an instructer that uses big words and does not explain many difficult ideas, and take for granted that the leaner knows a lot of probability and statistics.",1
104936,this is awesome,5
104937,"Many videos lacked associated pdf slides so confusing to watch. Some topics on slides were not covered in videos. A supplemental video for those would be great even of optional.Brian Cato is a good presenter, however, more examples needed to be done showing how to work out various statistical problems both by traditional method and using R.",1
104938,There are better courses on the subject on coursera and other platforms. It worth it pursuing it if you are interested in joining the capstone project.,2
104939,"The material in the class is solid, but is poorly described. These are the foundations of statistical analysis, and unfortunately there's a lot of statistics jargon that students aren't going to be familiar with in here.",3
104940,it gives an idea of how one is prepared to ingress to Data Science. Isee that I need to review it more carefully later on.,3
104941,"The worst professor in this specialization. The subject really interesting, and I have been studying for a while in my Master's and PhD in engineering, so I could understand the bulk of the course. This is a very important subject in data analysis and these poor explained classes could make lot of people give up the specialization. Statistics involves much of mathematics and calculus which make it a natural challenge for most of the people. Please, improve these classes in order not to disappoint the student who want to become data scientists.",1
104942,Good refresher course. It'd be a little steep of a learning curve for someone new to hypothesis testing/confidence intervals in four weeks.,4
104943,This course gives a really good overview in statistical Inference.,5
104944,Very useful course! Depending on your background you may have to span it over two sessions.,5
104945,very difficult with lots of math not properly explained. What's the point of learned all these formulas by heart if you cannot use the properly because that is not explained well.,3
104946,"This is 3rd time I a trying this course. Labeling someone just reading the slides out loud as a course is ridiculous. I have to express that this is horrible, Please don't callout a course. Call it Audio Slides.I have a Master's degree in engineering and have won scholarship all my life. This is the first time I am trying out on-line course. The courses were okay till I came to this sections mostly done by Brian Jaffe. Knowing and teaching is two different things, Brian! I will continue, with help from other materials outside the course. But I have ti rate this as 1 star.",1
104947,"At times the content can be confusing. Some points are clearly explained. ""Data Analysys Tools"" course is a good complement in order to understand the subject.",3
104948,"I learned so much from this course. Brian has an occasional irreverence and dry wit that keep things lively. I will say that I disagree with some of his interpretations, but this is OK!I would like to see some integration of type s errors, capture intervals, and all the other things the cool kids are doing nowadays.I am now taking Bayesian statistics online via Richard McElreath's course and this one does help a bit in understanding likelihood functions.",5
104949,"I get this course since I really want to learn on boosting. However, I think the course pace is too fast and should be include more 'non-greece symbol'. I have a background in biostatistic and epidemiology but I'm still having a hard time understanding lecture. I would say that this course is the most difficult among this specialization (practical machine learning is much easier than this). I bet many students will have a problem in this course since it's a 'beginner' level specialization.My suggestion is to 'slow down' , expand the lecture with more drawing/picture explanation, more r coding and get rid of those greece-symbol as much as possible.",2
104950,The course was very dry compared to the other courses I have taken. Though there was a lot to cover in the four weeks but this was not best way to do it. The course covers a lot of concepts in far too little a time span. It should have been spread into at-least two modules.,3
104951,I really wanted to learn this stuff. I have almost no background in statistics. But the lectures didn't cover stuff with enough rigor and repetition for me to pick up much.So I pretty much gamed the quizzes and project enough to get through the class. Rather disappointing.,1
104952,Taught very quickly and assumes a high degree of math fluency. Only take this if you are either very fluent in math already or have a significant amount of time to devote to understanding the material.,2
104953,"Very challenging and very valuable as a learning experience. I really liked it and fortunately I passed. I did think it was a bit too fast-paced in some places though. It is so much theoretical and mathematical stuff that it would have been all right to spend 2 months rather than 1, and learn a little bit more in-depth with a little more space for practice and assignments.",4
104954,Very good class to get a feel for statistics,4
104955,"I think the theory is too dense, but with a weak link with R. I understood better with swirl than with the videos. I'd suggest a more organized video with less draws and annotations. They confused me sometimes.",3
104956,"Perhaps I'm holding the video lectures to too high of a standard set by Roger Peng in previous courses, but the videos are difficult to follow. I can see the effort is clearly put in, but all the actions going on during the videos are distracting at times.",4
104957,"Have some duplicated video, and some swirl problems",4
104958,"This course, which is part of Data Science Specialization Course, which is a BEGINNER specialization, doesn't explain as it should to BEGINNERS. They try to explain, complex topics in 3 minutes ... If I didn't need the certificate, I would definitely not waste my time on this course. Youtube videos from khan academy or Brandon Foltz (Statistics 101) are much more valuable, you really get the topic and they are free. The professors didn't want to spend time preparing good material, from my point of view, the preparation is very poor.The course is more oriented to teach you to be a ""data monkey"". You know the code you need to write, but you don't get what are you doing ... Where do these formulas come from?",1
104959,"This is course is well written , the Lecturer notes are very handy and Swirl Lessons give us Hands on Experience in Practical Implementation.Thanks for the instructors",4
104960,"Homework, lectures, and the quiz are completely out of sync. Bayes rule is introduced and appears in the homework but no where else. Things appear on the quiz that aren't in the home work or lecture. This was put together from scraps of another lecture, but in an incoherent fashion. When Caffo tells the viewer that they'll need to use other resources, he wasn't kidding. I dropped this the first time when I kept introducing things that completely had not been introduced, took another stats class, then came back and aced it. I don't mind accelerated learning or using other resources, but there's guide for which concepts are needed and where coverage for them can be found. This leaves little recourse but to know stats already, or go learn it before taking this course. Otherwise you don't know enough to even go find the pieces you need. Incidentally, the dude who does the lectures for Khan Academy does a fantastic job and the lectures are a joy to watch, though some people might prefer something that moves less slowly and carefully and perhaps they would prefer something that glosses over the fundamental concepts more. If that's the case, I can't say enough good things about Biostatistical Analysis by Zar but thoroughly, logically categorizing statistical methods with short, clear examples, references to the original research, and building up one concept after another in logical order. The chapters are short, but the first 16 or so should give you a good enough foundation to deal with about any intro stats class. As it is, Caffo's presentation needs some serious testing and remodeling, but there's no indication that it'll match what Khan Academy did regardless of how much work goes in. At best, it's a bitter pill you can swallow if you already know the concepts.",1
104961,This was probably the most difficult and challenging course . Had to pull out my old stats books to remember most of it. Using R to do what we used to do with TI-83's was great!,4
104962,Maybe the instructor could illustrate more,4
104963,very nice course,5
104964,"I love your lectures so much, I understood much better than what it's used to be for statistics, it's funny as well, thank you.",5
104965,Excellent course with great didactic. Congratulations!,5
104966,Very usefull course. Congratulations!,5
104967,"Seeking out supplemental material is not only helpful, but necessary. This course does not provide a foundation of knowledge for inferential statistics so much as present several equations and functions and describe how one might use them.",1
104968,We need more examples on datasets.,4
104969,"I wish there was more R programming focus. I feel like there was a lot of theory, and then a blanket ""t.test will cover this"" treatment of implementation in R.",4
104970,"Good overview of the fundamentals, including how to avoid some common statistical fallacies.",5
104971,"I am left feeling this course needs work. I don't know if it's the pain of switching to the new platform or what, but the total lack of any support from the TA/instructor team is frustrating. Add to that the fact that Brian skips from slide to slide very quickly often not providing adequate explanations and you'll be re-watching the videos many times over.Several of the videos have blatant errors in them, like the fast that the fourth video of a week also contains the entire third video... again.Such things should not have passed a half decent QA test.More than anything this specialization should not be marketed as ""no previous experience needed"". You need to know some statistics. And by some, I mean do the whole thing on Khan Academy first.",2
104972,As someone who isn't from math background many of concepts thought in here weren't quiet clear or intuitive. Could use more details or pointers to reading materials to help understand the concepts better,3
104973,professors caffo and leek go way too fast and are completely monotonous. the examples they use assume we know basic stats when likely most of us are a bit rusty.,2
104974,"Since it is a very theoretical subject, trying to explain it without proofs and plenty of background is hard. But i feel like most of the course is just to memorize formulas without much explanation where they come from. A few examples are computing the expectation and mean of the average distribution and computing confidence intervals.",3
104975,"I found this to be a tough class and had to take it twice, but it was worth the effort. It's tough if you're new to statistics. Starts easy enough but make the time to read additional references, articles, and online videos outside the course.",4
104976,"Not one a statistics newbie should take, had to take it twice just to grasp 80%",3
104977,"In debth enough to go through concepts slowly, but high level enough to keep them applicable to different problem settings",5
104978,Great summary course on statistical inference.,5
104979,Great course. Worth every penny,5
104980,"The class needs to be more accessible especially for non statisticians, I learned more from khan academy which got me through this class than the class itself",2
104981,Definitely the best and most useful course of the Data Science Specialization!,5
104982,"I think you can get a lot from this course, but you have to deploy a reasonable amount of time to find for yourself more in depth concepts elsewhere",4
104983,"I like lesson, teacher on video don't quickly and easily explained.",5
104984,This is the worst course so far. This should be a 2 month course or the course descritpion should be changed to make sure you have some statistics knowledge.,2
104985,"This course goes on a very fast pace and simply does not have the charm of all the other courses in the specialization. I understand that a lot of content is covered within a month, but there should be supplementary course material available. Moreover, TAs should be more active on the forums. I have seen most of the questions just being discussed among the students. A little disappointed. Will probably have to watch all the material again to have confidence with it.",3
104986,I found this course really good introduction to statistical inference. I did find it quite challenging but I can go away from this course having a greater understanding of Statistical Inference,5
104987,"Brian Caffo is a brilliant mind. I am sure, but in a way for me it is difficult to follow. In parallel I checked out Khan Academy and it was easier to understand.",3
104988,The instructor is not very good when compared to the others that are involved in this specialization.,2
104989,"This is a great course taught by a clever teacher but...The content is presented in a very dry, not easy to grasp, manner. In several cases, I had to use external sources to understand the content and/or derive it by myself. When I finally understood the content I couldn't understand why it is presented in such a cryptic manner when the concepts are rather simple to grasp and the math not so advanced.Professor Caffo is a good communicator in some occasion (the module on Power for example was incredibly well communicated). But most of the time he just throw us some result without properly setting the context and concepts, as if it was understood that we already know most of what he is talking about. (Not the case!)I plan to make a document that follows the course module and fill in the missing piece of contextual information, derivations and concepts. But this takes a lot of time. If/when it will be completed, I will try to find a way to share it with future generation of students. Because, honestly, the content of this course is not so hard and shouldn't be!",3
104990,It was a good course especially for beginners like me. Though i would advice to continuously keep digging more about other packages also and also going through stack overflow for various hurdles encountered during doing programming assignment.I would recommend this course to everyone who wants to know about data analysis using R language in particular.,5
104991,"Very disappointed with how the transition from the old Coursera platform to the new platform has been handled: lots of instances of the ""see lecture X"" in the quizzes where the reference is now just wrong because the lectures got renumbered, an almost complete lack of community TA/mentors, and no explanations from anyone as to how the new platform works.Perhaps the worst of all has been the almost complete lack of acknowledgement of any problems from the folks at JHU. This feels like it's just been dumped on the students without any real testing or any appropriate resources to sort out any problems.",1
104992,Cant understand whats going on,1
104993,Explanations not clear and feels like he's reading rather than explaining things.Consecutive videos feel like they are disconnected. Videos stop in the middle of him talking something. Thank god for the swirl assignments which make things much clearer!Also the course proceed very fast not giving enough time to the concepts.,1
104994,"Even as a mathematician I found it super useful to participate this class. I have learned similar material in an undergrad course, but I forgot most of it. In fact this course is so much better than the undergrad course I took, because quizzes and the project help me to learn the material by practical exercises. I am really thankful for the Data Science team for this course and all the Data Science Specialization!",5
104995,Very effective review! but quizzes were not challenging enough to test the concepts taught in the class,5
104996,Very good reminder of mathematical statics which I had on studies.,5
104997,This is an excellent course for anyone who needs a better understanding of statistics and that includes all professions that deal with quantitative data. It helps you become a better citizen by helping you decide when something is mere chance and when mere chance would not explain the events.,5
104998,Dividing a week's contents into modules and adding a brief introduction at the beginning of each module makes the course much more clear. Students can also know what programming assignments (swirl) they should do every week. I appreciate those changes in the new class.,5
104999,It's great to know that halfway across the world other people think just like you and are trying to change the world for the best. Thank you for providing this opportunity =),5
105000,"Great professor, great class!",5
105001,"Pretty amazing. Highly recommendable. If your aim is to gain some insight about many diverse sciences (although many related to social sciences and humanities) you should take this course. The instructors are pretty amazing too, highly eloquent and experts of their respective fields. Happy learning. :)",5
105002,Very motivating,5
105003,"How to Change the World is a good introductory course to create awareness about some of the most important issues of our world nowadays. The lectures, leaded by Prof. Michael Roth, showcase interesting conversations with other experts about their attempts to make positive change in the world, and the weekly assignments are a good way for students to synthesise the learning of each week.As a downside, I found very little participation in the discussion forums. I would have liked to discuss more about the different topics of each week. Also, the lectures, while interesting, were sometimes a bit long-winded, and I did not like the fact that some conversations were divided over several videos.In general, I have enjoyed the course and doing the assignments, and also reading and reviewing my peers' work. I would suggest re-editing the video lectures in a bit more synthesised and self-contained pieces, and perhaps to spice up the discussion forums with some initial threads by the moderators.Finally, I would like to say thanks to Prof. Michael Roth for its incredible effort in bringing together all the guest speakers and for making available this course for everyone in the world.Miguel R. C.",4
105004,Amazing course,5
105005,"Very good and interesting course. The assignments could have been a little more difficult for me, but it was good tht they made you think about how you can improve yourself and how you can help others. Also reading each others assignments was really helpful and inspiring.",4
105006,Heavy contents.. Unable to cover a week's material in a week,1
105007,This was a fascinating and thought-provoking course. Could there be a further one?,5
105008,An inspiring course. It brings me a view from social engagement point for building a better society :)),5
105009,Michael Roth is an extraordinary profesor.,5
105010,"The evaluations instructions some times are a little vague, but the material is very helpful. Thank you!",5
105011,Another great course 2nd best after managing an agile team. Great content and presenters with useful recommendations.,4
105012,"It wasn't easy to understand the practices of software development in this course. Please try to explain a little close, how software devs actually work.",3
105013,"Provides a lot of good insight on getting new code to production in a fast, high quality manner. The course has help me focus on the deployment pipeline.",5
105014,Compared to the first three courses in this specialization this course is very unstructured. The video's almost seem to scheduled randomly and a thread stringing everything together in a logical and purposeful way is completely missing. Learning anything from this course - at least for me - is very hard.,2
105015,Get ready for a lot of frustration and independent research. For being able to complete the course on continuous delivery the videos of the course are not a great help.,1
105016,Great course!,4
105017,Valuable experience. Well composed. Not designed for Sales and Product Managers though.,4
105018,The last assignment is hard to do if you have just pretend project not real one. But whole course is really good.,4
105019,"This course is not meant to stand alone as a single course, rather is a portion of a larger Agile Development course. I'm sure the information included is very informative, but it references information that was included in other courses. The first lessons start with diagrams that are not explained and terms that are not defined (which I presume were probably covered in the first course). Also plenty of references to information from other courses (""Previously we learned"" ""Remember the example"").Dropped the course, not that I didn't understand it, but rather it was not worth my time to play ""catch-up"" on my own. Suggest removing this course as a free-standing course, or revising to allow the data/lectures to stand on their own.",2
105020,"Excellent course. Outstanding presentation in a lively and engaging style. The material is explained very clearly and in good detail, with frequent reminders of previous items when relevant. Also benefits from humourous and diverting practical demonstrations of physical & chemical effects. Only shortcoming in my view is that the homework grading is only available if you stump up the fee of £39.",5
105021,Its really a great course.,5
105022,Very well taught,5
105023,Excellent course. Highly recommended if the subject is of interest to you.,5
105024,"Chris Cramer is a great speaker who clearly put a lot of care into how this material was presented. I have taken physical chemistry in my undergrad education and did well in it, but still learned a lot from the ~4 weeks of this course I actually did last time. By using base theoretical principles to motivate the thermodynamic principles, I got a different way to think about things I was familiar with and gave me a more intuitive understanding for certain things.",5
105025,I really enjoyed this course! The lectures were entertaining and fun.,5
105026,I study this course still.,4
105027,Prof Cramer communicates complex principles uniquely and with a twist of humor...,5
105028,Very basic and clear,5
105029,"A very thorough and clear coverage of thermodynamics and gas behavior. The lectures are very well-produced, accessible, and paced nearly perfectly. Great demonstrations, humor, and history keep the material relevant and exciting. Would highly recommend to physicists, chemists, and engineers of all backgrounds!",5
105030,Excellent content. Organized and challenging.,5
105031,"This is easily the best introductory statistical mechanics course on-line. Prof. Cramer presents the fundamental concepts of statistical mechanics in a sensible manner which makes this difficult subject somewhat manegable even for beginners. People with former experience with statistical mechanics will, on the other hand, benefit from the inclusion of the more involved connections to quantum mechanics and physical chemistry. I also highly recommend the mentioned youtube courses on some advanced topics.",5
105032,This course is very special. It has a formal math development but is clear with very nice exemples.,5
105033,Excellent intro to statistical molecular thermodynamics.,5
105034,Very good cours!,5
105035,The only thing that this course needs is more consistency/clarity using the constant with regards to state variables.,4
105036,"I took the course when it was first offered in 2013, and found it to be one of the best organized, most clearly presented on-line courses that I have seen. I recently re-enrolled in order to review, and was pleasantly surprised to see that the professor has made some follow-on lectures available on Youtube. I hope that this additional material will eventually be the basis for another course.",5
105037,Some of the best lectures I've ever seen. They manage to present difficult and subtle material in a clear manner. Exercises were good too. I learned a lot! Thanks from Norway :),5

And I'll be checking back to see if the Prof appears in something else.",4

105105,was insighful,5
105106,"This course is very interesting, and everything is there should be known to start a business.But basically, it just says to respect everyone and everything. This course lacks some content.

Having done an MBA in business I as expecting more in-depth teaching on strategies of various business and how their creation of value to stakeholders.The course is short and very appropriate for beginners but not in-depth knowledge, however it still does create valid points on businesses role towards society at large.Lastly I did like that all course material for all weeks were opened and thus one could progress through the course faster",3
105120,Excellent and very interesting. Now a lot of work to do to change to the New Models Of Business In Society. Thanks for sharing your knowledge.,5
105121,I took this course as something that would give me some additional knowledge on business and it got me looking into the sources and main themes the instructor talks about more. I have so far come away more informed than what I was expecting for sure. Highly recommend it,4
105122,Great stuff! I always thought about this and tried to do business this way. Now I am glad to find out that actually many people and smart people do the same. I am so glad! I really recommend you this short and interesting course!,5

105127,Simply brilliant course - I learnt so many beautiful concepts like Conscious Capitalism.,5
105128,Great course based on lectures and your own considerations. The course focus on old and new model of business and its impact on the society.

After the course you get the idea of corporate social responsibility (not only in big companies) and how it may create value.,5
105129,"Great and inspirational course. Thank you Prof Freeman for your approach that is making us think, reflect and question the current models of businesses in our societies!",4
105130,I loved it!,5
105131,"The content shown in the video lectures is a very nice overview of the subject but it feels somehow superficial, some more depth would be really appreciated.",4

105143,"Great course, enthusiatic teacher! The ideas were new to me and are much more sustainable than what is currently thaught in colleges/ unis.",5
105144,Very good course. I am enjoying it immensely.,5
105145,AMAZING CLASS! LEARNED ALOT!,5
105146,"I loved this class. The instructors were so gentle, articulate, and specific with their advice, and the instruction was excellent. I'd love to take it again and again. It did a lot for me as a writer personally, and I enjoyed seeing what other writers were doing. Highly recommend!",5
105147,"This specialization was outstanding. It unveiled so many of the mysteries of creative writing that I've puzzled over for a long time. My skills are unquestionably improved. In addition, the courses guide you on the practice of writing. How important it is to make it a social aspect of your life and not write in isolation since that often leads to losing momentum. Joining a writer's group and/or attending writer's conferences and workshops are key elements in keeping up the writing and getting better. The professors and guest speakers for this specialization were fantastic. Can't say enough positive things about it - this specialization exceeded my expectations.",5
105148,I enjoyed the course very much. The critiques were the most important part and that is where this course fell down. I only received two instead of the expected three critiques for the sanding and final critique assignments.,4
105149,"The entire 5 module experience was wonderful, enjoyable, stressful (in a good way), inspirational and encouraging. The Professors, the readings, the assignments coupled with the peer reviews made this online experience as close to a real classroom experience as I had hoped it would be. The course gave me the tools needed to keep going myself, as well as tools for reading generally, in a more critical way and, editing tips which are always, invaluable. I looked forward to each new week for the structure and, for seeing what would be required of me for that particular week's assignment and, most weeks, I surprised myself with what I did write. I am sorry that the course is over but I have taken away so much! Thank you.",5
105150,I really enjoyed this specialization course from the University of Wesleyan. All mentors and guests were providing very valuable and helpful information for the beginner writers and course participants. I mastered some skill which will be very useful for me during my creative writing career and that is why I want to declare my deep thankfulness to all member of this team who made such a great specialization and Capstone project.,5
105151,Really fun and a course I used on my first two books which will be published at amazon this month.,5
105152,"I must say that the information on writing in the course was good, and the example of sanding, giving a critique etc. was very useful to me as a writer just putting her work into the world. I was extremely disappointed that after laboring through 3 long stories, only one formatted in the way the course specified, and trying to write at least one page of comments on each that what I got in return was on good critique and two that were only two lines long. I was on scholarship so I did not pay for the course but it was disappointing that there was no moderation of the peer review side of the homework.",3
105153,This is a great series. Stay with it all the way through!,5
105154,"I learned a lot from the exercises in the other parts of the specialization. To make the capstone a better experience for everyone I propose that here the reviews should be graded. Perhaps, only have each person do two reviews instead of three but have them submitted as part of the next week's assignment and rated. Everyone could rate two or three reviews. This way reviewers would put in as much effort into the reviews as into their submissions, and they would also learn how to write reviews by reading other reviews and sanding examples.",3
105155,I enjoyed the time spent on the specialization and felt that the lesson exercises provided some use towards helping students develop their understanding of the craft. My only real criticism about the specialization is that I feel the curriculum could be a little more intensive. Keeping most assignments limited to a 500 word maximum is very constricting. I wish there were more meatier assignments to tackle building up to the capstone.,4
105156,A great process for any writer.,5
105157,"Really enjoyed doing the capstone project! It was difficult at times, but totally worth it in the end!",5
105158,"The most important part of this course is peer review IMHO. So, I put a lot of effort and consideration into the reviews I gave, trying to make them helpful, constructive and encouraging. But it was not very reciprocal. I DID get a few great reviews, very thoughtful, very constructive. But sometimes I only got two reviews instead of three, and usually the reviews gave no criticism. One review was a single word, ""nice."" I got a LOT more out of the other courses in this certificate. I was disappointed with this one.",2
105159,"This course has been one of the best writing course that I have ever taken. I tell all of my writing friends that they should take the course, even if it's just for a refresher. The instructors were very clear on the assignments, the course were well planned. I hated for it to end. I would be very interested in a more in depth course on fiction if there is such a thing.",5
105160,"Sorry but the variable ""peer"" reviews ruined this course for me, I either did not get enough reviews or a ""prankster"" would down mark for whatever reason they had in their head at that particular moment. the staff don't seem interested in this a a problem. and there is no way to rate a bad reviewer so they get away with it.the other courses in the specialisation are great, but this one gives very little in the way of tuition and relies on the whole on peers, which for me didn't work out too well",1
105161,You will get what you bring to the table - if you're an avid reader and have the smarts - you'll learn a LOT. Take note of the various books being recommended and read those too. Some of your classmates may not be producing the best work - don't worry - you do YOU and learn at your best level. It really helped me breakdown the basics of Writing and I now read books with a new eye. A new understanding of the art being disseminated. A wonderful course. Well designed.,5
105162,"The only reason this excellent course does not have five stars is because of the technical issues that are the responsibility of Coursera and the failure of some of the peers to write peer reviews according to the instructions. I heartily recommend this course to anyone seeking to kick start, revive, or tune up serious writing.",4
105163,It was a great course. I learned a lot. It's just sad that some people don't understand how hard it is to write in another language.,5
105164,"I have enjoyed every second of the five-part creative writing specialization. These courses have made me reassess my writing practices, they have allowed me to hone my skills as both a writer and working on the editing process. The course materials were brilliantly developed to support the aspiring writer and the knowledge and writing tips are of a very high caliber.Each guest writer and tutor have given great insight into the writing process and how every writer is different, everybody has their own methods of working. Superb and challenging.",5
105165,"There are a lot of kinks to be worked out in this course. The teaching aspect of the Craft of Writing is in the four previous courses, this one is basically write a story, get reviews.",2
105166,"This course is good, but I want English or Korean subtitles.",4
105167,GREAT SIR..I LEARN IT SO PERFECTLY,4
105168,The course was good!,4
105169,The course was very interesting and helpful! I learned a lot and the presented techniques are very helpful in all kinds of different projects!,5
105170,Great course!,5
105171,Great course!!,5
105172,Great exploration of narrative. Would be nice to see more examples and techniques for turning narrative into gameplay.,5
105173,"This is a very interesting course to learn the essentials of creating characters and stories that are captivating for the players, and how to ensure that your story works as a game. I really liked the assignement marked by peers.",5
105174,"Good experience to know about narrative for video games, very inspiring.",5
105175,This is a great course! Very strong teacher and useful material. It's cool that you used in course for cases blizzard game Starcraft 2. I like it.,5
105176,"Lovely course, lovely teacher and lovely materials.",5
105177,A great way for understanding connections with players!,5
105178,This 4 weeks were very educational. I got a chance to learn new and exciting stuff. Thank you very much for this experience,5
105179,"Well the course helped me to learn and practice how to develop a couple of characters briefly in order to start writting a story. It teaches a good scheme to follow and a method to achieve it succesfully.What I lack most from this courses in Coursera is to receive more feedback, specially feedback from people who has some advanced knowledge in the field, like the teacher. I wouldn't mind to pay the course if I would have this kind of speciallized feedback, but so far I am happy with the free version of the course.",5
105180,"I appreciate knowing more now than I did before about story writing. I know better now how to approach assessing a story and critiquing it, and I really want to work on a story of my own next!Not going to lie, though, this course was difficult to immerse myself in simply because of the examples: I'm not into guns, not into muscle, not into violence, and every single example was either of men, or how a female's mission centered around the men in her life. If I could suggest a change in this course, it would be to consider all the different backgrounds of the people taking the course, and give examples that are more inclusive.",3
105181,This course helped me a lot in polishing my plot for the game. It is must course. Enjoyed ever lessen and enjoyed doing the assignments.,5
105182,"It's great, I want more example and analysis in today's different kinds of games,plz.",5
105183,It was a great course and I`ve learned a lot with him!I recommend for all student who want to get start on game design area.,4
105184,"Once upon a time, Calarts was my grad school, and I got the MFA gladly. Years later, I needed to up my skills, and I discovered Coursera had many of the classes I wanted to take-- and now I feel like my MFA is an MFA+. This course is very good for both the writer and the game maker- and more to the point- it is a great breakdown of what is a good storytelling device. Highly recommended.",5
105185,"Concepts are interesting, the assignments are not. Writing and re-writing about the teacher's generic game example. Not much opportunity to work on your own content.",3
105186,Great course. It has helped me a lot to develop the story of my game.,5
105187,"I don't feel like I learned a whole lot, there wasn't a lot of new information presented.",2
105188,"Fun stretching writing skills, would be good if more game-like nuances were added.",5
105189,"I feel that the course was great but I felt confused on the last assignment, we covered a lot of things during the last week but then I was unsure if I should've applied that on our assignment... Also I'm not sure if it is possible but if we could have a chance to ask the teacher questions would be great. I know that there is a lot of people going this courses and maybe it is not possible but still there are things that I feel only the teacher could answer. Overall the course was good :)",4
105190,"Awesome experience, and really useful, well-packed, and valuable insight into story and narrative development for video games. Thanks!",5
105191,Pretty informative and helpful. Especially if you have difficulties in creating a plot for you game.,5
105192,"A nice course, but there is lack of teachers participation.",4
105193,Pretty cool,5
105194,It is so engaging! I love the assignments and the way knowledge is transmitted. Thank you. :),5
105195,"Course materials are a little bit obvious, but I really like the original version of The Shooter and Jane's personality",4
105196,I enjoyed it! Quite simple but still usefull and interesting.,5
105197,"Great course, really comprehensive!",5
105198,"Loved the lecturer, he gave me so many good ideas. Learned a lot from this course.",5
105199,Enjoyable content and presentation but the coarse seemed very short compared to others I've taken. Not a criticism but rather and observation. If it was short on purpose that is one thing but I believe there is more to be said on this topic fundamentally and hope to see this course expanded or a second one produced.I would like to that those involved int its creation.,4
105200,"The course is fun, but as the previous part of the specialization a bit simple for what it charges for the certificate.",4
105201,"The material is OK, but it just felt so boring",3
105202,Great teacher and interesting topics. A great starter on how to develop stories for games.,5
105203,Awesome course! I learned a lot!,5
105204,Makes you think. Interesting for any developer or anyone intested in narratives as a whole. Really nice exercises and lists too!,4
105205,"Great course, excietd :)",5
105206,explanation nuts and bolts,5
105207,"I liked the course. To improve, could become more dynamic , but the teacher is to be congratulated .",4
105208,A lot of work writing but the quality of instruction is excellent.,5
105209,I learned a lot from this course,5
105210,I learned good stuff. i gave four star because there could be more content some parts were written instead of a lecture. But i will recommend this course.,4
105211,"Great material and wisdom, really makes you think in the real importance of a well written story in a game.",5
105212,"I found that the portion of the class that taught story-telling was painfully over simplified. I learned nothing and felt no challenge whatsoever, in fact, I felt as though I was rehashing information from a 9th grade English class (no hyperbole). The other component of this class was learning how to create documents that you could use to pitch your game to developers. I found this component to be useful, but it could have easily been compressed into a single week if not a single lecture. There is no real accountability when it comes to grading work, as work is peer graded and students grade capriciously without regard for the criteria laid out in the lecture. In other words, most students responded to how cool or interesting they found my assignments, without regard for the weekly lecture or the grading criteria. It often felt as though the lectures didn't matter at all. Right when the class begins to introduce a more robust tour of laying out a game story, it suddenly ends. This class is only useful to students who are interested in an area of game design besides writing and who are taking the whole series anyway. If you are seriously interested in writing, this class will have little value for you and I would recommend skipping it.",2
105213,Excellent course.Congratulations!!!It will be very useful to me,5
105214,"I am enjoying this course a lot. As a storyteller with screenwriting experience, it is interesting to learn of how the story dynamics work in the world of Game Design. Dariush is an engaging teacher and he provides a lot of good material to work with, as well as references.",5
105215,"It very interesting and cool course, thank you very much!!",5
105216,Great course and great teacher,5
105217,"The mentor is really good, he is great at explaining what he means and gives you a few great methods for writing. The peers were also great.",5
105218,I am glad that I have chosen to sign up to this course. It has open up my vision to a whole new world. Thanks so very much. The professor is engaging and the course content is fascinating.,5
105219,This course gives actionable ideas about design characters and story lines.,4
105220,"It was not easy, I admit... but it was an awesome course, after this one i finished the four courses and I'm totally happy with everything I learned!!!",5
105221,"The course develops skills in communicating video game narratives and weaving these into the overall structure of the game. The strategy hinges on a series of outlines--taught with examples and exercises--that eventually fit together in a comprehensive design document, which allows a designer/writer to organize ideas and make them comprehensible and engaging for potential readers. The examples used are great, covering games both simple and complex; and the exercises grow gradually less structured, ensuring that the skills necessary to develop an idea from scratch are gained along the way.",5
105222,"It's pretty good, but it has some things I perceive to be flaws. First of all, this course is entirely about writing a narrative for a game. It uses the examples of Starcraft 2 and Angry Birds. Neither of those games are particularly known for their narrative, but he uses Starcraft 2 as a more heavy narrative example and Angry Birds as a light narrative example. He goes on to talk about how adding implicit narrative elements help engage the player by exploiting their emotions, etc. etc. I don't find these examples to be particularly engaging - especially the cynical cash-grab that is Angry Birds.",4
105223,"Such a boring course. No challenge at all, no meaningful example, and in the end seems that everybody grade without any reason. I don't think I'll finish the specialization, it's too expensive for such a poor quality",2
105224,"This was an excellent course, and gives a lot of insight and techniques to develop a good and intriguing story. What I liked the most was how the story would be implemented with the gameplay. I recommend this course to anyone that doesn't know how exactly to develop a good story, or is starting with VG design.",5
105225,This Course helped me a whole lot in process of writing and how to break down the process for better performance. I really liked how easy and well sorted were the Content of the course and how the assignment was purposely designed for that week.,5
105226,"Very good method of passing the knoledge and valuable material and tecnics to start or develop your writing skills, great course, love it!",5
105227,Perfect!,5
105228,"This course is amazing for everyone who wants to learn more about story writing and presenting it, which than can be used for video games, but also for anything else as well.Great course, my best recommendations.",5
105229,I loved it.,5
105230,"Very exciting course, it encourages creativity and helps bring structure to game ideas.",5
105231,"I enjoyed the peer reviews and how the lecturer conveyed clearly how to express our thoughts to paper, or should i say screen. Great work !",5
105232,"This course is really interesting and fun, also absolutely understandable and easy to follow. Thank you a lot!",5
105233,Perfect!!,5
105234,Great! Very Well Structured,5
105235,Amazing...A great teacher that will provide a valuable insight of the topic!! A must-do course! :),5
105236,This is my favorite course ever. Dariush teaches in such an engaging way and it shows you how to have a creative yet objective and analyzed mindset for creating a story and narrative for a Video Game.,5
105237,"Very easy to follow and quite useful, not only for games but for designing user experiences because it focuses on how to engage people.",5
105238,"The course is ok, but it doesn't give any certificate of completition for free users (something that many other courses do give).",3
105239,Very important in develop of videogames,5
105240,Extremely helpful to get an introductory idea on how to use narrative in video games,5
105241,"Big fan of the last two assignments. Re-writing the game was fun, and made it more interactive with the rest of the class, seeing how others would change the story.",5
105242,Great and easy to learn!,5
105243,This course is pretty cool. I actually learned a lot about analyzing narratives and writing that I hadn't really considered before... It's totally worth it.,5
105244,"Fun, interesting, good pacing and case studies. Instructor was enthusiastic, knowledgeable and presented material well.",4
105245,The course has a nice introduction and depth to the story and narrative elements of a game (and other media).,5
105246,"The content is good but is too focus in the 3 act structure, and don't explain the narration techniques specifically to videogames genres. The assignments were too repetitives and don't add variety or feeling of progression through the course. I recommend the course for who don't know the basis of the narrative structure, but not for people like me who work in the audiovisual world.",2
105247,"Assignments are good-intended, but I am not sure how helpful they are, as they are really boring and unnecessarily time-consuming. I do not know how could one make them better. In contrast, the videos are really good, they are worth your time even if you know your way around these things.",4
105248,"This is a good course for both who is starting as for those who already have a knowledge and seek advice and new ideas to develop stories for games.However, I think that is ideal for everyone who wanted to learn how to communicate for team the idea of the game.",5
105249,I think I have grown a lot from this course. I congratulate the entire team and Teachers.,5
105250,A very interesting course about a subject that is probably overlooked by many gamers in favour of fun.A compelling story (as well as memorable music and striking graphics) is what makes games an art form.,5
105251,"The contents were comprehensive, and the assignments helped reinforce the theory. By using pre-existing references to other works, they were tighter, which I think is useful to focus on the objectives set for a particular week. Some additional creative freedom would also have been interesting.",4
105252,"I really enjoyed this course, The only thing I would have liked to have learned more about was how to do Game Design Documents and how they are made. I would have liked to have seen more examples as well as how to do these examples as well.Thank you, I learned a lot.Sarah Prewitt",4
105253,Good overview of narrative and a breakdown of key story elements such as character and setting.,3
105254,Very good course that explains the basics of videogame narrative.,5
105255,Really nice way to know hot to present a Story!,4
105256,"Although its very writing-intensive, I learned a lot from it and feel much more able to develop a story for a game. Thanks!",5
105257,"The instructor carefully illustrates all points necessary for wring a game story. The logic is extremely clear, course materials intact and homework amount is decent for students.",5
105258,Great course. Help to improve your skills of creating goo story for the game.,5
105259,"It is more interesting course that I thought it to be, and the teacher, Dariush Derakhshani, is a very clever and charismatic person. He makes the student thinks for themselves, and the interesting assignments help them to foster their creative abilities.",5
105260,The basics of this course are well defined and prepare you for proper story and narrative development in video games. I like the step-by-step process this course takes.,5
105261,"The course topic are well explain and easy to understand, the videos are well directed, and the creative exercises are pretty cool.",5
105262,Amazing fun and useful!,5
105263,"I was pretty upset by finding out there will be no Fran at this course, but Dariush is an amazing teacher too! I love how the material presents and exercises and examples are very interesting! 5 stars, no doubts!",5
105264,Thanks for the course. It was business oriented and very practical. It really added to the business analytics approach I was looking for.,5
105265,Arguments brought up are shallow,3
105266,Very informative and logically consistent. Great way to get to know R.Very useful for wanna-be consultants),5
105267,"It does allow the purchase of a specific course within the specialization, the student has to subscribe to the all specialization even if they are only interested in one course only. Secondly the owner of this course should have allowed at the assignment to be submitted, because some people purchase a course only right after they have completed it.",1
105268,"quite helpful to have enter into the field, recitals were really useful.",5
105269,"Very useful, practical anda easy to follow.",5
105270,"Great course! I believe it would be a good idea to have the text beside the videos, not below. Also, one thing that was difficult for me was the pre-process of the data (handling NA's). I believe that you should suggest some methods for that and what is the right way to do. Thank you!Best regards,Evgenia Rodopoulou",5
105271,very rich and valuable course !,5
105272,"Practical skills taught for how to use data tool for business purpose. It is exactly what i am looking for!If you do not know anything about R, it is suggestible to take basic R language course before enrolling in this one.I myself was a newbie in data field, but I took several courses of ""Data Science"" by John Hopkins University before starting this one. I am delighted to find that the coding thing I learned would finally have a role to play in possible future career.",5
105273,Really worth it.,5
105274,Nice and helpful course,4
105275,"Lectures and Recitals were good, easy to understand. Discussion forum was a deserted place with little sharing. Would be nice to have a more open community. Overall, pretty good. Looking forward to the next courses.",3
105276,Its OK,5
105277,"The course covers a great deal of content, which is very relevant to day to day business context.However, the course instructors can certainly do a better job on providing clear instructions on Projects and phrasing of Quiz questions. Some of the phrasing of questions/deliverables can be confusing and often requires rigorous deciphering.",4
105278,"This gave me a great insight, and give me the will to learn and become an exeprt in R programming",5
105279,"This course does well to balance its focus on strategy and analytics. The analytics aren't overly in-depth, allowing for less technical individuals to reap benefits from the course. I highly recommend this course to consultants and business analysts.",5
105280,It give me a new way of science analytics to know the business better,5
105281,"Started in middle of everything, its course covers 5 to 7 factor samples, in the final exam the minimum factors is 70 or more!You not will learn R, not really business insights, but you learn some specific cases.I think you will learn lots of betters course in this site.",1
105282,"I am only at Week 2 so far, but the techniques presented in this course, enhanced by the quality of the recitals (which walk you through the R-code application of the concepts presented) are very relevant to the subject matter.I would not recommend taking this course without a decent background in R; however, the recitals do a good job at helping even beginners understand the application of statistical models to business decisions.",5
105283,Great!,5
105284,"Much trivial content, but advertised as an expert course. Further, the assignments did not work properly at the beginning and there is no timely response of staff. I would not waste money on that course again and will probably try to get refund in time.",1
105285,"This course is great, but I would NOT pay for the specialization.",4
105286,"Great course which uses R to have you do classification, linear and logistic regression to address business topics.",5
105287,"Great course! Of course, french accent, but gently.",5
105288,Awesome course.,5
105289,"Very interesting and insightful, it gave me tools and concepts which I can apply in my job.",5
105290,"English is horrible, and I am french...",1
105291,Very complete and usefull,5
105292,"I enjoyed this class, but the content feels amateurish. One major detracting factor is grading of the exams- a complete waste of time where there are multiple examples of contradictory slides to the quiz questions. The quizes often ask for information that is beyond the scope of the lectures and steadily becomes a process of just retaking exams until you get a 100%. I don't think the quizes reinforced the material in the lecture but actually took away from the class. This class was at it's best during the recitals, where I actually got to understand the great strategies used in the videos.",5
105293,Thoughtful and practical !,4
105294,The better course I have ever realized on Coursera. Theorycally strong and truely applicable.,5
105295,I wish this course was for free with the assignments!,1
105296,The final course assignment was not defined precisely enough which led to varying interpretations among graders and reduces grades for all as a result.Otherwise a good intro course for the analytics specialization that focuses on the managerial aspects of data analytics and the communication of results.I wish that links to supplementary reading on the statistics used in the course would be provided.,4
105297,I like Professor Glady's style of minimalism in lectures but stressing the end goal of the analytics. IT was an interestingly presented and fairly engaging course. Assignments could be more difficult to encourage deeper learning of the hands-on analytic crunching.,4
105298,It's a great course,5
105299,Really good course - learned a lot. The approach was very friendly with guided exercises and code walk-throughs.,5
105300,Great course. The level of R needed to complete the course is very basic and a person having no prior knowledge in R could do it with some difficulty.,5
105301,Wonderful course.,5
105302,"Great course on topic of strategic business analytics. However, it would have been better if there were more readings and examples shown to understand the concepts better.",4
105303,A truly fabulous MOOC. Granted you have to be proficient in R and have an understanding of business practices for maximum benefit but it is well worth gaining such skills just to take this course - you won't regret it.,5
105304,Poor presentation. Unclear points. Not a detailed walk through about the specific tool.,2
105305,Great course. well presented,4
105306,Very well structured. Useful scripts and recitals!,5
105307,"Very relevant courseTeaches the interpretations of advanced analytic techniques - has a nice balance between the communications and the hard technical aspect. Would recommend it. However, for those who are not already familiar with the hard technical aspect, the course may be daunting.",5
105308,Absolutely outstanding course. I have thoroughly enjoyed the blending of technical methodology and business necessity of the analyses demonstrated.,5
105309,They do it easy,4
105310,"Not very like this course... especially those videos are introduced by female speaker....we dont have this kind of software, can't understand and practice it....",2
105311,This course is excellent when it provides the citations very fit to theory. And I learned it in well organized structure of knowledge. Thank Prof. Glady and his team very much.,5
105312,"Good foundations course, some basic working knowledge of R is required so i would recommend that you are able to use the software. Statistical basics is also important to grasp the work.",4
105313,Learning a lot from this course! The instructor addressed real business case scenarios and delivered everything that was stated in the course objectives. Both the style and the content were well balanced in terms of strategic business issues and tools to address those.,5
105314,good course. Can focus more on practical aspects,4
105315,I thnik the course is very interested and very good organized and you learn some interesting things.Prior exposure with R is neccesary and in my opinion if in the assignements existed some more questions in order to spent more time in R the course would have been even better..,4
105316,"A good course, its just a little bit too short based on the content it wants us to focus. The chapter on presenting our information is funny because the slides presented contain every anti-pattern that they want us to avoid. Apart from that, a great course.",4
105317,Fantastic examples of applied data analysis,5
105318,Really nice,5
105319,"Interesting and industry-insightful curriculum, contains some detail technicality like use of R programming language but provides hands-on video guidance to help student catch on the technicality.",4
105320,Awesome Course,5
105321,Fantastic course. THis allow you to become an strategic business analytics consultant,5
105322,The only problem was the lack of Portuguese/English subtitles.,4
105323,pretty good,5
105324,"Really interesting and useful. The modules covers a wide range of subjects regarding ethics, law and strategy issues. You can get tips and skills to put into practice in",5
105325,"Heads and Shoulders above typical online ... blah blah (Im teaching because I can't do anything else productive in the world). Prof. Seidel is a top notch, world class down to the roots, model instructor.You won't find better instruction than this class ... anywhere, at any dollar amount.Don Hall, N.D./N.M.D.",5
105326,It is a amazing course about a fundamental structure of every business (or even making personal decision).,5
105327,"a concise look at managing a business through a successful process of Three Pillars, balancing strategy, legal and ethical concerns in an organization",5
105328,"Both courses from this lector are very useful and beneficial, strongly recommend. At 2 of the weeks in this one he uses videos from the other course, so maybe you want to pass it first and safe time here later.",5
105329,"excellent course, particularly enjoyed the IP Section!",5
105330,Very interesting and useful course!,5
105331,"Unfortunately, ""Strategy pillar"" and ""Ethics pillar"" are observed in far less details than ""Law pillar"" here. Thus, this course is good mostly for people who are interested in American law basics.",3
105332,Great course for all and any chosen field of study.,5
105333,"This course is essential for executives without accounting or law as proficiencies in their portfolios. Taking this ""Three Pillar Model for Business Decisions: Strategy, Law & Ethics,"" prepare a manager to go about the business delivery with all those conceptual tools he needs to get his job done, running the business. As an IT and Music Analytics business person, I find this Coursera and Michigan University course offering essentially to making proper decisions. Problem I find though an excellent course is that the book: “ Three Pillar Models for Business Decisions: Strategy, Law & Ethics,” carries no INDEX that would help to pass the final exam quickly as time and effort is most important for us busy bodies. I could design a watch from this “Three Pillars . . . ,” course.",4
105334,"Mind blowing. Though i was somewhat aware of these aspects of Strategy, Law & Ethics, but were pleasantly enlightened by the course material that had organised my thoughts more clearly. Thanks a ton.",5
105335,"Bad learning experience. Materials were reasonable, but the slides for the course were not made available, no one answered questions on the discussion forums related to the course content and the only additional resources provided were to buy a book from the instructor...",2
105336,Excellent course. The examples and the way it is taught are amazing. Learning and enjoying guaranteed.,5
105337,Extremely informative course though the English subtitles for certain lectures were a bit confusing and the large number of peer-graded assignments were tedious to complete.,4
105338,I love this course because it gives a basic knowledge of Chinese medicine. It enhances my understanding towards the complex concepts.,5
105339,very interesting course！！！,5
105340,A wonderful course. I totally enjoyed it and have learned so much! Thank you!,5
105341,good course but not fully completed. Learned a lot about herbalism.,3
105342,"Good for understanding the philosophy of Chinese Herb concept. To maintain a good health, one should understand the external causes of disease (under Chinese concept) and then why and how our food and Chinese herb can adjust your internal balance back to healthy condition.",5

105344,A good way to learn chinese culture,5
105345,Good course,5
105346,Great course! Thanks a lot!,5
105347,Real good,5
105348,Highly recommend this course for beginners!,5
105349,Explanations are not always transparent.,4
105350,Everything is great! Sometimes lectures were apart from seminars and labs,5
105351,It is a great course for those who intersted in machine learning! I recomend it for everyone. Thank you for your efforts!,5
105352,Good intro,4
105353,"Nice course, thank you, authers!Chesalin Alexander",5
105354,"This is not an Introduction but a Review of Machine Learning methods used in Yandex.Probably, you have to multiply estimated required time by 10 to really understand lecture topics.Kaggle competition at the end makes the course really interesting.but:""A theory that you can't explain to a bartender is probably no damn good.""-- Ernest Rutherford",5
105355,Not bad for introduction in Machine Learning,4
105356,very little relationship between lectures and assignments. was expected more practices,3
105357,"Too complex lectures for novices, too easy assignments for experienced python programmers.",4

105368,"I find this course really helpfull, as it provides many resources. Also, it made me start planning ahead for my studies in Japan, which is essential. Also, I think having the advices of people that's living there in Japan, and had to go through the same process you will have to go was great. However, I expected the course to be a little more specific when explaining the process you have to follow to study in Japan, but I understand that it changes from one university to another one.",4
105369,great course for who want to know about Japan,5
105370,The couse was awesome! I was able to get to know more about studying at Japanese universities! Hope everyone who participated could go to Japan in the future!,5

105374,A very informative course for those who dreams about studying in Japanese universities.,5
105375,Hello thank you to you who had this idea because I found the course very instructive. I could learn a lot about the Japanese universities and somehow on the lifestyle of the Japanese. But what I wish most To the world is to be accepted in the university of tokyo.Thank you all that God bless you,5

105384,great course,5
105385,useful and detailed!,5
105386,its great and helpful,5
105387,"This course offered a lot of different information to many other students looking abroad. It gave a lot of different scenarios and ways to deal with them. Also it offered many different experiences students in Japan were having, and that was very helpful. However the way it presented the course work information was a little hard to work with on my computer",4
105388,Offers practical information on studying in Japan and why to study there in the first place,5
105389,I would really like to study in this course but I can't just pay the fee without knowing if it can help me or not.,5
105390,Interesting approach and good overview of the long history and development of the Western way of war.A bit of a gap between the long historical development lines up until WW2 and the the last lectures about more recent events.,5
105391,Really interesting course which allows for new insights.,5
105392,Its a wonderful course and shows the dynamics of war,5
105393,"Great toppic, nice optics",5
105394,This is one of my favorite courses I've taken. Its very interesting and I really enjoy the lectures.,5
105395,informative,5
105396,"Just brilliant. After this course you'll get a comprehensive idea of war, and of the society itself.",5
105397,"It's a extended introductory course. Very useful to first understanding about war, history and sociologycal issues related.",5
105398,"Fantastic course on war by a professor who is passionate, articulate, and very focused in his effort to provide primer material on such a wide and complex topic. Thanks very much for creating this course! I've learnt a ton.",5
105399,"I thoroughly enjoyed the course. I think I must have virtually done it on my own as there were no other interventions, certainly in recent weeks. A very thought provoking course and all credit to the Professor and those who helped him put the course together.",4
105400,Weekly quizzes would be great!,3
105401,An in-depth course on what war is!!!,5
105402,"I loved the elaborate structure, but they should provide a certificate",4
105403,"I appreciated the professor's clear and articulate lectures, together with the use of in-lecture questions to reinforce the main concepts.I may not completely agree with all of the points raised by the good professor, but the perspective he offered on historical events was greatly appreciated.I also appreciated that approaching the methods of war within different cultures would have required a much larger and longer course and so I am grateful to the professor for placing his focus where he did.It is unfortunate that my timing in participating in this class reduced my ability to properly interact with other students during the progress of the lessons, but I have to accept responsibility for that aspect.Still, I consider this to be one of the more exceptional courses offered by Coursera and credit that largely to the presentation skills of the good professor. I thank him for sharing his knowledge and this opportunity to consider a topic I would not ordinarily study in such detail.",4
105404,"detailed, easy to understand",5
105405,so far very interesting and masterfully explained,5
105406,"Great course! Good, clear and well structured lectures and interesting readings. Although much of the information in the course was not new to me, the course taught me several new viewpoints and that was really nice. Thank you for providing this course and for the effort!",5
105407,Great. Gives very interesting points of view and he enlightens interesting aspects.I like his style of presentationand and he is very good to understand. If he would do another project with Cousera - I would join.Thanks!,5
105408,A different perspective of war that made me think very differently about the whole process and the reactions of people involved in any form of confrontational situation,4
105409,"Paradoxes of War was maybe one of the most interesting course I've enrolled in Coursera.I can say for sure that I've learned a lot via Prof. Miguel Centeno through all those weeks. I admire him for his passion and his knowledge. I was really surprised to watch how many things he knows about Ancient Greek history and Mythology and most of all I was really pleased to listen to him using a great deal of ""hellenic vocabulary"". That amazed me!I would like to thank him personally about this course.I am looking forward to take another class of yours again in the future.Thank you!Elizabeth (Greece)",5
105410,Good coverage and interesting lectures that provides a good history of all the warfare and on the social psychology. A fresh perspective I guess.,4
105411,good curse,5
105412,"The title of this course is Paradoxes of War. One of the paradoxes is how little paradox there is in war, after reviewing and reflecting on the lectures and the reading materials.",1
105413,"This course is entirely riveting and imminently informative, timely, and important. Dr. Centeno is a wonderfully engaging instructor and he does an excellent job of discussing these often difficult, thorny issues with sensitivity, academic acuteness, and balance.",5
105414,One of the best academic experiences I had.As a soldier I would recomend it to my fellow soldiers and to my civillian friends so they could understand a little better the paradoxes of war.,5
105415,"This is an amazing and interesting course. I am really enjoying it, the explanations are clear.",5
105416,"Thank you for this brilliant insight about the nature of war. I am now ""20.000 leagues"" closer to understand the nature of war. In other words ""Aha!"". Sure, this course isn´t to replace real studies in sociology of warfare. Nevertheless: ""How can I know what I say, until I see what I say."" --- Thinking, speaking, acting --> makes us ethical blind or brings us to freedom and peace, changing everyday life in peace. Knowing to defend our planet, even to be in war with clashing ideology.",5
105417,Flexible Learning. Communicates directly to us. Intellectual.,5
105418,"It very interesting MOOC and quite unique of it's kind. It's good MOOC for everyone who want to get deep vision of history, it highlight and studies wars in a unique and very interesting way.",5
105419,Really good! Great teacher and very good structure and arguments.,5
105420,"Excellent course. I really enjoyed it! My most recent educational experience (I am 72 and a vet of the vietnam era) has been with the Great Courses from the Learning Company. This rates with the best of those many courses I have taken. I really appreciate the quizzes at the end of every lesson since they help to reinforce the key points (they also remind me of my college experience and the philosophy that every cadet will be graded in every class, everyday!)Kudos to the Prof!",5
105421,"Great lectures. The course material spans from ancient warfare and tactics all the way to modern wars that involve atomic bombs and guerrillas. He not only introduces us to the history of western warfare, but more importantly he focuses on the relationship of war and society -- on how wars arise from societal needs or conflicts as well as on how wars shape and transform society. He strikes a good balance between addressing the paradoxes of war and avoiding getting too much in politics and ideologies of war.",5
105422,Very interesting course,5
105423,Solid presentation of ideas that SHOULD be considered before entering a war -- but sadly are usually ignored in the emotions of a mindless mass moment.,4
105424,"Very well done. However, I disliked how the course itself and even the professor glorified positive aspects of war.",4
105425,A good course and very interesting perspectives. A pity Princeton does not issue certificates.,4
105426,Bring you into a world of art of war with much better interpretation than Sun Tzu and Machiavelli.,5
105427,A well structured programme that adds a more informed perspective to current events.,5
105428,Great teacher! Very interesting lessons and material.,5
105429,After almost a year I am still waiting to receive my grade of 90%+ for c,1
105430,"Although long-winded, it is a fantastic course w/fantastic insights!",4
105431,"Great Course, explores the war in its different facets.",4
105432,"A fresh perspective to see the relation between wars and our societies. The notion that wars are always bad and to be avoided is challenged, and seemingly controversial idea of wars bringing benefit to the societies (at a cost) is discussed, quite convincingly.",4
105433,"As a 24 yr military officer from a service academy I would like to complement the instructor......He is doing a great job, especially given no military service and direct experience in battle. I complement him.",5
105434,I did enjoining this program. Many thanks.,4
105435,"Well worth your time in hearing first hand from combat veterans. "" War What is it Good For?"" an excellent book that is thought provoking, it covers a lot of the material that is discussed throughout the course.",5
105436,"For an undergraduate course it's good - my only comment is on delivery - quotations given verbally might have been better if shown on screen to drive them home.I hope the professor will do a military history course that analyzes war more particularly now that we have the broad strokes. My interest is piqued from this course and I want to know more about specific wars/battles. I am also interested in war prior to 1500, esp. ancient civilizations.",3
105437,Excellent Course with extremely detailed lectures.,5
105438,"The professor is excellent, great didactic. Good material, readings and pictures to illustrate the course.I would only suggest to try to not repeat the content on the classes, but I understand he was repeating some topics in order to state some points.",5
105439,"Specified subject and well explained view on WAR. Was also able to understand what are the other factors that for war. Being a Research and explorer this was one of the best learning that I had in 2015.Thank you so much,",4
105440,"Enjoyed the lectures and topics, thank you",5
105441,very useful and contains interesting materials.,5
105442,"This course has been an eye opening one, clearly giving poignant insights into the life of a soldier, the nature of war and the role of societies in it!",5
105443,Very insightful!,5
105444,extraordinary.done with passion,5
105445,"Very interesting course. It helped me gain a more profound understanding of the methods of warmaking and the power an organised, well-coordinated action of a group of people has in general. The teaching approach of the professor Miguel Centeno has been one of the basic reasons for which this couse has been both so delightful and enriching. I would strongly recomend this course to everyone that is interested in the field of international affairs.",5
105446,Very interesting and very well taught.,5
105447,"It said it could be done on your schedule, but that is not true. I want to withdraw from this stupid course - it sucks.",1
105448,This course is supling different perspective for people who are interesting war sociology.,5
105449,Professor is very engaging.,5
105450,Very interesting topics about war and human history are analyzed in this course. Very recommended.,5
105451,This was a very interesting course - clearly presented and well paced. The assignments were at a good level - with my only recommendation being a bit more detail in the marking rubrik.Thank you - it was a thought provoking analysis on a topic that could be very emotional.,5
105452,"Good course, with a lot of information.",4
105453,"The passion of Prof. Centeno is contaminating, some of the issues pointed were somewhat new (I have a circle of friends from military profession) and definitely the connection of cultural basis of the society and its capacity to, and way of, fight a war is something that will change my way to see the results of these events in the future.Thank you very much for this initiative.",4
105454,I thoroughly enjoyed this course and thought it was an excellent introduction to thinking about war from a sociological perspective which picks apart our 'common sense' and 'everyday' understandings. I've also found it a great launchpad for further study.,5
105455,Very good .. congratulations,5
105456,really introductal course ive utilized.thank you.,4
105457,It´s Excellent. Congratulations to the professor.,5
105458,I love the idea of a sociological view of war.,4
105459,Great lessons and a very attractive format.,5
105460,"Very interesting course. The first few weeks are little beat boring, discussing some features that are obvious, but as the course continues the questions become more untresting, especially those which concern war with politics. As a whole it is a very good course, which gives the student a broad understandung of the issue. recommended!!",4
105461,Good information. Good discussion forum. Recommended.,4
105462,I found this course extremely interesting and very informative. I have long been interested in the evolution of society and in particular the advances made by society. The development of the nation state and its institutions was fascinating.,5
105463,"An extremely interesting course, full of fascinating sociologycal and historical topics!The only thing that wasn't that good about it was the difficulty to get some of books the instructor mentioned.",4
105464,The course was so helpful. I had the opportunity to develop myself in interesting for me area. Definitely recommend the training.,5
105465,"Great teacher, very passionate. Cheers from Australia.",5
105466,An incredible course with an amazing instructor. I love everything about it.,5
105467,"Incedible structure and professor, an absolute must for everyone to understand war as an expression of humman being",5
105468,A fantastic course if you want to realy understand what is to be a soldier.,5
105469,New format makes it impossible to watch off-line.,1
105470,This is the best of the best.,5
105471,Fantastic course on a global subject which lay in the core of the human experience. A must have course for any history lovers and geopolitical enthusiatists.,5
105472,My initial impressions are of astounding mediocrity. Amazes me how academic careers are made these days.,1
105473,I thoroughly enjoyed the course. Professor Centeno guided us through history to show that even wars can make some positive contributions to societies and to soldiers. You do not have to agree with him to notice that he is a very good online lecturer. It was my first MOOC where I felt I'm in an auditorium and not at my computer.,5
105474,"Nice course with broad overview, appropriate to wide audience concern to warfare, politics, defense and security. Also, literature is very interesting and suggested books have reasonable price. Topics of discussions are inspiring and ingratiating. Teaching style is relaxed, well pointed and very interesting.",5
105475,Great course!!,5
105476,unexpectedly thought provoking,5
105477,"Highly informtative, relevant and has been useful in cross study with other modern state of war studies, such as Terrorism and Counter Terrorism studies.",5
105478,This course has changed my view of war. It's very exciting course!,5
105479,Thanks a lot!!!,5
105480,"The lecturer explained things very detailed- oriented, and the materials are very helpful to use for a non-native speaker.",5
105481,I learned A LOT more than what expected and not just for the purpose of interview,5
105482,It is usefull because you learn about different aspecst you usually omit but now you can work on that.,5
105483,This is a wonderful class.,5
105484,"I really loved the curse material, the explanations are objective, the curse is well structured and the proffesors capture the main idea of every topic they touch, thank you",5
105485,The course is well-structured and useful. Thank you.,5
105486,10 stars. Absolutely inspiring.,5
105487,"This course should be taken by anyone involved in the processs of applying for job interviews! It's both useful and pleasant to take.I work for a big company, in France, in the field of ""science & technology R&D"", and my lab recently opened a position for which we started interviewing applicants a few weeks ago. As a member of the team the position is opened to work with, I've been involved in the interview process. I was just amazed to see how unprepared the applicants were : they made mistake after mistake. Since we also have trainees and Ph.D students in the lab, who'll soon have to search for their first job, I had a look at the MOOC offer in the field of ""preparing for job interviews"", in order to see what advice I could provide for them to get prepared for this key step in building their career.I registered to this MOOC, as an auditor, and started browsing through their videos and accompanying documents. I just got caught in right away, despite the fact that I couldn't participate (neither submit nor evaluate) in assignments: one needs to be pay for that, and I had no real interest in doing so, for now, although I truly think it's worth the cost if one is in the position of preparing for job interviews.I realised that, if the job applicants we interviewed in my lab had taken this remarkable course prior to their interviews, this would have saved them so many basic mistakes. If you never had the opportunity to reflect on what a job interview process is, and are applying for interviews, just give it a try: I bet you'll benefit from this experience a lot... and it might simply change your life! This course is the second of a series of 5 from a specialization. I already audited the first 2 courses, and I'm just eager to see the next two come on stage (the last is a capstone project I'll skip for now.)",5
105488,Very helpful information and up to date with real life examples. I enjoyed it immensely!,5
105489,Great course for the beginner. It would be better for more example and case study. Thanks. Jom,5
105490,"Fantastic, Just what you need to get started!",5

105492,"This course in the specialization was really helpful to me in shaping my service prototype by applying ""the wizard of oz"" move....... Thank you so much coursera and Wharton",4
105493,Great!,5
105494,"Excellent course. Material was informative, crisp and worth the time and effort required to internalize it. Quiz questions were varied. Tested both memory and understanding.However, there is one particular issue which I think requires scrutiny by the Coursera Team.In the Module 4: Pitching, Testing and Prototyping Quiz there is a question which goes as follows:""Which of the following is a best practice when developing survey questions?""Based on my interaction with the answers and the points I scored over the first attempt and on subsequent attempts(after making changes to the answers) I have strong reason to believe that the appropriate question should be""Which of the following is *not* a best practice when developing survey questions?""I would request the Coursera team to look into the matter.Thank you once again for making premiere education available for the masses.",5
105495,It was a very nice course . It gave me a lot of knowledge about the entrepreneurship .,5

105499,"Hello, I learned some new knowledge about entrepreneurship, and this course was helpful for me. However, there was not any reaction to the comments in the forum from instructors and mentors. I studied several courses online in the Coursera Community, and this course was the first course for me which instructors and mentors did not reply to the questions in the forums. In my opinion, the forums are one of the great features in the Coursera which could really helps student to learn the content better.Sincerely,Omid",2
105500,Not very challenging. Will be more better if there are case studies in the quiz and we answer questions applying the knowledge from the video lectures to the case studies.,2
105501,This course was amazing! It gives you practical knowledge necessary to begin the journey as an entrepreneur.,5
105502,Great first class on entrepreneurship. I learned a lot that is helping me shape a venture idea and hope that the remaining classes in the specialization will offer more of the guidance I need to move forward with my idea.,5

105511,good but we need arabic language,3
105512,Great introduction to entrepreneurship from 4-5 very talented professors who don't have just theoretical experience but actual experience as entrepreneurs.,4
105513,This is a great learning from the masters in the field. Gave a good polish to the grey areas in my knowledge.,5
105514,What an achievement has a small Entrepreneur.,5
105515,"Excellent course, it gives you the best set of concepts, tools and strategies to search, analyze and develop a business opportunity.",5
105516,"This is an incredible starting point.The main theme of the course is dealing with the intrinsic uncertainty ingrained in all entrepreneurial ventures. If you don't know how to reduce this uncertainty, you may never make it out of the developmental phases, much less procure capital investments.This course certainly doesn't cover everything but it opens the door to what you really need to focus on. Hearing the language and the terminology is incredibly beneficial.",4
105517,Great course ! It is very helpful,5
105518,very good as intro it has added to me a lot of values but still need for update it's tools and external resources,5
105519,Very good overview of how to go about analysing ones idees before going for them.,4

105530,really good stuff,5
105531,This was a very interesting course.,5
105532,Brain storming.,5
105533,"This course provides great knowledge for anyone who wants to be successful on any career path. The teachers are actually very interesting people, entrepreneurs with great stories. It was a nice surprise in the class. I was also surprised with the depth and quality of information provided, it was beyond expectations. I suggest anyone who takes this class, or any class, take notes and save them on your cloud to master. I also got more perspective on the concepts of pivoting with, not only a business, but on your career path. It really inspires me to think about the possibility of becoming a parallel or serial entrepreneur. These teachers honestly have very cool jobs, there are no limits on your career autonomy when you are a VC.",5
105534,"It is an amazing course. I had a startup a few years back and by listening to this course, I was wishing I knew these materials before I start.",5
105535,Great course!,5
105536,It was extremely intriguing and exciting to learn the program modules in such a systematic and comprehensive manner but still retain the fun elements of business and Entrepreneurship. It was gripping right till the end and I did not loose my focus even once. More than anything it was a fun learning experience and I will surely try and be a part of the second leg as well. It was an eye opener for as to how business is done and things are made to look so simple in the module by just having a systematic approach to risk and risk mitigation whilst developing a business. Thank you to all the teaching faculty for this great learning experience.,5
105537,"The course is very interesting and useful, especially for me who lives in the country encouraging mass entrepreneurship and innovation. But I cannot take the tests as an auditor. I am not working in the business, I only need to learn the knowledge first, and choose to get the certificates whenever I need. Other courses like Machine Learning allow you finish all the processes and buy later. Could these Entrepreneurship courses also do like that?",5
105538,"Brilliant course. Excellent instructors. Course structure was concise and easy to follow. I thought product demo's, use of real business case scenarios and venture's made the course more exciting and appealing. This course has certaintly given me the motivation and confidence to perhaps consider starting my own business. I will now move on to the next course of the specialisation. Thank you all very much!!!",5
105539,"This course provided me enough insights of the entrepreneurship approach. Learned many new things,going to implement now!",5
105540,Very useful but I feel in some videos the teachers talk too fast,5
105541,"excellent material on how find opportunities an develop then, from the idea to prototyping",5
105542,"I enjoyed the course very much! I can feel my perspective on the society around has changed that I have started to identify certain opportunities. In addition, my thought process about the best approach to address these opportunities has also grown.",5
105543,Great introduction to entrepreneurship. I definitely plan on completing the rest of the specialization.,5
105544,Well organized and relevant,5
105545,I found this course helpful and gave me basic ideas to brainstorm on a project which at the initial phase on finding out the right opportunity.,4
105546,The material was very informative and instructors where also very spot on with their presentation. I enjoyed the course very much and look forward to other courses in this specialization.,5
105547,"Brilliant insights, Prof Kartik is especially brilliant to listen to.Prof Ulrich has tremendous experience, and Prof. Mollick provides great confidence on how to physically do stuff.Absolutely loved it!!",5
105548,Thank You!,5
105549,"Great teachers, cases and lectures.",5
105550,Truly inspirational course with real life examples. Those who are seriously considering to become an entrepreneur MUST take this course.4 stars as there is very little to do for a person who is taking this course.,4
105551,"Excellent content, in-depth compared to may other MOOCs. The instructors have organized the lectures very well and shown some useful and practical methods that can be implemented at various stages.",4
105552,Such as great opportunity to learn this kind of course from one of the best school in the nation!,5
105553,A very practical specialization course on Entrepreneurship... solid stuff!,5
105554,"As it's the start of the whole specialisation it's not very clearly detailed. Like few lectures are amazing as solo lectures, but overall week wise all lectures do not connect so well.",4
105555,Learnt a lot in this this course by some of the best teachers.,5
105556,"Thanks all , I have learned a lot",5
105557,Absolutely Fantastic Program. Professors are the best!!,5
105558,good examples. great structure.,5
105559,Thoroughly enjoyed this opening Entrepreneurship course.,5
105560,VERY HELPFUL AS I AM LAUNCHING A STARTUP.,5
105561,Very useful and applicable. Great module,5
105562,"One of the best course available on coursera, the course has clearly helped me achieve my objective. Thanks to the excellent faculty, wouldn't have been possible without them.",5
105563,Some useful frameworks but would have preferred to see more time spent addressing models and frameworks for testing the potential success of new ideas and comparing between different ideas. The tournament model covered here was not sufficient to really address this issue and it requires more depth. But otherwise a decent introduction to those not familiar/ experienced with business/ start ups.,3
105564,Lots of great information. Very practical.,5
105565,Very interesting. It really shows you how to develop and evaluate your ideas. I was really useful,5
105566,"Great course! The content was produced very well. The course offers the slides as PDFs & makes other materials available for download as well. The information was extremely good & informative. I say this as someone who has taken multiple business classes already on entrepreneurship, as well as reading several books, & listening to many podcasts. The only things I would suggest as improvements are to in some of the optional content interviews at the end of the course it appears that they used a stereo recording which seems great but is a pain when you listen with headphones. You'll have only one headphone speaker with any sound. Also it would be great if the optional audio recordings at the end would be available for download or some other method.",5
105567,Great platform for learning and gathering new ideas,5
105568,Invaluable information in every lecture.,4
105569,Terrific real life examples and tools! Very helpful taking your idea and making it a real product and/or service. Well worth the $95.,5
105570,an insightful introduction to entrpreneurship.,5
105571,outstanding effort by wharton,5
105572,Essential materials and good teachers.,5
105573,Excellent thoughts and concepts presented.,5

105577,Learning new ways to look at business helps develop you as an entrepreneur.,5
105578,Very helpful,5
105579,It is a great course for anyone t o learn the basics of things to consider before launching a successful business enterprise.Kudos to all U Penn professors who have dedicated a lot of time to create this master piece of an online course.,5
105580,Highly educative and easily understandable. looking forward to the further assignments.,5
105581,Some of the lecturers have insightful examples that help you as you take this course. Very informative for short video classes.,4
105582,"best, as per my knowledge.",5
105583,"I felt the first week offered almost no valuable information, and when purchasing a specialization, I expect every week to be full of facts. After that it picked up and I became satisfied. I would purchase it again.",4
105584,"This 4 week Course has been very informative and inspiring. While taking it, I found myself thinking up many ideas and being able to give some structure to a few of them. I signed up for the entire specialization and can't wait to start the next one.",5
105585,Very helpful insight into theory of entrepreneurship,5
105586,This was a great course. It gave an amazing overview of the Business Idea and Opportunity. It allowed me to understand the overall process. I now know how to choose what business idea to develop and also what steps there are in launch. I learned some things here that I never knew about prototypes and how to test a service business. I do wish there were more of a focus on the Service Sector. Many people these days are creating businesses in that sector and it would help me to have a better understanding on those topics.,4
105587,"Good starter material, though that's my totally inexperienced opinion. If anything, perhaps too easy, but more often than not I found valuable information, whether it was new material, or something I thought was plain and straight forward but turned out not to be the case or worked in a different way!",5
105588,Totally recommended and a good start for the series. Also very motivational.,4
105589,This course is very practical and insightful. I recommend this course if you are interested in Entrepreneurship.,5
105590,"Excellent course; it breaks the process down into logical, manageable pieces and stitches them together into unified pattern.",5
105591,this course is one of the greatest sources of information that I have been able to get my hands on.,5
105592,"The course was excellent. Each topic that is introduced is explored deeply while real life tested examples are simultaneously provided. It teaches you a lot of strategies on how you can go about your own business and how ideas can be converted into real life models. It also comprehensively goes into a lot of strategies while explaining how they work. A lot of hypothetical situations are also provided which help you to think in those lines and be able to tackle situation. From the most effective way of brainstorming to how to collect survey data effectively. This course has it all. I would like to thank all the professors that were involved in the making of the course, its taught me a great lot and I can't wait to progress through the other courses. Even though I'm only 16 years old, this courses offers things for everyone. Even if you aren't an entrepreneur, its a great course to be part of!",5
105593,Great course!!,4
105594,"Great resource on opportunity analysis, what to consider when you have an idea in mind!",5
105595,It's a great course to give you a real sense about opportunities and how to evaluate them.,5

105599,Figure out whether your idea makes sense to go to market,3
105600,"Amazing course! Even though I have already have a business degree I learned so much. Instructors are clear, concise and provide great examples.",5
105601,"It is a great specialization!The professors are really engaged and they find a great balance between providing the latest research on entrepreneurship as well as teaching practical insights.Personally, I really enjoy that the professors have own experience in building a start-up and are willing to share their experiences and learnings with us. This makes the course even more tangible and valuable...",5
105602,"Very useful combination of stats, tips and advise",4
105603,Good pace and very valuable information shared in this course. I recommend the additional optional cases. Thats golden!,5
105604,"The content is great, and the teachers are awesome. Very glad I could learn from them",5
105605,I really enjoyed this course. It stretched me to think beyond my scope and I'm looking forward to commencing further modules in the Entrepreneurship Specialisation.,5
105606,"This course provides a broad overview of the entrepreneurial process and comes complete with plenty of actionable material. It lacks any sort of meaningful collaboration with other students, which seems to be an inherent flaw of the MOOC platform more than a fault of this course. I will be taking the rest of the specialization, and hope the capstone can bring like minded students together to turn the theory we learn throughout this course series into reality.",4
105607,"Good course.I did find the quizes not as challenging as the Marketing and Accounting courses I took through Wharton/ Coursera. Sometimes it seems some of the Professors talk very quickly as opposed to the Core MBA offerings. Overall, great content. Thank you!",4
105608,Lots of interesting material!,5
105609,Embedded one page case study in the middle of the lecture videos with a followup debrief or the same during the assignments would be extremely useful.,4
105610,fresh and reliable information i loved it! thnks,5
105611,Lots of theory but includes some useful models and formulas,3
105612,"As a complete neophyte of Entrepreneurship myself, couse 1 of this specialization successfully enganges the neophyte student. like me, into the field of Entrepreneurship and particularly to the subject of developing the opportunity. Really wonderful presentation of the essence of developing the entrepreneurial opportunity.",5
105613,"Very comprehensive and well mentored course, I feel privileged to study this course!",5
105614,Really pragmatic! I have started to use it in my business and hope to get a good result!,5
105615,"Very good course, amazing content.",5
105616,Great Learning Experience. Clear lectures and beneficial. Looking forward to the next session.,5
105617,Good course. But the content is very less.You should include some readings and longer videos.Thank you everyone.,5
105618,Great beginning for any course in entrepreneurship! Liked the way opportunity space is explained in course. Very clear delivery and language used.,5
105619,Thanks a lot Professors & Wharton. Great Job. Please do some Workshop in Canada,5
105620,Great professors and valuable knowledge about entrepreneurship.,5
105621,Very good faculty.... good practical examples,5
105622,"I really like this course and all the teachers from different areas , thanks for the opportunity to learn",5
105623,"Overall, a good course. Slow at first. The class first had me concerned if I was going to learn anything new, but toward middle way, the relevancy really picked up. I am very curious to see what the Wharton School team of professors have to share in the next class.",4
105624,Looking forward to the rest of this series. Informative. Easy to follow. Extremely helpful.,5
105625,"Such a wonderful and comprehensive course, all the professors were so knowledgeable that I have got something new in each and every second. This course will help me in my teaching profession. I want to pay great thanks to Coursera for providing such a brilliant platform, and to the Wharton for providing so productive course. I recommend each and every to take this course.",5
105626,"It's great to learn the entrepreneurship here, this course expended my vision, offer me a new tool to thinking.",5
105627,Great course,5
105628,"This course has been phenomenal. Moves a lot of concepts from ""magical"" territory into tools that I can use over and over.",5
105629,This is an excellent course. It prepares you with everything you need in order to learn how to develope a business opportunity just from the idea.I do recommend it 100%.,5
105630,Prof Hsu is not enthusiastic / gripping in presentations and so the material he teaches doesnt stick.,4
105631,"Very informative! After finishing part one, I now know that this is the program I want to take. I look forward to learning how exactly how to start my company!",5
105632,Examples are very helpful,5
105633,"Overall, this was an excellent course and, for the beginner, a great foray into general entrepreneurship concepts and ideas. Here's why I say that:1) The professors offering the course are apparently top-notch - they all have extensive and varied experiences with entrepreneurship, and many of them have published research and reports that can be found with a quick google search.2) The amount and nature of the content make it so that it's easy to approach the course more like a workshop, than some static didactic. For example, one of Ethan Mollick's talks comes with a spreadsheet to help students think a little more concretely and specifically about their ventures.3) The course passed no judgement on push vs. pull ventures; they really tried to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of each. With the business community's surge in interest in design-thinking, I had been under the false impression that a push venture, by definition, was inferior.I gave 4 instead of 5 stars, however, because I feel that more attention could have been devoted to more service-oriented or product and service hybrid businesses (though the professors didn't totally ignore the service-oriented business). Also, I was under the impression that the professors would have some degree of real-time interaction with students (although I get that they are super busy), or that even if the professors themselves couldn't respond, that a teacher's assistant or representative would comment on questions raised about the course content.Again, this is overall a fantastic course, though not perfect - I would still highly recommend it to anyone thinking about entrepreneurship!",4
105634,"Really great course! As an experienced entrepreneur, I must admit, there was value in the information provided and HOW it was communicated. Loved it!",5
105635,Important topic taught by real experts,5
105636,"Excellent Course. If you are really keen on being a entrepreneur, irrespective of the kind, this course definitely has really valuable lessons to offer.",5
105637,It is awesome cant wait till the next course is here !!!,5
105638,Overall good course. The slides should've been presented in only one document per module - like almost all previous courses of Wharton. All of the optional videos with interviews had audio problems (I could only hear them from the left speaker).,4
105639,Happy to learn these valuable concepts from top class faculty.,5
105640,Amazing Course!,5
105641,Doing this course in tandem with the Technion's course and i am really excited about both of them :),5
105642,"This course is simply amazing. It is well-thought, practical, and insightful! I`m amazed of how an introductory course on a specific topic can inspire and motivate oneself so much!",5
105643,So far Excellent. I am planning to start my own business and I think this is a great step one source of information.,5
105644,"This course is exactly what I have been waiting for. Not having had the opportunity to have a business education, these teachings are invaluable to me.",5
105645,"This is the best course I've taken up on Coursera. Prof. Sachs is a delight to listen to and his passionate way of teaching, which is real and practical, makes me look forward to the lectures. Thank You Professor. And Thank You Coursera :)",5
105646,"Very good, but after all the hard work one should be able to pursue a paid certificate at least",4
105647,A very interesting introduction to Sustainable Development and a nice journey led by professor Jeffrey Sachs,4
105648,"a very good course, recommended",5
105649,this education is very useful and it is important for personal development.,5
105650,"Hi, I loved this course. However I'm a bit surprised that didn't got a certificate for doing it. That's why I don't put 5 stars.",3
105651,"Excellent course! Thoroughly enjoyed learning about sustainable development from Dr Jeffrey Sachs, I especially liked that every week addressed a different topic and how he explained everything so clearly. The only suggestions I would make is to regularly review quiz and final tests links as they were sometimes broken/outdated resulting in missing question(",5
105652,"Excellent course for anyone interested in receiving the best tuition from one of the most respected and renowned professors on the subject in the world. As someone who has suffered with terrible attention spans from a very young age in school (ADD, day-dreamer, still re-training the habit!), I managed to stay engaged through out the lectures and course. The video format is especially useful for someone like myself who needs to frequently pause, make notes, rewind to listen/watch the meaning of content again, and again. I was able to comprehend and digest complicated information, i.e., to actually let it sink in if I was unable to understand the first time around. Prof Sachs manages to draw in your attention and focus through his excellent AAA+ delivery, charm and genuine passion on this subject. Absolutely thrilled with results! Bravo!",5
105653,I'm so happy to have passed through this course. It has exposed me to the real facts about Humanity on earth and what needs to be done to keep us here long enough. Thanks to Professor Jeffrey Sachs and all members of the course team,4
105654,Great introductory overview to sustainable development. Very passionate teacher with extensive back up information.,5
105655,Great course. Interesting to learn about historical errors and what lead to the SDG's.Sustainable Development is the way to go.An update would be interesting thoughThank You Pr Sachs and mentors.,5
105656,This course was very informative and delivered in a comprehensible manner. The topics were well designed and flowed in a sequence that helped the learner add on the knowledge as they progressed. I was inspired to do new things towards a globally sustainable world even in my little corner. It was a previledge to be taught by the very experienced Prof Jeffrey Sachs! Thank you Coursera!,5
105657,Really enjoyed this course. Learned a great deal about ways to effectively make change locally and globally. Also learned a great deal about past failures. The readings were exptensive but outstanding.,5
105658,"I'm a plan and policy analyst. I got a lot of idea for policy planing by SDGs guideline and some indicator that make the following process more clearly. But a few link for quiz have not working, please update.",4
105659,"Great course, though it would be even better if certificates were awarded!",5
105660,"Dr. Sachs is a very engaging professor and the topics discussed are very interesting. If you are into sustainability, this is the ""I must have"" course. I enjoyed every bit of it, and it lead me to search for Dr. Sachs books and read them. Just awesome!!!",5
105661,"One of the most eye-opening and enjoyable courses I have ever taken! Thank you Professor Sachs, and best of luck in the U.N.",5
105662,"I initially came to this course looking for more environmental science knowledge, but I was surprised (in a good way) when the professor spent most of the time giving historical and economic context to the current environmental situation. He really helped me consider the ""macro"" of how we got to where we are, and how we can continue to move forward sustainably. He has incredible professional background in the subject matter, and it was exciting to hear about his personal involvement in creating international agreements. I've never thought so much about international relations before, and I'm happy I learned more than I expected to!I would recommend this course for anyone who wants to learn more about international relations, politics, economics, world history, environmental science, healthcare, or international development. He really covers a lot! There's something for everyone, whether you have no previous knowledge or have already taken a few similar classes.I loved how everything was in a predictable format of five 10-25 minute videos in each section with a 10-question quiz at the end. The videos were very engaging because they had interesting b-roll and even music! It felt like a documentary in a way. (Of course, you can also speed them up by making them play 1.25-1.5 speed.)My only suggestion for improvement is for the TAs (or whomever) to go back through the quiz website links and update them. I ran into more than a few that were outdated and I had to hunt down the answer somewhere else, or just guess. This wasn't a major burden, though.Thanks for an amazing course! I'm starting my next Coursera class right away!",5
105663,"Some of the links are no longer functioning and thus, gaining access to exact information for the past (2013) is not possible.",3
105664,"One of the best courses I attended here.High competence, good knowledge transfer and very interesting topics.",5
105665,Great course but content and quizzes need updating. Certificate would be nice.,3
105666,"A very well organized and taught mooc lectured by someone with enormous experience in the area, a must do to everyone involved in the development of human societies.",5
105667,Slightly outdated.,4
105668,Great course! All subjects are well explained and Professor Sachs makes the videos very interesting and enjoyable to watch.,5
105669,"Professor was quite knowledgeable, and covered a breadth of topics. However, he often presented his political opinion as scientific fact. The quizzes/tests were also based on regurgitation of data/knowledge, rather than higher-order thinking such as application or synthesis",3
105670,"Great survey course about sustainable development, covering all aspects including economics, health, urban development, energy, climate change, and many others. Only downside is that it leaves you somewhat depressed at the potential for humanity to pull itself out of what appears to be a speeding train to doom :-(",5
105671,"Great information and Dr. Sachs is very easy to listen to. Strange that the quizzes test skills that are not covered in the lectures, and reference material on the quiz is very cumbersome on mobile devices. Still, very educational and worthwhile overall.",4
105672,"This is the best course I have ever taken. Professor Sachs did an amazing job in putting together such a great material for us. It covers every single aspect of Sustainable Development, going from in-depth historical background to potential challenges to be faced in the future. Words cannot describe how mu",5
105673,"By far, one of the best courses I've taken at Coursera. It opened my eyes to the phenomena around us, and what the co-relation between all the factors in our lives amounts to the changes we've induced to the planet. It has made me rethink my own life, my work, and the urgency I have as volunteer member of a Disaster Risk Reduction to multiply this information to as much persons as I can. Dr. Sachs explains every detail and definition with such simplicity that it makes it possible for anybody to understand the severity of the challenges were faced at this moment in time.",5
105674,"Interesting, brilliant ! A must-read !!!!",5
105675,Great course that allow us to have a broader perception of modern challenges and opportunities,5
105676,"Thank you Professor Sachs for the lectures. Truly delightful and enjoyable to learn through the courses, and see humanity's inspiring endeavours in setting our path into the age of sustainable development!",5
105677,"Professor Sach's discussion, as well as the course materials, were sufficiently encompassing and thoroughly researched. The course presented a good overview of the climate change problem as well as how humanity can overcome these obstacles through sustainable development.",5
105678,An excellent course one must take who is interested in the issues of the present world and the solutions for these issues. Professor Jeffrey sachs has done a great job. Thumbs up.,5
105679,"Having always had a keen interest in issues pertaining to the MDGs and the SDGs, I thought the course would give me greater insight into problems and solutions therein impacting our world today and was not deceived by the content. I particularly appreciate Professor Sachs personal interpretations and opinions on certain issues; Coming from him, issues have become more credible for me.Highly recommend the topics to not only course takers but anyone interested in the Earth's health.",5
105680,This course is very well designed and cover all major themesm giving overall and global view on current global development. Highly recommend to all!,5
105681,"This course was very interesting, and the lectures are wonderfully presented. I learned a lot and enjoyed the lectures each week. Thank you!",5
105682,Beautiful learning tools,4
105683,Prof. Sachs was able to open my eyes about a lot of subjects I had never deepen before. I suggest this coure to anyone wants to become more aware of the real life that surrounds us. Thanks Prof. Sachs!,5
105684,I am a graduate of mater in international relations and this course was very helpful for me to recap what I learned and improve my knowledge. I would highly recommend to everyone regardless of level of one's education or major.,5
105685,A fantastic foundation in sustainable development. Well structured lectures and set at a good pace. Recommend getting associated book as it's good to refer back to.,5
105686,"Really good course as introduction to Sustainable development, includes main concepts and history require to have a general understanding of the subject. Very good examples and tests",5
105687,I feel Proactive now with regards to climate change. The beginning of much intrinsic learning about what can be done . We are not without hope,5
105688,"Professor Sachs is preaching to the choir with this course, and such a ponderous emphasis on the seriousness of the dangers of ""business as usual"" is unnecessary. The lectures are much longer than they need to be. Otherwise, this course is very valuable.",4
105689,This is one of the best courses that I've ever seen! And this is so crucial for us to understand everything claimed here and make our world sustainable. Thank you for the course!,5
105690,"Mandatory for every human being !!! Awareness and clear, deep understanding will put the people in the right lane for the race and the succes in sustainable development !",5
105691,Thank you all very much for your efforts. Very informative course.,4
105692,The course covers the fundamental topics in sustainable development. It's an excellent introductory course.,5
105693,"This is an excellent course, the content its related to hard data to support it. Also contains a lot of useful tools to analyze data and compare information. I highly recommend the book to check more specific information. Is not just informative but calls for action, I´m ready to take the next step and move to contribute an promote the SDG.",5
105694,Loved this course is a shame that is not possible to pay a personalized certificated other than that is a great course.,5
105695,Interesting and important topics discussed during this course - definitely worth it!,4
105696,"Very interesting course, and a privilege to have such an incredibly knowledgable professor.",5
105697,Essential knowledge for the 21st century,5
105698,Great!,5
105699,"Great course that highlights the need to take action to save our planet so we can continue to prosper and thrive. For that, a lot of things need to change. Dr. Jeffrey D. Sachs points out where the challenges are and helps us form ideas to shape a new future.",5
105700,The course gave me a broad perspective on global issues and methodologies towards Sustainable Development.,5
105701,"I thought most of the discussions were ""____ needs to do this, _____ needs to learn to do this."" Yet doesn't provide a lot of concrete answers that helpful to solve x. And I understand some situations are complex with a lot of variables, but it seems as though a lot of ""environmental proponents"" just talk about stuff and don't give examples of what they are doing to change the world. I think Jadav Payeng (""the forest man of india"") has done more for the environment than all the attendees at all of these environmental conferences do. Courses like these highlight all the problems (and there are a fuck ton of problems) but contain fewer answers. So it just leaves the ""graduate"" overwhelmed and kind of spinning in a circle. I think I'd rather have a course that asks, why do we wear what we do when its made on the other side of the globe, is that the best for the environment? We need to wholesale changes in how we think about our society if we want it to be sustainable; not, we have problems over here and here and here, and if we put this bandaid on it, that might fix it for a while. I was just very unimpressed and skipped through the program as quickly as I could /rant",2
105702,Cool and prestigious . GRATEFUL,5
105703,This course warrants a certificate. What a shame it does not.,5
105704,"Amazing course, loved it!",5
105705,"It was an incredible privilege to be taught by Prof Sachs, during this course. The content challenged some of the current views I held about sustainable development and encouraged my own thinking on the subject matter within my skill set. Highly recommendable!!",5
105706,Very informative and interesting. The links to various sources in the tests are not up to date though and make it difficult to get a 100% score.,4
105707,An excellent course which guides you through practical and theoretical issues which puts great technical detail into the broader subject matter of sustainability.,5
105708,Inspiring course. It gives you a precise image of the world and how it is developing and how general dynamics work.,5
105709,Excellent course to understand the challenges that we are facing everyday and what needs to be done if we want a sustainable future.,5
105710,"Gave me a different perspective of looking at things, some which are outside my normal environment.",5
105711,"Very enriching course. It is very important to know better the world we live in, it's challenges and possible solutions.",5
105712,Great course for understanding the complexity of developing countries...Thanks Prof. Sachs,5
105713,"Jeffrey Sachs is a great analytical thinker on the issue of sustainable development - a terrific teacher. If you have an 'activist' mind and are emotional about the issues involved, learn from a UN-level, world-travelled, expert some of the intelligent tools for going into the subject dispassionately. It's a great service that Prof Sachs has prepared and recorded almost 30 hours of 'talk time', free of charge. The recording is from 2015, so the earlier one takes the course, the less dated the course may seem! In fact, a few web links (URLs) had already moved as of Oct-Dec 2016 when I took this course. And did a very few quiz answers seem wrong - maybe because some economic indicators had been revised? Coursera's course delivery infrastructure is also excellent - clickable transcripts that take you to the same spot in the recording as the text, downloadable videos to watch offline, tracking that helps you resume exactly where you last stopped, all of which seemed to work without glitches. Deadlines and reminders are thoughtful - hard, yet offering alternatives",5
105714,"Prof Sachs takes us through a very interesting and engaging course on the need for sustainable development. It is simple in most parts. While I enjoyed the number crunching questions in the quiz, I can imagine that it is not for everyone. It is extremely informative, and I have filled up a notebook with my notes from all of the 15 lectures.Just taking a star away for some of the links or course material not being updated. For instance the links to external websites are not valid any more. Also, the actual SDG's are different from the ones in the lecture, as the ones in the lecture were proposed as against the current actual ones.",4
105715,"This course has been deeply informative. The instructor is outstanding, sharing his deep experience and knowledge of economics, geography, international development, and earth science through the lectures. The time commitment required for this course is minimal considering the immense treasure of learning it represents. My only issues with this course (hence 4 stars instead of 5) are: 1. no one is monitoring the course, so questions/comments are only answered by other students; and 2. there is no certificate. Thank you Coursera and Dr. Sachs for this fantastic course!",4
105716,"a horrible perishing, SD MUST BE ACHIEVED! The knowledge gained out of this course is by far beyond ""a mere awareness on SD"". The course ought to be part of a curricula and further enriched to yield a degree, thus opening up more perspectives for life and career development. BIEN JOUE, PROFESSOR!",5
105717,"Wonderful content and exposure to world data sources. The only thing that prevents me from giving it 5 stars were some of the errors in quizzes scoring quesitons incorrectly--but overall, this was not a hinderance to learning and getting something out of the class.",4
105718,Excellent information,5
105719,very helpful course,5
105720,"Very insightful course, covers a lot of information, motivates to continue learning within the field. Thank you very much for these interesting past few months!",5
105721,"This set of videos really gives you a complete view of what sustainability must deal with and I really liked the type of tests used as they are not about how much you can memorize, but how able you are to analize. It tooked me a while, but I really liked it.",5
105722,highly recommended!,5
105723,"This course gave an excellent overview of Sustainability. What that entails and why it is crucial to develop and push toward global goals (SDGs) in this ""Anthropocene"" we find ourselves in today. The text gives a good look at all concepts related to Sustainability and resources to find more data and information for each heading. Professor Sachs' lectures were great and as were the tools used and recommended readings. There were some errors and discrepancies in the quizzes, but aside from that I would highly recommend this course.",4
105724,Great course!,5
105725,Amazing course. Prof. Sachs is a great lecturer and I everything we learned was extremely relevant and interesting. Highly recommend to everyone!,5
105726,"This course blew my mind. Sachs does a fantastic job explaining the relationship of our species with the environment and, at the same time, proposes several solutions to mitigate or eliminate the imbalances which humanity has been generating since the industrial revolution. Every topic is threaded very nicely. Very informative and a true eye-opener.",5
105727,Very good course! The only thing that i must criticise is that in many weekly tests there are mistakes. This can get a little bit frustrating,4
105728,"If you are looking for a MOOC please INVEST in this course, no matter who you are it will change your mind on the role the people have on Earth. It has been quite a pleasure to be part of the selected group of inhabitants from developing countries that realized not only problems of BAU path, but the alternative solutions to undertake sustainable development actions NOW! Thanks Professor Sachs and teaching team!",5
105729,I've really enjoyed this course and I enjoyed following the lectures. I feel a need to do something real a sustainable world.,4
105730,"This course should be taught in all schools in order to develop an awareness and a common goal around sustainable development. I really enjoyed the talks and Prof. Sachs is an incredible lecturer, engaging and knowledgeable. It would be good if it was a bit more updated and keeping the tabs on recent developments but overall i learned a huge amount and wouldn't doubt recommending this course to every individual in this world we share.",5
105731,"By far the best course I have seen in coursera. I have bought the book, downloaded every video and engrossed myself in it. captivating!!!!",5
105732,I reccommend it to anyone intrested in development,5
105733,"Indeed it has been a Great course and truly inspiring! The course helped to learn about sustainable development, its dimensions, planetary boundary & challenges and the possible solutions. The course has given me new areas to think about development and sustainable development. This is really an eye opening course. It has helped me to develop insight and foresight to look at some of the areas in our business. The material of this course was so easy for me to follow because of how relevant and interesting the videos lectures are. Professor Jeffrey Sachs has presented every topics in a very superb and professional ways. He has given a good number of useful links which are highly informative and relevant to understand international development dynamics. The fellow learners has made a great contribution to make the course easier and successful for me. The course made me more optimistic & confident regarding my role in my organization and society. I would like to take this opportunity to thanks to Professor Jeffrey Sachs you truly rocked my world. Your presentation incredibly inspired me to learn more. Thank you for being one of the few great teachers out there. Thanks to Colombia University and Coursera for giving me the privilege to learn the course. Hope to learn more about the sustainable development & related courses in future.",5
105734,A great course with a fantastic course book. Easy to follow with good instructions.,5

105736,I loved it! very interesting!,5
105737,A wonderful course delivered by one of the best professors I have ever met. I highly recommend it to every leader or aspiring leader in the world today.,5
105738,Great course. Loved it.,4
105739,I think Prof Sachs is an excellent lecturer and his course was both broad and deep enough to give me the grounding I want in sustainability. I love the fact that throughout the course he is so professional yet at the end he gets choked up with passion about the future of the planet. It will be my privilege to pass on what I have learnt.I would suggest that he takes a more than occasional swig of water so that the vocal chords remain in good condition to talk without coughing. All up - excellent grade from me!!,5
105740,"An excellent course, especially for those looking for a career in international development.",4
105741,Excellent course and Professor.It contains relevant topics and the web links are important. I wish the good health to my professor.,5

Thank you.,5
105743,"I learned about the secrete of sustainable development. Actually, I didn't know the Golden rules of sustainable development in such a details. I learned about social economic growth, the threats of poverty as well as environmental protection topic in such a beautiful ways that I never had chance to learn before. Furthermore, Rural and Urban relationship and the issues of income and comparison of wellbeing between the two segregated groups of people who are living for 1000s of years. In addition to that, I learned how important is the relationship between culture, education, and gender issues in the rural area and how strongly it impact the human being (negative or Positively ) life the community. Moreover, I learned about the environmental changes and threatening of Global Food Security system and Global Food Supply . Sustainable Cities and the patterns of the urbanization were another important part in these lectures. Climate Changes and its impact on Global Security and Future threats were very important topics which drew my attention.Very outstanding program which I had chance through Coursera Program to learn and add to my knowledge. I will definitely share all these information in my family, community, network and in my career life and will voluntarily advocate for the SDG goals for our future generation.I love DrJeffrey Sachs. I respect him and respect his knowledge and the job he has been doing to our generation and our grand kids.Thanks everyone who helped, managed, and developed such a amazing program .regards;Zekria Danishyar",5
105744,It was really tasking and demanding for me but i enjoyed every bit of Professor's lecture. He provided detailed insights into every aspect of sustainable development needed for every government of every country.,4
105745,"Excellent course - it should be required for all human beings, so to make more responsible choices about how we choose to live on the planet. I learned a great deal - highly informative and interesting. I was engaged throughout the whole course.",5
105746,"its a very interesting course who try to give a complet view of the one of the most challenge of XXI century, the sustainable development, i really enjoy the different chapters of the course, and i think the proffesor Jeffey Sachs is great expositor and have easy going arguments that guide u to undersentand the goals for the future.",5
105747,"Captivating, inspiring allows to fully understand the reasons for a sustainable future",5
105748,A really good and interesting course. Well presented and with interesting data to keep everyone involved.,5
105749,Holistic vision of the sustainable development and of the challenges that the humanity must confront. Many people should follow this course to wake consciences up.,5
105750,Great course. It provides you a lot of useful information and tools towards to take actions in saving the world of ourselves.,5
105751,A lot of references that helps to understand the complex situation of sustainable development.,4
105752,Excelent course! Strongly recommend it!,5
105753,"We inspiring course!!! I would say, this is one of the best course I ever attended online particularly on sustainable development. I would recommend this course to everyone who is working in the area of development.",5
105754,"That course describes the challenges of society, economy and environment face and provides solutions through the sustainable development .",5
105755,"Great course, it was an enjoyable learning path.",5
105756,Great course! Significant issues covered and well presented. Data errors in the quizzes make it less charming however.,4
105757,"This is a really interesting and inspiring course and I learned a lot. I think some of the lectures, if not the whole course, should be compulsory viewing for our world's so-called political leaders and business leaders as well.",5
105758,"Exceptional content. High level text, graphs and references. Prof. Sachs is a great lecturer! So much we can learn from him and be better human beings.",5
105759,"Good course, but outdated. The SDGs were agreed upon in 2015 and there are already ajor efforts ongoing to implement them. The course only mentioned the draft SDGs, which changed considerably later on. Therefore, the course is useful for Background Information on SDGs, but not to get up-to-date with the SDG process.",2
105760,"So far, the best course I took. Very timely and relevant. Coming from a very technical/scientific background, this course taught me about the nuances of governance, policy-making, corporate responsibility among many other things. It is good to have a historical and global perspective of economic development, the aggregate of human activities and our impact to the planet. While it seemed bleak to accomplish the goals set forth to obtain sustainable development, Dr. Sachs ended in a hopeful note. We do need more people that will ask and answer the question: ""Why not?"" I wish to learn more, if not work to help sustainable development a reality. While the SDGs are interconnected, I hope there will be a more detailed online course about each to the extent that people can focus on one or two. For my part, I would like to learn more about the underpinnings of SDG 7: Affordable and clean energy. SDGs 12 and 10 also form my core personal values and causes. Now looking for related-reading materials.",5
105761,"I learnt so much from this course, and really appreciated the manner in which Professor Sachs logically and systematically presented the content",5
105762,very good knowledge,5
105763,"This was an amazing course on improving the planet world wide by improving core standards for all people, such as safe drinking water, health care, maternal and baby care, education, etc. If countries that are meeting these core standards, contribute to the countries where people live in extreme poverty, then everyone on the planet will have a life that meets the basic standards and helps these poorer countries become sustainable themselves. The whole world benefits from every country being sustainable.",5
105764,"Excellent material for today that determines the future! It engages one to think, act & move now for the love of our children and this planet! Truly, Prof. Sachs is one of the great prophets of today that reminds us what of what was spoken by great men 5,000 years ago!",5
105765,"Interesting, engaging and valuable. Thank you!",5
105766,"started quite good, but slow videos and the last quiz was about just numbers. it is good to know what are the measurements, but if we won't teach about that too, the more concrete informations and not numbers would be more informative and useful.",3
105767,"Outstanding. I found Professor Sachs course immensely valuable in building a deeper understanding of humanity's most urgent treats and possible ways forward in the Antropocene age. To effect the desire outcomes, the course should be compulsory for policy makers, corporate board members, educators, students, change-agents, as well as citizens at large. However, it can be strongly argued if sustainable development goals are collectively feasible or a paradox when economic models and growth metrics used by most economies continue to ignore environmental impacts, Earth's finite resources, and systemic economic inequality. A systems approach to restructuring economic models is needed. We need an economic system that protects our shared commons and promotes better corporate governance - that includes comprehensive accounting of the biocapacity of the planet and our environmental impacts, and, a broader metric of human well-being (vs. GDP) that reduces economic inequality and internalizes externalities. In short, a new economic paradigm must be in place. As a next step, I would welcome a serious discourse and examination of current economic models and how they can be enhanced to drive sustainable development.Respectfully submitted,Ed Wong",5
105768,"This course is a ""merit good"" that it must be taught to everyone",5
105769,Woa!! great!,5
105770,"Great course. Informative, though provoking and inspiring. Could do with a slight update to include recent events, but it's still awesome.",5
105771,"I thoroughly enjoyed this course since Prof. Sachs was so knowledgable in all the aspects of SD- economic, political, social and environmental. I could see from the last video that he is very passionate about what he teaches.I have gained so much knowledge from this course and I am very grateful to Prof.Sachs for doing this.IndumathiEnvironmental Science StudentIndia",5
105772,"Amazing course! The videos are nicely edited with images, videos, and sound track. Also, professor Jeffrey Sachs makes it super easy to understand through the use of various graphs and examples. You don't have to be an environmentalist to enjoy the course as it provide many interesting facts and perspective about our world. Definitely recommend to everyone!",5
105773,Amazing course every one should take!,5
105774,"I am into the 9th week of the course and find it very helpful. My educational background is in technology and I graduated 25 years back. By virtue of prior in person classes and associated readings, I have acquired some knowledge in the area of environment laws and human rights. This course has very nicely and gently put things into context - for example colonization and economic development, impact of geography, role of international assistance in development (to name a few). With the basic comfort and confidence, now I can think of reading further in these areas, which in the absence of the context and background has always appeared a daunting task. My sincere thanks for the effort which would have gone into producing this course and making it available to all.",5
105775,Brilliant!,5
105776,Such an wonderful course! Highly recommended.,5
105777,Outstanding course with a phenomenal lecturer! The subject was so interesting that it got me watching some of the lectures again!,5
105778,So happy to take this course.,5
105779,"I found this course really useful and I recommend it for all the students or people that are interested about International Development, Sustainability, Problem solving solutions, or like the professor said, for the dreamers that hope that a better world can be possible.",5
105780,"Some questions in the quiz do not have the proper data sources. Please review quiz questions, sources and answers expected. Thank you very much for this learning opportunity.<Sincere thanks and deep admiration and gratitude to Prof. Sachs for his genuine, continuous contributions to society. He is a true insporation to me.Kind regards,yullie matsouka",5
105781,Excellent introduction to this vast and critical issue. Lectures are carefully prepared and all the information supported with data.Highly recommended.,5
105782,Great Course.Thank you!,5
105783,"WOW! Excellent classes! I highly recommend, as a LL.M. in International Environmental Law.",5
105784,Great overview of all topics of sustainability.,5
105785,Great course!,5
105786,very complete and interesting,4
105787,Amazing lecturer. I love the materials presented too. Thank you.,5
105788,Nice course. I learnt so much but I am disappointed there's no certificate after all.,4
105789,a great course.... loved it!,5
105790,"Extremely well done videos, Professor Sachs is articulate and clear. The videos are a bit lengthy 25 minutes each so this asks quite some time investment.The quiz are not easy, one must often look up charts and work with various statistical methods which were not always easy to manage - hence the 4 instead of 5. However this does force one into mining world organizations for data so overall it's a good learning process. It never fails to amaze me how much data we have collected globally and for so long!",4
105791,Excellent course. Could not recommend this highly enough!,5
105792,"The course is very interesting and i like simply because it is very appropriate approach in this economic driven world to rethink about our planet and instigate a paradigm shift in thinking. As I am from small landlocked Himalayan country known as Bhutan (country of Gross National Happiness), the course is very vital in achieving the objectives of our philosophical concept of GNH. The course is Excellent!",5
105793,"Excellent Professor! Great course, the best I have ever taken on Coursera.",5
105794,Course is informative and educational as well.,5
105795,"Sachs is doing valuable work and I like the premise of the course very much. The videos seemed to present a lot of painfully obvious information, however, and I'm afraid they were not terribly engaging. Maybe just too much/too long? A shorter version of the course that digs in a little deeper somehow might be more alluring.",3
105796,"Speechless,! I'll simply quote another reviewer who spelt it out in one short sentence "" This is simply the best course you can ever take on coursera"". Professor Sachs provided answers I have been looking for but couldn't find in countless areas. It would have been a shame if I lived through this life without ever discovering this astounding course.",5
105797,Great course. Great Professor. Lot's of knowledge in here,5
105798,Extremely interesting. A great way to understand today's world and to try to put our future,5
105799,Inspirational teacher!,5
105800,One of the best courses I have ever encountered in Coursera. It is really a developmental science.,5
105801,Unbelievable quality and density of information. Even more so because it is free!! Incredible! Hats off to Jeffery D. Sachs and this revolutionary work for our world.,5
105802,"Excelent Professor, with great contents! A course that should be attended by everybody.",5
105803,"Really impressive course, easy yet very informative, highly recommended!",5
105804,Very clear and concise.,5
105805,Interesting course and interesting people to share thoughts with. Highly recommended!,5
105806,"It was like reading a good book, I couldn't keep away!",5
105807,Great materials by a GREAT professor!!!,5
105808,"Course provided me great insight regarding different dimension of development and what is the appropriate definition of 'development'. The least developed countries of today will achieve the status of 'most developed countries' however, the cost that environment has paid for the present 'most developed countries' need to be taken care of with a balanced approach. The shackles of poverty can only be removed by social inclusion and creating good public policy. This course has added a new perspective about sustainable development.",5
105809,Best course I have ever taken on Coursera. Truly enlightning,5
105810,Incredibly eye-opening and insightful. Dr Sachs is clear and coherent in his execution of this course. I highly recommend this course to everyone.,5
105811,"Excellent course content but very poorly designed quizzes. More clarity is needed in formulating questions, since different pages have different values for the same data sets (even on the same website such as the World Bank indicator datasets) and it will be difficult for students to get the right answers.",1
105812,"An amazing perspective of whats is happening now, what is being done and what should be done.",5
105813,Very Interesting and helpful. It's a way to open our mind and definitely something that everyone should know about before it is too late.,4
105814,good class,5
105815,The deep insight about the problems and innovative solutions to them which Prof. Sachs talked about are commendable. The course equipped me with all the basic knowledge which I can use in my further studies.,5
105816,Highly recommended!,5
105817,Very exciting course,5
105818,A course which should be part of the curriculum of every school and college.,5
105819,Great Course!,5
105820,A fascinating course and a great introduction to the concept of sustainable development. Highly recommended.,5
105821,"Highly pertinent subject matter. Material was slightly repetitive. Overall, highly recommended.",4
105822,Prof Sachs provides a detailed view on Sustainable Development that is both educational but also scary. This course shows us that we need to do more and that we have a long way to go in ensuring sustainable development.,5
105823,"The course itself is excellent. I just wished they got rid of the zooming in on graphs. Also, there is some issues with making the quizzes depend on web links that change over time.",5
105824,highly recommended,5
105825,Great course. It´s change my mind about sustanaibility,5
105826,One of the most enlightening online classes I've yet experienced,5
105827,Excellent introduction to the basic concepts and background data about sustainable development.,4
105828,This is an exceptional course and I would like to thank both Professor Sachs and Coursera for offering it! It is both a pleasure and an honor to have been able to learn so much and a limited period of time.,5
105829,"Excellent course, well rounded and each section compliments the learnings of others. Thank you so much Jeffery for providing this to us for free.",5
105830,"I like a lot when in the tests you have to search in a graph, it really let you know where to search some informations and also to know how other countries are in that area or situation.",5
105831,"This course was absolutely fantastic, I cannot say enough good things about it! I could go on and on about the wonderful things about it but I would rather keep this short and to the point: if you are reading this review, take this course!",5
105832,"Very interesting, with really good material and actual lectures.",5
105833,"Very impressive course, the lectures and assignments are very well organized and are quite interesting.It is very important topic for everybody in today's world.I hope a lot of people are encouraged to take this course, so everybody can start contributing to changing our world for the better.",5
105834,"I really enjoyed how expert Professor Sachs is on sustainable development. He seems to know a lot about the subject and we can see a spark on his eyes when he is teaching. Moreover, the lectures and quizzes are comprehensive and well organized.However, apart from the last Week, I think that solutions for the many problems that Professor Sachs presents are not showed properly. Although there are many issues unsolved, there may be a lot of good examples throughout the world to be presented together with these issues.Kind Regards,Rodolfo",4
105835,A great overview of a very complicated topic. Dr. Sachs does a great job presenting the information in easily digestible bits but still keeps it interesting.,4
105836,Great Course. The only bad thing is that in the end the course does not provide a certification.,5
105837,"It's a really good course and it is very complete. It gathers a lot of issues and it shows the principle problems and the possible solutions to each one. Besides, Prof. Sachs gives an humanitarian approach with which I fully agree. The only recommendation I have is to give an accomplishment certificate because it´s a very long course and we have to put a lot of effort to finish it.",5
105838,A great introduction to the subject of Sustainable Development!Prof. Sachs talks very slowly which makes it very easy to follow and understand. I personally liked to watch the videos at a higher speed though.,4
105839,"It was very informative, one could discuss and compare the situation in different countries in politics.The course was oriented to America and especially to New York, where the Professor is working, but it also gave me a very good overall look on the global situation.Thank you very much for the great course!",5
105840,"the course is of immens use for the whole world as the globlisation in all spears of human activitieshas taken place . People and many small governments are unaware of the impact of the development in different spears of its state activities such as economics, social and environment etc. This course with its solutions and applications for , will help the human habitations on this Earth will make living worth for every one The Paris Aggriment is really a triumph for the human race on this earth, this course will definatly will make us understand the shared objectives to end poverty, establish peace and ensure a life of dinity and opportunity for all.",4
105841,"This is a greatly comprehensive course about sustainable development. Prof. Sachs addressed many crucial situations and urgent problems that we face with today regarding global economic growth, environmental sustainability and social inclusion. He not only analysed their causes, but also provided well-thought, heartfelt solutions based on large amount of interdisciplinary studies. I am positively influenced by the wisdom and compassion presented in the course.The design of assignments is conducive to learning and encourages me to explore pertinent resources in the field of sustainable development. The assignments themselves are informative and resourceful.Learning this topic through the course has broadened my perspectives about the world I live in and has shed light on my own path as where to go for the best as a biologist, and first of all, as a human being. THANKS!!",5
105842,Very enlightening course thus far. The format is perfect,4
105843,This is a very engaging course that almost feels like a documentary. You end up learning a great deal and it is very effective in sparking interest in the subject.,5
105844,"This course proves to be very informative, and the quizzes push to discover new sources for course material. However, it is highly focused on the programs set by the UN and could provide more solutions and feedbacks on what is being done. Very much oriented toward public policies. Good experience overall.",4
105845,"I've only recently been going in depth into issues like harming the environment, poverty and solutions to those problems that don't affect us in bad ways and this course has helped deepen my understanding of the way everything works tremendously. The professor is a wonderful speaker and there isn't one boring minute. Each lesson is very well thought out and i would recommend this to anyone and everyone seeking to better understand how the connections in this modern world work and affect each other and effects on the environment if we keep on this destructive path of ours.",5
105846,Ive learnt so much about the world in general:),5
105847,A must for Everyone.,5
105848,Excellent!! Loved it,5
105849,"A course that helps you reflect on the mankind's contemporary and future challenges. This course warns the mankind to change its trajectory for its own good. After completing this course, I wonder why many governments are oblivious to serious threats that endanger homo-sapiens and decided to do what I can do within the sphere of my influence to save our beautiful planet ""Earth"". Thank you Dr. Sachs!",5
105850,Awesome course. One of the best here in Coursera.,5
105851,"Great course, you must take it for your own sake. It is hard to put your foot into one's shoes, it's hard to imagine what poverty is and social issues related to that if you never been to low income countries. But as a citizen of earth society we have to imagine future including rest of us. Because Sustainable Development will not continue when our economy and society are not sustainable. Everybody is responsible for future now.",5
105852,Love it! Very interesting and inspiring!,5
105853,"A truly amazing course! Throught it you actually gain awareness on problems and conflict that all of us, as human beings, should adress.I want to deeply thanks to the Prof. Jeffrey Sachs and all the staff for this magnific project.",5
105854,Great course. Gives great ideas in the path I will follow...,5
105855,"The Age of Sustainable Development is by far the most informative course I have encountered on the complex and pertinent subject of sustainable development. Professor Sachs takes the time to fully explore many of the key themes that form the foundations of sustainable development and simplifies sophisticated topics into digestible pieces of insight. This course is a must for anyone involved in sustainable development and should be prescribed viewing for politicians, CEOs and future leaders.",5
105856,It is very helpful to now about sustainable development,5
105857,This has been a fantastic course. I learned a lot. I am happy because of it although i would like to have a certificate. Thanks so much Profe Sach. You are amazing.,5
105858,"Excellent course, comprehensive material, good classes!",5
105859,"The course provides basics of Sustainable Development in a comprehensive way. Easy to understand and follow, rich with examples, and interesting content.",5
105860,Awesome course. Jeffrey Sachs' understanding and eloquence to decipher and explain the new challenges arising from the unprecedented occurring and upcoming changes is just ineffable.Recommended to anyone wanting to know more about this new approaching era of sustainable development,5
105861,Full of the diverse sub topics about sustainable development the course is pretty good in motivating you to consider this astounding subject that sadly requires a let's say continuation to allow you to make every thing that is discussed part of your life.,5
105862,"Lots of quality conversational information on sustainable development, but I wish there were more interactive projects to apply the concepts. Without an application, much of the information remained abstract and hard to remember.",4
105863,"Very interesting and demanding course, however is very long (14 weeks) in comparison to other online courses and due to its length it should provide a certificate of completion.",4
105864,excellent course for any social and political activist of any country,5
105865,"Very good course, I enjoyed it very much and appreciated the educated and polite style of Prof. Jeffrey Sachs. I would have appreciated a copy of the figures and grafique shown. The course release in 2012 would need to be updated. The Quizz need a real involvement of the student to be completed; challenging but I personnaly appreaciated very much. The Quizz would need some profound revision since some links are not available anymore and some answer are simply wrong. A Statement from the Columbia University / Prof. J. Sachs would have been welcome since completing the 14 week course imply a real involvement from the student. Overall very appreciated course, Thank Prof. Sachs!",3
105866,It is a perfect course!Special thanks to Prof. Sachs.,5
105867,A course that every citizen of the world will find absolutely amazing! Excellent and well-structured content easy to understand and comprehend.,5
105868,"Excellent course! 4 stars though, instead of 5, for the lack of minimum certification.",4
105869,"great leaning experience, as a student of development studies i found this course very significant for me.this course help me out ,how to set my approach in a certain development program.thank you so much ,coursera, Columbia University, and last but not the least PROF SACHS..to give me opportunity to learn this course from my home town.",5
105870,"Great course! Very comprehensive and instrumental, highly recommended!",5
105871,"Excellent programme. Basic introduction of concepts like Gross Domestic Product and Purchasing Power Parity, presented in a relaxed way along with video footage.Definitely worth your time.",5
105872,A real eye opener. Very informative. Professor Sachs has covered the most fundamental issue of our generations in a very analytical way and provided us all the facts/reasons to think differently for sustainable growth.,5
105873,"Amazing course in which you learn loads of things from social to environmental topics (even geographical knowledge). Professor Sachs is an enthusiastic one and you will learn in a fun and entertaining way. One of the best things to me is the websites you will visit during the course. So, enroll in it and enjoy!",5
105874,Wonderful course. Everyone should take this it.,5
105875,Interesting....I strongly recommend it.,5
105876,Great production and course quality. Highly recommended,5
105877,An enlightening and valid course for learning in sustainable development. I strongly recommend the course.,5
105878,I've opted for this course as a continuation to the Introduction to Sustainable Development and I am glad I did. Very well explained and structured for easy understanding. Thank you!,5
105879,Excellent course covering important aspects of Sustainable Development.,5
105880,"Extremely happy to be taking this course with such a knowledgeable professor, Jeffrey Sachs!",5
105881,"Absolutely wonderful. The Universidad de Columbia and especially professor Jeffrey Sachs made an amazing revision of the history, the data and the concepts of Sustainable Development, as the biggest ideas, the biggest challenge of our time. Interesting, compressible, interactive, this was a great experience for me and I´m sure for everyone.",5
105882,its a great course very important for my career,5
105883,"At first, i didn't know what to expect; i thought it was going to be pretty hard, because of my lack of experience in that specific area. It turns out that every lesson is perfectly explained,the quizzes are not easy tough!Highly recommended!",5
105884,Great view over the big challenges of today and the future.Excellent explaint and a lot of information about the history and the reasons of our problems on planet earth...Gives you a profound knowledge how we should manage the future to have a better life for everyone.,5
105885,"Overall, the course is outstanding, bringing together diverse threads of Global Health, Climate Change, Economics, International Politics/Relations and more into a cohesive explanation of our current world challenges standing in the way of living together on this planet for a long time to come without our current inequalities and threats to life itself. I've recommended it to all my friends and colleagues and I recommend it to anyone who reads my review. It's a time investment, but well worth every second I spent.",5
105886,Very best one.,5
105887,It is wonderful course. Whey the Columbia University offer a certificate it will be a Five star course.,4
105888,"I am a doctoral student in economics and political science. I had read Professors Sachs book, The End of Poverty, when I was in high school. I decided to take a basic course out of curiosity. While I belief the course is very basic and somewhat long, it does a wonderful job at introducing The Age of Sustainable Development. A light course, but provides a solid foundation for those who are interested in the topic!",5
105889,"This course has been wonderfully informative. I have enjoyed the structure, content and pace of this course and always look forward to the next video. This course is essential for understanding the complex issues facing our World today.",5
105890,Love it. Proff Sachs did not put me to sleep and that is a good thing!! Made me eager to learn.,4
105891,"Jeffrey Sachs is a great professor who talks in a very clear and concise way. The terminology and even the math parts are all really understandable. The exercises are really useful because they introduce you to a range of tools on the web such as World Bank data and the Human Development Index, AND teaches you how to use it. This course helps you to get a really well-rounded, complete picture of what Sustainable Development contains and looks at it from multiple perspectives.",5
105892,"Its such a privilege to have the opportunity to learn from Prof. Sachs videos. He's captivating in the ways he transmits his knowledge making such a complex subject understandable and accesible to ""normals"".",5
105893,"I really enjoyed this course. Very fluid, well organized and well-present.In my opinion, quizzes should not contain questions referring to the book, because not everyone (like me) can afford buying it.I would enjoy if Prof. Sachs could go deeper in the topics and explore them a little bit more and make student´s job a little bit more difficult.",4
105894,"It gives a well based numeric approach to sustainable development, but fails to approach some subjects from an ethical point of view. At some time, Prof. Sachs points out a few numeric indicators that favor economic development, but when talking about reaching these numbers, he offers more than debatable ways.",3
105895,"Dr Sachs is amazing and every person who plans on living on this planet should really pay attention. Together, we can find the solutions but we first have to have a full understanding of our challenges. Brilliant course and never boring! Thanks.",5
105896,"It's a very interesting and fun course. I think maybe it's too long for not giving a certificate, but it's a nice course to follow and to learn by even if you just do 10 minutes per day and take it as a personal experience",4
105897,"I havent finished yet, so far has been very good.",5
105898,Very Informative course but without Certificate. After spending so much time and efforts it should provide a certificate .,2
105899,Perfect!,5
105900,I love how Sachs has given a comprehensive overview of all aspects of development. I LOVE this course!,5
105901,"Professor Sachs is extremely knowledgeable, and explains everything in perfect detail. He is an excellent teacher. This class has opened up my mind and heart to the problems and solutions of sustainable development in the 21st century. Thank you Coursera for offering this extremely important educational opportunity.",5
105902,"The content is good. The delivery of lectures can be more engaging, with aid of visuals to illustrate and emphasize important concepts.",4
105903,It's very interesting course and it simply explains you the goals of sustainable development by mentioning the problems that the 3rd world countries are facing !!,5
105904,Eye opening and motivating.....Go out and make this world a better place!,5
105905,a complete learning experience.,5
105906,"A very complete view of sustainable development, from all kind of perspectives from global development goals to fighting the poor and from climate change to sustainable food production.",5
105907,This course is a pure knowledge. I have attended several courses and this course is simply amazing.,5
105908,Its very important to know what sustainable development is and knowing it makes a change in society.,4
105909,"This course is wonderfully and engagingly taught by the great Jeffrey Sachs, with a lot of food for thought, excellent visual aids, relevant data and statistics, and supplementary readings which add a lot to the course. The quizzes not only test the knowledge found in the lectures, but ask the students to analyze other data from sources such as the UN and World Bank. Overall, a holistic and information-packed introduction to the field of sustainable development.",5
105910,A Marvelous Course,5
105911,"Excellent course, no one can remain the same after watching it",5
105912,A truly excellent course,5
105913,Very interesting and well delivered content. Occasional links expired,4
105914,"The course covers various topics about sustainability from different perspectives beginning from what is sustainability, who and what get impacted, what is being done and what can be done to ensure sustainable economic development and various other aspects.I highly recommend this course to every one, for a well encapsulated curriculum and for great awareness.",4
105915,"Great overview of the fascinating world of sustainable development. It not only covers the definition and trends of the problems we face, but also the progress and challenges we are facing in alleviating these issues.",5
105916,so good!! just wish this sort of topic was compulsory in the school curriculum,5
105917,"I liked this course very much, especially because it was clear and well explained. During the lessons I could see how much efforts and passion Professor Sachs puts on this topic, which helped a lot in following the videos.There are just a couple of things I'd change: I'd give some material to read, mostly with graphs (it took some time to make the screenshot of each graph!). Moreover, I'd give a State of accomplishment at the end.",5
105918,One of best courses,5
105919,Too many weeks - it's the biggest problem for me,4
105920,This course is pretty much what i expected from an online course. I just rate it with four stars because:1. Quiz questions are often just about interpreting world bank data and not about the contents of the course.2. Having read Prof. Sachs book the course does not offer additional insights.,4
105921,Amazing journey to understand sustainable development!,5
105922,I am enjoying the lectures and really mind-opening insights in addressing global issues.Highly recommendable for those who work at the Development Sector.,5
105923,very interesting course,5
105924,Great structure and content. Very knowledgeable lecturer as well.,5
105925,"In this course there is a lot of valuable information, well prepared lessons and readings. I would try to make quizzes more complicated.",4
105926,"Excellent, well thought out and presented lectures. Very important subject. Excellent class.",5
105927,What a wealth of knowledge to learn at our own convenience.,5
105928,"Thank you, Mr. Sachs! The course is great.",5
105929,"Most pertinent course offered, teaching what the real problems of our time are. Can't recommend this course or his book enough.",5
105930,Learning chapter after chapter ! The videos are amazing and the quality of data and they way it is exposed is really good !,5
105931,Lucky to listen a valuable lecture by one of the most famous economist. :),5
105932,Lovley course!!! Can't get enough of it!,5
105933,"Probably, this is my most favorite course in Coursera.",5
105934,"A great way to understand the basics surrounding sustainable development. Accessible to all, but also insightful. Prof. Sachs does a brilliant job!",5
105935,So much real-world information. It changed my perceptions.,5
105936,I enjoyed the class. I can not thank Prof. Sach enough for this excellent offering.,5
105937,"Changed my life, best course I've ever taken!",5
105938,Very comprehensive. I am an economist and I have studied in one of the best universities of Brazil. I can say that the cultural and geographical analysis of the developments of countries are frequently neglected.,5
105939,"This is an excellent course, we learn a lot about sustainable development and global issues.",5
105940,"Excellent Course! There're so many things we should to know, in order to make a better world, we're still on time to change what has been made wrong, there's a planet to save, there's a task for doing...Let's start now!",5
105941,copious. thoroughly enjoying it so far,5
105942,Useful for business risk analysis and modeling complex problem.,4
105943,very watered down,1
105944,"It was an interesting insight. Especially for beginners I would recommend it. Is also suits the previous courses well (Fundamentals of Quantitative Modeling and Introduction to Spreadsheets and Models). I study finance and economics, so it was a bit too basic though. The Excel features are nice though and something that you would use yourself so easy.",4
105945,Mostly useful practical advice and examples on how to use Excel to model risks and realities. Week 3 was not very good as it was a quick overview of basic statistics which is incomprehensible if you have no previous knowledge and useless if you do.,3
105946,Basic Course.,3
105947,Great course and with lots of techniques for modeling in Excel,4
105948,"Great course, thanks",5
105949,Well taught. The material and exams were challenging but well aligned. Best to playback at 1.25-1.5 though.,4
105950,"Material was very well presented. Week 3 was challenging, but taking time to print out the slides, work through them rigorously proved very helpful. I found all sections very, very informative.",5
105951,Very Knowledgeable content and easy to understand.,4
105952,"WEEKS 1, 2, and 4 were AWESOME and had great information. Weeks 1,2, and 4 were very detailed and successfully communicated in a manner where an audience with or without a specialty in statistics can easily follow the logic, understand the purpose and think of how these tools/lessons can be applied in the varying worlds of risk, compliance, algorithms, and finance.I cannot say the same for week 3. Sadly, out of the whole certificate program it was this was the week I was most interested in (e.g. Goodness of Fit and identifying the Distribution of one's data) but, felt the week was poorly communicated, not supplemented with sufficient (if any) examples that one could tie into the real world, did not provide sufficient excel formulas, explanations, visuals or examples.",5
105953,Instructors demonstrate a clear understanding of the subject matter and communicate the methods clearly.,5
105954,"Nice course, probably the best so far in this specialization. I really enjoyed Sergei Savin's lectures - they were simple & clear. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for Senthil Veeraraghavan's lectures -he tried to explain an introductory 2-3 months statistics course in just one hour-absolute failure. I definitely recommend the course but I would like to see some improvements in the future sessions with more examples on excel instead of reading mathematical formulas from ppt files.",4
105955,"A very useful practical course, thanks a lot!",5
105956,Great experience and good content,5
105957,perfect and free,5
105958,"Good practical examples of the concepts. In general, seems to me that the courses of the specializations do not fit together well. At times, basic things mentioned elsewhere are repeated, some others are not explained sufficiently.",3
105959,well versed and beautifully designed,5
105960,Loved this course. Very much related to real life case scenarios.,5
105961,Please allow Prof. Sergey to take this course. Week 3 was crap because the instructor gave no real-world examples to push home the concepts he was propagating and his english is really hard to comprehend as well.,4
105962,THANK YOU!,4
105963,Professor Senthil ruined Week 3 with no explanation and reading exactly the same story from the slides. Rest course is interesting and engaging. Thanks.,4
105964,Simple but effective...,5
105965,Nice course. But's it's a bit too simple.,4
105966,"This was a great course; very good explanations teoretical and practice, you gave us powerful tools to analyze data and took the necesary time for cover the topics. Maybe you can add in the future some exercises that we have to upload for review among each other students. Thank you very much for share this tools and your knowledge.",4
105967,Fantastic Course - Thank you very much!,5

105976,Useful and mind-open,5
105977,Basically i resume of economics concepts that can be taken for granted as a prerequisite of the course,2
105978,4.5 stars actually. Good overview of modeling risk.,4
105979,The course covers important statistical concepts pertaining to risks and explains the interpretations and calculation in details. A must do.,5
105980,Re-watching these videos months after completing the course! Fantastic!,5
105981,Learn a lot!,5
105982,This one was not easy but interesting,5
105983,the examples were really helpful and easy to understand,5
105984,It is great.Teaches how it can be actually done in Excel without SAS & R.,5
105985,Excellent thoughts and concepts presented.,5
105986,"The distributions were not well explained, it could have been handled in a much better way!",1
105987,Very useful course especially the last part: Balancing Risk and Reward Using Simulation,5
105988,Great content! My only suggestion would be a more in-depth course over a 2 or 3 month period (with the price adjusted accordingly).,4
105989,"Top notch instructors. Very organized. Materials were outstanding, especially the simulations. Enjoyed this class very much.",5
105990,Very interested topic and very useful toolkits were introduced in this course. Highly re,5
105991,Really excellent,5
105992,This course is much more informative than the previous two in my opinion. I liked the sample spreadsheets provided. I still however feel the price is a bit steep compared to other similar courses you can find online. The quizzes aren't that challenging and it may be nicer to expand the assignments to practice more.,3
105993,"So far, it looks great!",5
105994,"Outdated presentation style: mostly ""voice behind text and Excel window"" long... long videos.I'm not questioning the material itself, but I was heavily bored during the course.",3
105995,"Excellent course. Great and useful examples given by instructors. Also, very helpful that editables files used in examples are available for students.",5
105996,Fantastic course! Thank you Wharton!,5
105997,"Some good sections of the course, but others are not explained well at all. Overall valuable material",4
105998,"Wonderful Course, I love it;Professional Teachers, I like them;i will keep learning!my next course is Corporate finance, hope i could pass and be certified.Best RegardsSophia",5
105999,This is very meaningful.,4
106000,Lack practical aspect analysis. Most of the materials are more theoretical (some of the graphs are not necessary and does not help understanding the discussing topic and increases confusion. Eg: Lorenz curve.) Really enjoyed and learned a lot from the case study from reality. Highly recommend increase real-life case study materials.,3
106001,The English translation into simple Chinese is not very good. I missed the meaning of words or sentences from simple Chinese.,4
106002,It is Great Course. I got I expected and also what I did not expect but important.,5
106003,Learned a lot by this course!,5
106004,Introducing a whole picture of marketing and its basics. Easy to understand and catch up.,4
106005,Liked the course a lot - Prof. Mike Useem's lectures are like stories - thats why they work!,5
106006,The course has really enlightened me on managing social and human capital. Kudos to the course instructors,5
106007,Appreciate this added module to address the people side of business.,5
106008,Great view of managing employees from a human perspective.,4
106009,"The course was very well planned with a good number of examples to make the concepts easy to understand. The professors gave a very smooth presentation of the topics given. Even the tests at the end of each week made me go through the all the topics taught through out the week. I would suggest anyone and everyone to enroll for this course as it is not specific to the needs of a specific industry, rather it is a necessity for all members of the working population to understand the way to manage human and social capital.",5
106010,Great course for learning how the social and human capital works! Excellent Faculty and teaching!Many Thanks to Prof. Peter Cappelli and Prof. Michael Useem,5
106011,No structure for the course,2
106012,"Great Course, very insightful and in so many ways also common sense. Thank You!",5

106014,Fantastic Course to understand & Manage People Capital !,5
106015,Professor Capelli and Professor Useem laid out a very stimulating conversation through the lectures. Things that I learned will stay with me forever. Learning from real life examples made more sense. Highly recommend to anyone who is looking for an quick guidance to Managing Social and Human Capital.,5
106016,nice course with good mtrl,5
106017,"Very Good Course, but 3rd lesson was incomplete and the missing section was not addressed by coursera.",4
106018,Concepts are explained in a lucid way! Brilliant.,5
106019,This is just a dream course for an entrepreneur. Their are lot of challenging topics clarified by wonderful examples.,5
106020,A Terrific course,5
106021,"Amazing course! I learned a lot and I totally recommend it,",5
106022,Valuable case studies and excellent walk-through by the professors.,5
106023,I think more examples would have been better for the class.,3
106024,very low length to content ratio; basic content,1
106025,"5 points out of 5 for professor Peter. 1 point out of 5 for professor Mike. The first 2 weeks were good as professor Peter presented with very brief and sum up the ideas. On another hand, the last 2 weeks were bad, professor Mike didn't do well in term of summary. He spent 70% for introduction of each topic before reaching to the points that he want to make. Most of the time, he didn't make any points. Plus he didn't answer the questions that he asked. I am disappointed. I was expecting to learn more as the course structure was impressive BUT the actual lectures are not covered the topic.",2
106026,Excellent course for Management! Thanks to the Professors and their case studies!,5
106027,Incredible course. The material taught and discussions held where practical and applicable to the real world situation today.,5
106028,"Great Course, I'd enroll over and over again. Thanks to our amazing professors",5
106029,Great course ! thoroughly enjoyed the content and examples from various industries,5
106030,The teachers made the course really interesting an,5
106031,"Excellent course, I love it!, it has been very useful for my carries as a Lighting Designer to understand the light and how it Works, which let me do better designs for theater and concerts.",5
106032,I'm not a teacher but I took this course to gain a better understanding on how light works to try and use it to create original visual designs since I'm a graphic designer. It's just great how This Course has been arranged to be so short and simple even for non-teachers.,5
106033,"This is what science learning is about, a 'thing' as light we take for granted explained and parasitized in accessible well structured way. Talk about it, wonder about it and especially...Do it. I gave it a 4 star rating, five would be perfect, w've learned that nothing is perfect and can be improved... maybe this is.",4
106034,"I love the activities! The results from these experiments are wild. I would have liked a section of this course for lecture, since I enrolled for knowledge not only activities and strategies, but observing these activities was simply amazing.",4
106035,"I can't even make pre-course survey, which couldn't have wrong answers",1
106036,"i'm the whole constitution lil' July 4, 1776. 21 st century realization moment.",5
106037,"This class is by far the best online class I have ever taken, and I recommend everyone to take it so they can become engaged with and understand the American Constitution.",5
106038,The Professor is very knowledgeable and very passionate about the subject! I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in law or politics.,5
106039,Awesome!! Even for a History major like myself it was incredibly thought provoking and extremely well taught. I only wish every American received this level of instruction on The Constitution.,5
106040,"I attempted to take this course because I really wanted to learn more about the US Constitution and how it applies to my daily life. I made it to week three before I could no longer keep listening to Professor Amar drone on and turn a 10 minute lecture into a 25 minute lecture with filler words, tangents and lack of structure. Professor Amar is very knowledgeable about the Constitution and I don't doubt his credentials or accomplishments. However, with out an outline, slides, notes, structure... something... anything... this class is just a talking head that is painfully hard to pay attention to. If you're an auditory learner and prefer the old school, pretentious, Ivy League lecture hall format this is the class for you.",1
106041,"It is not five stars for just one reason: it think it could be better if having not so long video. Please, professor Amar split the 22minutes/31minutes videos in small portions.Notwithstanding, it was amazing and inspiring to know how democratic the American Constitution creation process was. Unfortunately, because the socialism and communism influence in our country we do not have much information about everything which have to do with American history and culture.You American people would be proud their history and take care to things go on at the same way.",4
106042,A very wonderful course.,5
106043,"excellent review of the content, intentions, and context behind the language of the Constitution, including the amendments. I really enjoyed it.",4
106044,An excellent course for anyone wanting to delve into this subject. Thank you to Professor Amar and Coursera for making it possible!!,5
106045,"I would like to congratulate Professor Amar by course ministrated , it opened my eyes to the logic of American's constitutional law and how historical and political events influenced directly in building of this country. I live in Brazil and sometimes fundamental premises settled in US law are discussed, not always understood by the depth and intensity that this course presented . It was gratifying to realize how important concepts to the world were signed by the Founding Fathers of the United States of America. And much congratulate the explanations and enthusiasm of Professor Amar to share his vast knowledge with clarity and sympathy. Thanks.Priscila C. Fernandes.",5
106046,"Thank you for educating me on America's Written Constitution! I am from Canada, and an avid history buff, so am following the 2016 election with baited breath. The second amendment is constantly mentioned by the players in the election, so I thought I should learn all about the amendments and how they were written, and in what context. After taking this course my friend from New York said I should take the american Civic test to see if I could pass. I took the test and after 2 tries I passed with 90%. It made me realize how there are most likely a large majority of American citizens who do not know the constitution at all, and the history in which it was created from. I agree with the professor in that this document changed the world. And as I watch the world news of the day, I am thankful that it was written and that I live in a part of the world that has democracy, flawed as it is, it at least gives some voice to the people. I highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn and understand American history.",5
106047,Great!,5
106048,Love it. Exciting and clear and concise. Bravo....,5
106049,"Even with a few bumps in the coursework, I felt the information was interesting, enlightening and I appreciated the time I put into the class - it was not wasted. I will certainly be a better classroom teacher for having taken the class, and I look forward to the next ""Unwritten"" class as well.",5
106050,This is an excellent course and I would recommend it to an,5
106051,"Interesting topic, but the course is not organized well. Sometime the professor gives us a good lecture with lots of interesting details, sometimes he's just rambling.",3
106052,"Absolutely amazing professor and course. Fast, but in-depth and very resourceful.",5
106053,im beginning to like this course the professor is very good at making the study of the constitution lively,4
106054,Excellent Course with extremely detailed lectures.,5
106055,great course. well taught.,5
106056,This is a great class and the lectures are very interesting. I hope to have time to finish these in the near future.,5
106057,"Of the three courses I have completed I have enjoyed this one the most and Professor Akhil Amarkept me interested all the way through in a subject I knew so little about, I look forward to studyingthe Unwritten Constitution in the New YearThank you very much for allowing me to study this",5
106058,Amazing exploration of one of the most important democratic constitutions in the world.,5
106059,A really amazing introduction to the US Constitution.,5
106060,Started a tad late but the class is great. We have a very good professor and his dialect is perfect.,5
106061,This course was a great introduction to the United States Constitution. The material was given sufficient lecture time to allow you to grasp the information and it was not rushed through.,4
106062,The instructor just rambles on and on... there is no structure to the lectures.,1
106063,Unfortunately there is no involvement academic staff so there is no assistance/support. The course is put out there and students are left to their own devices. The calibre of students is poor and informed discussions non-existent. A great pity because the content on occasion is interesting.,2
106064,This course is a fantastic tool to understand the principles that bind the American society since the begining of its existence. I feel very honored to complete this marvelous MOOC. Thank you all for the opportunity.,5
106065,"I was very disaappointed by this course, in fact a bit more so than by the ""Unwritten"" course that has run concurrently with this one. I was **very** put off by the professor's simply opening his book and trying to remember what he'd said there and then, in front of his audience, reduce it down to a videoed talk. He needed to put some effort and thought into understanding his topic from the point of view of an audience that is inevitably very, very different from the one he had in mind (if any, in particular) as he was writing the book. If he didn't have time for proper preparation, he should have found another medium for flogging his publications.By and large, everyone who is from the US (I'm not) and who teaches about the US constitution emphasizes its uniqueness. Indeed, they have a point: it was the first (and, admirably, the shortest) modern written constitution. However, uniqueness isn't unique among nations; all nations are somehow unique. Undertanding a nation (including thir constitution) has to involve looking at both hum-drum normality as well as uniqueness. I felt that the course would have been more substantial if it had been built on the obvious fact that the US revolutionaries were ""Englishmen fighting for an Englishman's rights."" And, indeed, what they created had both the worst and the best traits that England's historical jurisprudence offered. Social stare decisis has been a major stumbling-block not only for common-law countries but as well for countries that follow other sorts of jurisprudence.The course was embarrassingly bad.",2
106066,"Prof. Amar.approach of historical and chronological approach was an interesting study in contrast to others at unique to everything else out there. It was an excellent time to be reading with the resignation Speaker of the House, during the Pope's visit. The colonial soldiers marching in front of the white house welcoming the Pope, a reminder of the established values by the founding establishment A great time to be a descendant from the original Reformed Church of America and a stranger to people like the Pope.",5
106067,Got started late but has been very informative with lots of surprises I thought I knew more than I did.,4
106068,"This was a wonderful course & Professor Amar made it both informative and enjoyable. The only problem I had was that the sound was just too low. I had to put my computer audio on 100% and it was still not up to conversation or lecture level. Thank you, Professor Amar, for a very interesting course.",5
106069,"Professor is difficult to follow, often repeating himself and adds fluff that can often be a waste of time",2
106070,Very useful information and resourceful for on-line teaching.,4
106071,very informative and useful,5
106072,"Excellent course. The best part about it was that there was so much material available to learn about various aspects of teaching online, so there was always opportunities to get a deeper understanding of things. Self-directed, self-paced, and well-organized. I really enjoyed taking this course.",5
106073,Very easy to follow. As an independent learner - I could do so without feeling the obligation of posting on a forum.,5
106074,I thoroughly enjoyed the course as it helped put a lot of learning (that I have had on the job) in proper perspective. I specifically enjoyed the off platform activities.,4
106075,I thoroughly enjoyed this course. Great resources & the course progression was very well laid out. Thank you!,5
106076,"Some great material, and really valuable insights to the skill of teaching on line. Highly recommended for anyone with an interest in on line teaching.",4
106077,I am loving this course! Never did I take an online course with this amount of support and extra reading to help me cope with the lack of face-to-face moments with a teacher. The reading suggestions so far are spot on and I already feel more comfortable with the course itself. They even guide us on how to evaluate better an online course.

Everything is five star about this course . The important sections for me was different learning tools, learning outcomes, engagement of the learners and assessment. The course is designed very nicely with small video, links to quality materials and peer review. Because of my busy schedule, i would mostly go through the course during my long travel to hospital. Thanks to Simon, Negin and UNSW team to have such a wonderful course. Thanks",5
106082,"A fantastic course!!! An incredibly substantial one, containing a multitude of useful links and recommendations. The latter are flexible, individual-oriented and depend on how familiar you are with certain aspects of online teaching and certain technical issues.

106155,Great course! Very interactive!,5
106156,"The course tightens back everything that was taught in the 3 previous courses. It helps me recall important information and reinforce my understanding of developing good lesson plans not only for daily but also weekly classes. The teachers, both instructors and teachers for observation sessions are fun, lively, and very helpful in conveying many useful take-away for my own class development.Thank you so much Dr. Shane and Ms. Jessica for producing such a high quality and helpful course!",5
106157,"The course gives you the opportunity to have a go at creating your own lessons. The first lesson I did was a bit amatour, but it gave me the confidence to make better lessons in the second specialisation. Thanks a lot to the creators!!!",5
106158,thank you all .,5
106159,hard work to get to the promised land!!!,5
106160,"Very good experience, Thanks.",5
106161,great capstone to the course. Very clever and efficient way to incorporate the necessary hours of class observation in an online format!,5
106162,"There was more work put into this Capstone Project, but each assignment had a purpose and was thoroughly explained, modeled and ready for you, as the student, to create. Great way to grow and learn by teaching and doing!",4
106163,"This course allowed me to improve my methodcompletely, thank you infinitely.",5
106164,Much more time consuming than I anticipated. But I thought it was really good.,5

I am thrilled!!1",5
106169,A lot of work but an incredibly rewarding learning process. I'm very glad I took it.,5
106170,"I loved this specialization, it allows you to create a portfolio of work to show a potential employer while teaching you what and how to do it .",5
106171,"This course is a butt-kicker, but well worth the time spent. It forced me to get the hard stuff over with, and the feedback on got on my mini teaching demonstration was beyond helpful.",5
106172,A best Paltform to enhance your knowledge.,5
106173,I found this course easy to follow and informative.,5

106182,"This Capstone Project requires a lot of effort and time, but it is definitely worth it. Anyone who takes this course will learn so much at the end and he/she would be prepared to start teaching.",5
106183,Great course! Very instructive.,5
106184,"This is a wonderful and motivating course that teaches how to be a great teacher, using your own characteristics.",5

106189,"Challenging, but very useful!",5
106190,"It was nice to receive formative assessment through Capstone Project. Anybody interested in practicing what they've learned during the first three modules, Capstone Project is the course for them. I thoroughly enjoyed it!",5
106191,This one is more labor intensive than the other courses but worth it. I learned a lot.,5
106192,"Fantastic Observation opportunities. However, due to site issues, I had to skip, go back, and re-watch various pieces.",5
106193,"Hard work, but I feel that I am working for something and learning a lot.",5
106194,Absolutely exceptional and filled with tangible products that you can immediately use in building a credible portfolio/resume. It was a good bit of work but entirely worthwhile.,5
106195,I am so enjoying this offering! 100% the best learning experience that I have had to-date!! You guys are simply brilliant!!,5
106196,"I really like the course, there are many interesting things to improve our teaching practice. However I have found that it is not really easy to do it in the classroom.",4
106197,Great!!!,5
106198,Very good course,5
106199,Challenging and totally recommended!,5
106200,"A general test of the things learnt in the previous courses, quite comprehensive.",5
106201,I loved this course!,5
106202,"First I would like to thanks all my tutors at ""Teach English Now"" that have been so helpfull and have made this course specialization so interesting and rewarding for me because I have learnt many experiences and knowledge that I have never thought before. As a matter of fact there are not enough words to say how great and marvelous you have been with this course.",5
106203,Great project!,5
106204,Amazing course! Thanks for making this possible.,5
106205,"It was a nice experience, I really put in practice all topics that I learnt during the former three courses, although it was a lot of hard work, it's really worth of doing!",5
106206,This course was tough! It involved a lot of work but I learned a lot.,5
106207,A very helpful course especially for the people living in countries where we don't have access to the world class education,5
106208,Challenging and excellent!,5
106209,That's one of the best courses ever i passed. I strongly recomend to take the whole course for further learners. Good luck everyone who is going to take exactly these courses.,5
106210,The most useful course I have ever done!,5
106211,"The Capstone helped me to incorporate all the techniques absorbed in the previous three courses into my teaching technique. Doubtless, there are hundreds of aspects and peculiarities to master, but I did enhance my overall teaching mastery, having completed the Capstone.Verdict: Highly Recommended:)Best regards,Rafael DauletESL Teacher",5
106212,I have gain a lot .thank you very much,5
106213,It was an amazing course. I loved it.,5
106214,Fantastic course. It was an amazing experience and learned so much. Highly recommend for anyone to do this course as it really is an amazing journey with yr peers and instructors. You will really have built your confidence on completion.,5
106215,Awesome quite demanding but I guess quality standarts are intertwined... Great!,5
106216,This was the worst course I have taken with ASU on Coursera. Feedback was minimal and the system had many technical issues. Videos didn't start properly and there was no help or feedback from the instructors or the peers. I have wasted a lot of time resubmitting my assignments due to technical issues. Waste of my time.,1
106217,Very helpful and insightful!,5
106218,The entire course was not paced well. The capstone had as much work each week as the other courses had in the entire 6 week course. To make it worse for me the capstone came up at the end of the year when teachers are overloaded already. I ended up having to roll over to the next session 1/2 way through. Work should have been better spread out. I also do not like that you get no real teacher evaluation in a capstone. Meaning a student could take a full 8 courses over a year and then fail when the teachers finally look at all the work in the second capstone.,1
106219,The course provide intensive practice. After completing all of the assignments I feel myself more confident as a teacher.,5
106220,Great course! Really loved it! Keep up the good work with the course.,5
106221,"too repetitive, and i do not want to submit a video of my self teaching.",2
106222,It was a challenging task but I liked it. Thank you !!! I has been a pleasure!,5
106223,Highly recommend this course for ESL teachers! Puts to practice everything we learned in the previous courses!,5
106224,it's challenging but practical.,5
106225,I was expecting the capstone to be different than what it ended being. I didn't find it as practical and beneficial as the other courses.,2
106226,Demanding but worthy; brilliant and well organized!!,5
106227,"please be nice to Chinese mainland students, the net probelm, just like we can't use google in China, but we need to upload some assginments on it.",4
106228,"the timing was a problem, with part 2 starting before the planned end of part 1",4
106229,All the courses from the great Language teacher Dr. Shane Dixone are simply excellent !!!Recommending!,5
106230,it is worth doing,5
106231,"Nice, but demands hard work.",5
106232,"How I can continue the course, there is no subtitle in English.Finally i get solution.",5
106233,"Sadly, there only english subtitles in the first video, so I can´t continue the course",1
106234,"I learned a lot about the principles of Buddhism and Taoism, as well as Chinese medicine and the organs. It would've helped to have some English subtitles at the beginning though.",5
106235,Very Informative and Systematic course. From reasoning to conclusion are all great.Suggest for anyone who interested in Chinese Medicine.,5
106236,I am a student of Western Medicine，more and more found that TCM is interesting,5
106237,It said it was subtitled into English but that's only the first video...,1
106238,ONly in chinese. Not English subtitles.,1
106239,"Need more (understandable) subtitles. Peer-review for this course is not a good idea as well, given abstract concepts and different language.",1
106240,I have learned lots of Chinese tradition.,4
106241,The instructor looks nerves when he talking.,1
106242,"Very good course. By a stroke of luck, before taking this course, I took another course on 中华传统文化 which was a wonderful refresher for what I grew up with in my formative years.I am particularly hopeful that with an integrative holistic approach of Western and Eastern medical disciplines, people can learn to prevent getting sick, work with doctors to heal themselves with minimium side effects when they fall ill.It is very interesting to note that thousands of years ago, Chinese believe that people can live to 120!",4
106243,This course explains the cultural of Traditional Chinese Medicine in a very vivid way. It explores the hidder history and cultural behind the medicine and offers us helpful advices on how to lead a healthier life.,5
106244,Interesting topics that provide participants opportunities to reflect on the way they teach and how they can make their students the center of a class.,4
106245,Amazing course! It helped in a lot of ways being an ESL teacher here in China,5
106246,Hello!I'll recommend every teacher and trainer to do this course because it really helps in making teaching better and more productive.,5
106247,"From my owns perspective this course had helped me a lot, since it made me think that as a teacher I will learn forever.",5
106248,Good themes which brightened my way of learning to teach,5
106249,"Doing this course, was an opportunity for me to know why I should have a good knowledge about my learners and their learning.",5
106250,The African perspective was very interesting.,4
106251,During the lectures not all the slides were well revised and the peer assessments should include more specific guides.,4
106252,Another excellent course in this series. Assists reevaluating aspects of the teaching profession.,5
106253,Great course! I learned about how to approach multicultural classes.,5
106254,"A teacher who cares and knows how to express that. I liked the separation of the self assessment parts from the parts about the great pedagogs who have gone before. The academic duty of reverence of the great forbears is quite a separate activity from the understanding of the children in one's own classroom, even if the two activities feed each other.",5
106255,Really great course. Examines many important principles for engaging with students and transformative learning.,5
106256,"Although the topics are great and very interesting, especially because I am a teacher who face many of the situations mentiones, the videos are very hard to understand and I needed to put subscribe all the time.",2
106257,It's very useful.,5
106258,Fabulous course! I learned so much from this MOOC and would highly recommend it to anyone in education.,5
106259,Just great! It is practical and very didactic. Thanks!,5
106260,It is a well structured course with excellent contents for the beginner to learn and share knowledge of EduTech.,5
106261,"Hello! I´d like to let you know that I´m making the most of this course! SInce this is a two -way road I´m going to apply the resources and tools in class. I´ll let you know.Thank you so much!Cheers,Sandra GoronasArgentina",5
106262,"Very well structured, I as a vocational training school teacher miss examples for 17 to 22 year old students.",4
106263,This course has shown me new way to achieve what I have been struggling for months. It also give me methodology to improve myself and my teaching methods.,5
106264,"As a course on Web 2.0 Tools, I would suggest that the course also uses web 2.0 tools to engage the participants. It will give us hands on experience as a learner on how the tools can engage us.",4
106265,"I have learned many new tools that I never knew existed. These tools are useful and relevant as we are in the IT-Age and moving into ""Future Ready Schools""-format of teaching and learning. The tools will definitely be ignite interest to, not only students, but to teachers as well!",5
106266,"An excellent, well constructed course with clearly defined objectives. I learnt so much and thoroughly enjoyed the course. I have taken another course from the same department at University of Houston and I honestly can't sing the praises of this department loudly enough!",5
106267,Great course to learn about the various web tools for different purposes.,4
106268,Thank you for introducing me to so much Web 2.0 Tools.,4
106269,Very fun and great ways to understand various tools that can apply in our education sector.,5
106270,The course's online learning platform was convenient and easy to follow. The pace that the course goes at was ideal and the allowance to go ahead with later week's assignments was a good move - as it catered to my availability so i could finish the later week's assignment before i get busier with work and studies in the later part of the month.,4
106271,Free Tools for Interactive Classroom Learning,4
106272,The content is really good but the course has too much theory. Mixing it with some practical programming assignments would have been very nice,4
106273,"I think the course has very limited practical problems; so for beginners in NLP and text analytics, it is very difficult to grasp all the theoretical concepts presented in the course.",3
106274,While I did not do the assignments. The videos and explanations included were top notch!,5
106275,Very theoretical but very good. Well presented.,4
106276,Nice course and all the chapters are well explained.,5
106277,Very good course thank youI wish we could have use case applications with high level tools such as RThanks a lot again !,4
106278,This is a very good course. I think it provides a very good foundation of text mining and analytics like PLSA and LDA. More advanced research discussed in the last lecture is also very interesting.,4
106279,"Annoyingly, the specific pre-requisites can't be determined until AFTER enrolling. This course is in C++, so if you're not a C++ programmer, it's probably not a good idea to purchase this.",3
106280,"Excellent course, the pipeline they propose to help you understand text mining is quite helpful. It has an important introduction to the most key concepts and techniques for text mining and analytics.",5
106281,"The material of the course is very well organized, and presented. The examples and application use cased are interesting and clearly demonstrated. With Machine Learning background, it is very easy to understanding and grasp the theories, the althorithms and put them into practice. I highly recommend this course to anyone who has a ML background and would like to work on NLP problems.",5
106282,Very interesting! Thank you prof.,5
106283,"This course is a pretty good resource for full-time graduates who are doing research in Natural Language Processing, but not for other people who want to learn in part-time some concrete skills to resolve specific text mining problems.The course-style is heuristic-guiding based. Some questions are presented in lecturing or quiz, and answers are hardly found. So, some text books had better be specified.Homework of this course is quiz-based, only one optional programming task. It's easy to pass the course, but it's hard to master its content. As an application science area, more practical assignments should be provided, as can help students learn better.This is a 6-week open course teaching a complicated research area, Natural Language Processing, so most of its topic cannot be discussed in detail. However, this course could be designed and organized better.",3
106284,Could not understand many of the mathematical formulae involved. The topic coverage was good.,2
106285,Best NLP course that I saw.,5
106286,loved all the lectures,5
106287,Great!!,5
106288,Very comprehensive introduction to text mining. It serves well as a First Class to text mining and analytics!,5
106289,"I would recommend this course to everyone who wants to know much more about theoric part of text mining. For pratices, I'd recommend the data camp courses... I think the join of this platforms, could result in a better experience, because you can pratice the theorical knowledge gained here, regards =) !",5
106290,"the course is very helpful in giving the overall flavor of text mining and analytics. I would recommend to reduce the number of math work and focus on the conceptual level along with more application that could be used. For the math part, adding optional videos for more details about math will be very useful and helpful",4
106291,"Forums were poorly organized and not well participated in.There was no forum topic for the honors assignment.Honors assignment appeared to require unix, which was not stated in the course requirements.Honors assignment was due too early in the term.",2
106292,This was a great introduction to Text Mining and Analytics.,5
106293,"This is an excellent course that captures many different text mining techniques. It requires some math knowledge in numerical analysis and probability in order to understand the concepts.I gave 4 star rating due to 2 problems during the course:1) Lack of examples along the formulas and principles. There are some, but many concepts could be adopted much faster if examples were introduced right along with them.2) The optional programming exercises are easy to complete, but the environment is very confusing to set it up.",4
106294,"Too much theory, not enough practical exercises and too few examples of how the algorithms work.",2
106295,The coding assignment instructions are near impossible to follow. The lecture is monotonous in the later weeks.,3
106296,Good survey of techniques,4
106297,Excellent Module!A most know & understand unit for all students of Data Science. Enjoyed every aspect of the learning .. Good teaching !!!,5
106298,The course focuses more on the theoretical side with no practical examples. It also does not explain these theoretical concepts in detail enough. It was difficult for me as a new learner in the text analytics field to follow such dense theoretical concepts.,1
106299,Very good course! Thank you :),5
106300,Very practical. The lecture is easy to follow.,5
106301,"Very detailed, but taught in an easily understandable manner.",4
106302,"You need to pay to participate in the quizzes. Stay clear, there are free alternatives out there",1
106303,Excellent course for small to large arts organizations. The planning of the Cycle in your family will be an extra bonus to your sustainability!,5
106304,Highly recommended.,5
106305,Truly enjoyed this class and the topics covered. Being an Arts Administrator I found it extremely interesting to read and learn about other organizations.,5
106306,"A wonderful Course! I learnt a lot and I will implement all the elements into my organisation's strategy.Hasmik Movsisian, Music of Armenia.",5
106307,It's pretty good to take this course and get more idea and point of view for the management in arts and cultural organization. Many people love art but still believe paying for art is extravagant. However there are plenty people around the world enjoying art and know how to manage it for life.,4
106308,"Interesting and useful, but I doubt the certificate is worth it. Definitely audit it, though.",4
106309,"This course was incredibly informative. The resources provided were amazing and thorough. I enjoyed the pacing of time of when assignment were due, worked with my schedule. It was great that if you fell a bit behind, you could catch up. I enjoyed all of the organizations that talked about their experiences implementing the cycle. Just overall a wonderful course! Thank you very much for putting this together!",5
106310,"So appreciative of opportunities like this, available online for prospective arts administrators to learn about. Being someone who has read all of Michael Kaiser's books, this was a great opportunity to hear him discuss everything he's written and become known for in the arts world. Thank you to coursera.org for having this opportunity available!",5
106311,"Great course with a lot of hands on and practical information. I would not mind going into bigger detail. It will be a big effort to implement it in the company, but it will be worth it. Thanks for the course!",5
106312,Absolute clarity on arts management. Very straight forward.,5
106313,"This was the most helpful online course that I have ever participated in and I'd like to say that I'm honored and really happy about the new theory, which I have learned throughout the lessons.I really like the fact that you don't have peer assessed assignments, because I find them very time consuming and not helpful. Also every lesson was really well structured and easy to understand. The fact that almost each of them was shot during a real class is another plus for me, because when I have attended other courses most of the tutors just read and you can see their eyes moving while they are doing it and it really destroys my concentration.Something which I would like was to have more part of the book maybe. If you are afraid that a student might afterwards upload it in some torrent site you can build some platform where one wouldn't be able to download but only to read a certain document. I would have liked to receive the whole book like that and more written files.",4
106314,"Very important ground work, for further study. Invaluable!",5
106315,This was a very good introduction to a very interesting arts management tool. The practice cases with organisations from different countries and sectors were particularly useful to illustrate the theory in the course.,5
106316,My two favourite courses on coursera so far: the Dino 101 and the Theropod Dinos and the Origin of Birds :) thank you for a very thorough course - I've learned a lot!,5
106317,"The course was simply amazing. I am a Brazilian student of veterinary medicine with an special interst in birds. I love to watch and learn about them, and, if possible, I will work with the medicine and rehab of that incredible group of living dinosaurs. The course was extremely didactic and clear on all past information, making my interest only increase. Unfortunately I can not afford to buy the certificate, which makes me sad in a way. However, I am very grateful to the entire mini-course team and I congratulate you on the incredible work you have done.",5
106318,"This was a fantastic course, full of information and evidence.I loved the tutors. Very well presented and not complicated despite the subject matter.Do take this course.",5
106319,I am really enjoying this course,5
106320,Great course. I didn't knew it that Dinosaurs are still present in birds. Thank you University of Alberta & Coursera.,5
106321,One of the best courses that I've enrolled in.Remarkable in: it's enjoyable and funny. So good explanations!,5
106322,assume class... You explore a lot of dinosaurs. Including many weird newly discovered ones. Plus you explore the variety what characterizes different types of birds.,5
106323,Awesome course =),5
106324,"The course was an extensive and enjoyable overview of theropod dinosaurs and birds, thanks to the University of Alberta for making it!",5
106325,there is a lot I had to unlearn from PBS about Avian evolution. now I am hooked on their courses on dinosaurs and evolution.,5
106326,great experience!!! I learnt a lot!!!thank you for giving me the opportunity to enrich my knowledge!!!!,5
106327,Most informative! The course is well thought out and must have taken a great deal of time putting all together. Many thanksJim Morris,5
106328,"With Theropod Dinosaurs and the Origin of Birds MOOC I finally completed all Paleo Online Courses offered by University of Alberta. I enjoyed all Paleo MOOCs given their very interesting content and outstanding presentation, but I must say that Early Vertebrate Evolution was far the best one, in my opinion. It is also true to say that all University of Alberta MOOCs, as usual, provided first class lecture notes. I would like to thank all the personnel involved in developing and making available this amazing tool for propagating science and knowledge. And I would like to suggest standardizing the measuring unit system throughout all courses, because there is an interchangeable use of either imperial or metric, and since most of the world uses metric system, that could be a good way to go.",5
106329,A well executed course presented with light and entertaining style. Comprehensive for a Five week course and suited to a diverse student base. Enjoyable and I shall review the content frequently. I look forward to future UA paleontology courses.,5
106330,Great ending to the three Paleontology courses,5
106331,"A great course that offers a well-structured and insightful overview of the evolution of theropod dinosaurs into birds, presented in a wonderfully understandable way.",5
106332,"lots of fun, I wish it was a little more intensive.",5
106333,"This is my second course by University of Alberta (the first one was Dinosaurs 101) and it's great again. Looking forward for new courses (sauropods, please?)",5
106334,Awesome. Ivy league level.,5
106335,Brilliant! Turned my world up side down!,5
106336,Great course.,5
106337,"The University of Alberta has done an excellent job with this whole series of paleontology courses. The interactives are well designed, and the lectures and quizzes are interesting and memorable. I'm a fan and am looking forward to learning more!",5
106338,"I had such a great time taking this course.Is the second I take from the University of Alberta, I'm sure going to take them all.The classes are comprehensible, with well made videos, and written material that's great to study later on, or before you watch them.This written material frees a lot of time on the class, as I usually take notes when watching online courses, this let's me concentrate on watching the material without having to pause over, and over to write down what seems important.Thank you!",5
106339,Loved it. I wish there were a 10 minute review at the end where everything is pulled together in a meaningful and cohesive way with a summary of the key evolutionary paths from dinosaurs to modern birds. I will go back through all the course material to sketch this out for myself. It would be nice to have an overview/summary/chart to study from though. I'd like to memorize key points and some more signposts to help with that would be great.I finished the course in less than a week and loved every minute. I am left wanting more. P.S. I have a master's degree in biological sciences.,5
106340,Thank You University of Alberta for yet another wonderful course.,5
106341,good course！,5
106342,Simply superb.,5
106343,"Even if you've never had a lifelong fascination with natural history like I did, this course should be fascinating and educational enough to draw you in. Scott Persons is an amazing teacher: clear, concise, knowledgeable and passionate enough that you will never feel lost, learn a great deal and yet never feel bored. Philip Currie is also very informative. Highly recommended for anyone with even a modicum of interest in dinosaurs.",5
106344,Excelent course and instructors!,5
106345,Alberta University and Paleontology! What more needs saying?,5
106346,"The most informative biology course I've ever took. The course is well-structured, interesting, and covers all the important points. The course is directed toward non-professionals, anyone can take it, even if you know nothing about the topic.",5
106347,Stunning course,5
106348,Cool course I love birds and now understand about them more !!!!! Plus I can tell my friends want to see a Dino look over there !,5
106349,"This was a great introductory class and I learned a lot. The instructor was great seemed personable, interesting and very into the subject matter. I learned I haven't been pronouncing anything correctly after all these years",5
106350,Excellent course although can be confusing and difficult to keep track of where you are in the evolutionary chain. Especially good followup to Dino 101. I will definitely take other courses. Excellent lecturers and lectures!,5
106351,"We've got some extreme quality content here, as always when Philip J Curry is involved. The new student that presents most of the videos has great educational skills.",5
106352,"Completely awesome course for anyone to start, very straight forward and instructing. Would recommend 10/10",5
106353,"Awesome course! Loved the Dino 101 class and I was excited to see this in depth look at theropods. Tons of great information; excellent enthusiastic instructor; and useful notes. I hope to see more in the future, keep up the great work!",5
106354,"Great content, new cladistic information aviable, super staff!",5
106355,Excellent. The subject is clearly and concisely produced and delivered; the readings are spot on. Worth every minute.,5
106356,Superb; opened my mind to a whole new world,5
106357,"Excellent! I love birds, always. Now I know them more.",5
106358,great as usual,5
106359,I really love this course and it is,5
106360,"Overall good course, although at times narrow understanding of right answers.",4
106361,"Perfect course. I learned lot of stuff and really enjoyed it. I am only giving 4 stars because as a non-paying student I could not benefit from the graded assignments. As person who would never use the knowledge professionally (working in IT), I did not want to pay for the certificate.",4
106362,I'd like to be able to take a free version of the quizzes.,4
106363,Great course!,5
106364,"I've been a bird watcher for a few decades, and this course was right up my alley. I don't remember all the names---actually few of them---of all the precursors to birds, but it was a fascinating trip through very ancient history.",5
106365,Excellent addition to Dino101 and marine reptiles (which I am presently completing). Keep them com,5
106366,Great course.,5
106367,"The course has incredible content, but you are required to read quite a bit of information via lengthy pdfs prior to the videos. This is not my learning style so I found it challenging.As a Naturalist and bird lover, I was eager to take the course and glad that I did.",3
106368,Tough to pass. Great scientific info. Instructor born to teach.,4
106369,"These courses on Ancient Life Evolution are best when they discuss how species developed, how they adapted and how they were discovered. The laundry listing of species in some of the lectures was a snooze fest however. It also repeated what was in other lectures for the week. I would have preferred more information on the ecosystem in which the critters dwelled. The Ancient Marine Reptile class did a much better job of presenting this info although it did some laundry listing.",3
106370,"Interesting subject, but not much content and assessments are way too short. More variety in assignments would be nice too.",2
106371,Fantastic and extremely informative.,5
106372,"Really interesting, nicely presented.",4
106373,Very interesting and insightful course. Highly recommended,5
106374,Great course! Great work! Thank you so much!,5
106375,"Excellent course for anyone with an interest in the relationships among dinosaurs, and theropods in particular of course. The lectures themselves were well done and the lecture notes had more detail for those who would want to dig in a bit more for themselves. Keep up the great work!",5
106376,The instructor was superb in his knowledge of the subject matter and in his ability to explain complex concepts so as to be understood and remembered. Fascinating course...I did not want it to end!!!! Thank you,5
106377,reat course really enjoyed it and learned a lot :D 10/10,5
106378,"This is truly a very interesting and informative course on the origin of birds! My only preference would be that the rich lecture notes would be more thoroughly covered in the video lectures... even though that would make those videos longer (oh, what a ""shame"" that would be -- yeah, right!!). I was impressed that the video lectures reflected some of the latest findings in fossil & genetic findings. Last but by no means least, the professional yet personal style of the video lectures was not only helpful in my learning but made it that much more enjoyable! Well done!!!",5
106379,Very fun and exciting! It teaches you how the Theropods can be traced into the first birds in a really cool interactive way.,5
106380,"Very interesting course, kept me involved and was very interactive.",4
106381,The course is brilliant.,5
106382,"great course for anyone interested in dinos/evolution/birds, the extensive course notes were helpful",5
106383,Very nicely put together course. I learned a lot about birds evolved. I truly recommend this course to anyone wishing to learn about evolution of birds.,5
106384,"One of the first big books I remember reading was about dinosaurs and their world: much of the information changed with further discoveries, but the book gave me such a sense of wonder at the big ""lizards"" that roamed the earth!I found this course fascinating, especially since it follows on Dino 101. This helped me to see the various evolutionary tracks that were possible, and how the wide avian diversity came about. Looking at the anatomy development was very helpful to this bird-watcher/dino-watcher.Thank you so much for opening this program -- it has been a joy and I am looking forward to the other course openings as they come up.",5
106385,Incredible.,5
106386,wonderful and interesting class. thanks guys.,5

106391,"Wonderful course, full descriptive and interactive. Looking forward to the next course from Dr. Currie groups",5
106392,Wonderful course. Good material set at a good pace.,5
106393,Another excellent course. Thank you very much for your amazing work. One of the most engaging learning experiences on this site.,5
106394,"A very comprehensive overview of lung and esophageal cancer, from risk factors, to diagnosis, staging, surgery, palliative care, psychological support and pain management. I thoroughly enjoyed participating in this excellently presented course.",5
106395,"As a pediatric oncologist, I have not had to deal with either lung or esophageal cancers.The use of endoscopic analysis for determining lymph node involvement was quite an eye-opener.Likewise, the immunologic histochemical variation was a valuable learning experience as were thepathologic descriptions of adenoca variants.The only possible criticism might be the thoracic surgeons use of acronyms without explanation, butthis was minor.Kudos to the teamGratefully Gerald Vladimer MD",5
106396,"Very important, helpful and very very well done. Thanks a lot",5
106397,Excelent and uptodate information,5

106425,"Great course, great teachers! There's a lot of useful information and inspiring examples.",5
106426,"This is a great course! Lots to think about. It turns out Transmedia Storytelling is a lot harder than you might think. It's not just branding across different channels. The course is clear, builds on itself from week to week, challenges you to think and write and then apply your new understanding as you grade your peers. You will have to come up with one storyworld idea you can run with for the four assignments. <brag>I got 97%!</brag>",5
106427,Very helpful course! I particularly enjoyed learning about the great variety of transmedia projects from the makers themselevs.,5
106428,The additional links and research material were really interesting and insightful.,4
106429,probably the most interesting course I've ever done on Coursera.,5
106430,Amazing course.,5
106431,"This was a great course. Well structured into the four areas you need to understand to build transmedia experiences. Loved the mix of industry stories with lectures.My biggest bug bear is that ALL of the content is delivered via video. The transcripts are there, but they don't read well on their own. I would really love an eBook to go with this course for future reference.",4
106432,"Very interesting!At first, I just wanted to learn about Transmedia technics and when I was told to tell a story, well ...And now, I'm ready to make it known!",5
106433,Very interesting course and well organized and presented. It is a great opportunity to apply your creativity! ;-),5
106434,The best online course I've learned by far. Right from the course structure to the content everything was just awesome. The team has relentlessly worked in getting the global gurus to talk about the content and created the best content online for trans media storytelling. I've already recommended my colleagues to take this course.,5
106435,"Es un excelente curso para quienes quieren proyectar su talento artístico en proyectos de cualquier tipo. Los profesores son claros y concisos, y el material de estudio es abundante para entender el propósito de contar historias a través de diversas plataformas de forma sustentable en el tiempo.This is an excellent course for those who want to project their artistic talents in any kind of project. Teachers are clair and concise, and the material to study is numerous. It is a great course to understand the purpose of telling stories across diverse platforms and in a sustainable form in time.",5
106436,"Generally, a good course.The lectures and supporting talks were instructive, helpful, and inspiring. The instructors and industry experts were well chosen.The assignments were pretty good. They provided nice constraints and freedom of expression to come up with ideas and think about how one might create and adapt a story world so that meaningful experiences can be had from it. The peer review process was good, but I would have liked instructor feedback as well (I suppose it is free for because of only being peer reviewed though).",4
106437,I Really enjoyed the course. It was very helpful. I have lots of books and papers to read deeply and investigate how to improve my future projects. Well done!! :),5
106438,"This course is very good. After reading a few very good books con Transmedia, and taking a few courses on Transmedia related topics, I can tell this is THE course that has really made me think I can do it. It provides information, examples and advices to meet the requirements to build a transmedia world with meaningful and engaging experiences. After this course I feel I know how to move on with the idea of Transmedia I had in mind when I started the course. Thank you to all the excellent teachers and congratulations for this wonderful course!",5
106439,"A great course that will let you in on a world of possibilities when it comes to storytelling. Videos and readings are focused and to the point, with many points of view from both specialists and interdisciplinary experts as to give you a wide variety of opinions, approaches, and food for thought. Even if you're not interested in marketing your stories and making money, this course is still a top resource to refresh your Storytelling 101, as well as enrich your toolkit for the purposes of giving your story the best chance by enhancing it the right way.",5
106440,"This course offers a comprehensive introduction to transmedia studies and practices. The framework of the course is well structured and it's easy to follow. The resources are fantastic with lots of advice and content provided by industry professionals. If you've heard of transmedia, but don't know what it is or how it's going to change storytelling in the future, take this course and find out.",4
106441,"it is a very good course, but if I do not up grade the course (paid the fee) , I cannot go to next course! I feel really sorry about that!",5
106442,"It is very very bad that only students assess the assignments. Lots of students can't count sentences, can't see and generally are very negligent in evaluating the work of others. No teachers involve the process. No appelation possibility, no forum for discussions!",1
106443,Very useful course! Tks!,5
106444,What a wonderful and useful course!,5
106445,!Great Course¡,5
106446,good course I've ever learnt through video and exercises,4

106458,"This course was very helpful. I was not aware of several mistakes that I usually make before taking this course. I feel more confident after learning new tips and being able to identify the areas that I must improve. Taking in consideration that grammar covers a lot of topics, the professors were able to summarize the most important topics and to make the classes interactive.",4
106459,This is absolute treasure! I want to thank you so much,5
106460,"This is an amazing course for anyone who is not a not a native speaker, and it might be useful for native speakers alike!",5

106485,Thank you a lot i find this course very useful and interesting,5
106486,Great Course,5
106487,"This is an instructive course but not represented in a very engaging way. I wish that the representers find a more interesting and engaging way to teach grammar. I will be doing the whole specialization but there moments that I get so bored and unmotivated, I have to force myself to keep going. And I love English and find grammar interesting in general.",3
106488,"Very useful course to users of English from pre-intermediate level and up. The information is presented in interesting and understandable way. Practice exersises are great, you never get bored. The teachers pay attention to really confusing grammar points. For sure will enroll to the other courses from the university.",5
106489,Excellent class even for native English speakers!,5
106490,Pretty good I think,3
106491,Thank you very much! The best course!,5
106492,This course is very useful. There are so many notes that we don't pay more attention to. I recommend studying every single word carefully.,4
106493,This course is very helpful in my lenguage learning,5
106494,The course is really great and approaches the most common English mistakes. However I believe the approach could be more adult.,4
106495,very helpful!,5
106496,It's really helpful!,5
106497,Very informative. I enjoyed it very much. I wish they grade all exams in this course,5
106498,"I enjoyed this course. I only wished I had received some feedback from instructors, or someone qualified to give more substantive feedback on the final assignment. I appreciate the peer review, both doing it and receiving it; however, having some feedback from a qualified evaluator is always a formative experience.",5
106499,"As a graphic and motion designer it gave insights on many concepts, terminolgies, and consideration I haven't known before.",4
106500,"Great course, learned a whole lot of interesting stuff about Design.",5
106501,A great course to get an overview of UI design!,5

106503,The course is too long.,3
106504,I thoroughly enjoyed this course and learned a tremendous amount!,5
106505,Good basic course,4
106506,"Very good course to begin with and generally get into the frame of mind to apply a bottom up approach when thinking of a solution to a problem. Don't expect to start designing things right after this course, but you will start thinking and approaching problems from different angles.",5
106507,"Thanks for all, is a great course, thanks Coursera and thanks for each opportunity.",4
106508,I really liked the way this course was organized. It offered a good mix of multiple choice quizzes as well as actual hands-on activities with peer evaluation and feedback. The videos provided a ton of real-life examples that helped quickly lodge the material into long-term memory which was very helpful. I am looking forward to the next course in this series.,5
106509,"This course was a good introduction to the overall concepts. I am already working in the field so it was elementary to me, but I feel it has laid a good foundation for the specialization. I do not, however, feel it would hold much value as a stand alone course.I am not sure how you would achieve it given the asynchronous nature of the medium, but I would love more opportunities for feedback and discussion.",3
106510,Informative and task-oriented!You will definitely improve your UI skills level!,5
106511,Lot of useful knowledge!,5
106512,Thank you all for your team effort. Looking forward to continue.,5
106513,"This was a very informative and valuable class-- definitely university quality, as if I was actually at the school. The course has really changed the way I look at design as the lectures are very in-depth. The professors are great at demonstrating examples too.",5
106514,Very helpful for beginners to understand good design vs. bad design. Also helpful for gaining basic knowledge on how to think about design implementation.,5
106515,"English is not my first language but I have already taken other courses at Coursera, which I found very good, and that I was able to follow using the English subtitles.In this course, there is a teacher who speaks very fast and it is difficult to follow their lessons.In addition, some peer-graded assignement videos are without English subtitles.",3
106516,"Amazing course! A must for UI/UX beginners and Product Managers.As a PM, this course will help me lead discussions with the UI and UX folks.If you have only programming background, this will be extremely helpful course.",5
106517,"Before attending this course, the world of UI Design looked complicated and daunting. It was really a pleasure attending it through Coursera. The videos are comprehensive, easy to understand and the assignments help a lot towards feeling more confident and eager to explore what's next towards UI Design specialization.",5
106518,Awesome introduction course!,5
106519,Good Introduction to User Interface Design.!,5
106520,I learned a lot.,5
106521,"Easy to understand, well organized and the lecturers are very nice! This is a very good class for beginners, and those who are interested in UI design.",5
106522,Content is really good and I learned concepts really well because its well structure. Videos can become better. I recommend this course to every UI enthusiast.,4
106523,"The content of this Intro class is excellent. I do think the assignments could afford to be a little more challenging and I do wish that a TA could review the assignments submitted. Other than that, the instructors are very knowledgeable and passionate about the material and make learning about it fun and interesting. I look forward to the other classes in this specialization.",5
106524,"Some interesting points of view and case studies. But the material itself is not in a structured format that means you could lose your way half way through the video. Too one dimensional in terms of presentation and no opportunity to interact with tutors. To summarize, I think it is a waste of opportunity to not use the video/interactivity/collaboration platform to its fullest potential.",2
106525,Great course!! very good!,5
106526,Well structured with good teachers and full of pratical examples that help you understand the design principles used in UI design.,5
106527,The course content is adequate enough to justify the course title.The best part is the assignments and the peer reviews. Reviewing the peers' work is gave me more insights into the subject. And getting reviewed by peers made me correct my self.Bad parts: Few of the videos are presented in a manner that the presenter was reading notes by looking at a screen and without any expressions. This was defeating the purpose of video tutorial. The basic expectation of a video tutorial over a text reading is that the presenter could put some expression and interactivity.,4
106528,The content is organised and simple to comprehend.,5
106529,Mostly just common sense. And the peer review assignments are mind-numbing.,2
106530,Great course!!!I learned a lot,5
106531,"Generally fascinating, but with some issues with transcription of lectures and clarity of questions.",4
106532,I have respected the professor of this course very much. And the cour,5
106533,It's a very good beginners class. The lectures are quite thorough and well-suited to those who are auditing the class.,4
106534,Great all-round with both factual and theory basis. Plenty of recommended literature and complementary sources. I really recommend this course for those that wish a deeper understanding of the Republican history of South Korea.,5
106535,An excellent course for anyone who wants a good overview of the Republic of Korea and it's political history.,5
106536,I think it is best for the lecturer to speak Korean and have subtitles.,4
106537,"The teacher is amazing, and the content is interesting and makes me want to pursue Law. However the classmates are extremely aggregating and track you down to give you low scores in order that they themselves may succeed. I cannot explore my interests with this sort of setting.",2
106538,One of the best law courses in Coursera!,5
106539,"Great course! The professor is unstructured, and has the tendency to ramble in the lecture, but thoroughly enjoyed the course.",4
106540,It's always interesting to read between the lines and go beyond a text and especially the Constitution! A big thank you to Professor Amar and Coursera for making this available to us!,5
106541,"The information was interesting but sort of long. In fact, I started this so long ago that I don't remember most of what was said, only that it was long. I did enjoy the first course, America's Written Constitution but someone was paying attention then and it was on the older format so it was better. I rate the course so poorly, however, because of the total lack of staff involvement and the worthless peer review papers. I have a huge problem with the peer review process. It is of no value and should be banned. Be that as it may, however, it takes weeks to get reviews and there is NO ONE FROM THE COURSE STAFF PAYING ANY ATTENTION TO THE COURSE!! There is not one posting from course staff in the forums. There has been no response to any of the so called, ""comment on this assignment"" messages I've been leaving since JULY. There has been no response to an e-mail, supposedly sent to the instructor on my behalf by the Coursera help desk weeks ago. It is obvious that the instructor has abandoned this course. If no one is going to pay attention to it, it should be taken down. If you just want the information, watch the videos but don't expect anything else, including any response whatsoever from this course. I've wasted too much time on this. I'm done.",1
106542,Great course and highly informative. Learned a lot. Beautifully presented.,5
106543,Great course!!,5
106544,"The videos and lectures were fine, but there seemed to be a lot missing from this course. The discussion boards were empty and the reliance on peer reviewed papers left a little to be desired. There could have been more instruction given on how to grade.",2
106545,Engaging: this professor's passion for his subject is infectious.,5
106546,"Hard to grasp the complexity of what we call our Constitution, and the professor goes a long way to stretch a student's thinking that far. So kindly done, too.",5
106547,Excellent course in understanding the American legal system,4
106548,"This is a great and really interesting course. I am a non-US lawyer trained in the Common Law English legal tradition and thus, it is quite refreshing for me to 'get my feet wet' in a slightly different but not totally dissimilar legal system.",5
106549,"Excellent course! I enjoyed the lectures and writing assignments and it was a good introduction to Constitutional Law. I also took Part 1 of this course. Thanks to Yale, Coursera, and Professor Amar for making this available online.",5
106550,interesting and fascinating how much I didn't know.,5
106551,Excellent Course with extremely detailed lectures.,5
106552,Explains a lot about decisions that do not seem to go with the written constitution.,5
106553,Professor Amar is very well organized and explains the contents in a very clear - and deep - way!,5
106554,"The lecturer's style doesn't go with the nature of a MOOC. By using his book as the notes for lectures, he doesn't give himself a chance to prioritize content so it's kept clear in the exposition. His favorite word is uh-um. In a classroom (face-to-face) situation, the lecturer is likely to see and react to listeners' look of confusion; in a studio he is just talking to himself. He repeats points -- this can be good if done smoothly but it's very confusing when the lecturer is inarticulate, like the present case. It's really too bad because he clearly has a lot of knowledge that could be used to popularize thinking about the unwritten constitution.",3
106555,Great!,5
106556,An amazing course that expresses the real subjects meanings of the Constitution with strong juridical arguments.,5
106557,Great course,5
106558,"I thought the course was very interesting and the videos were great. One criticism I have, though, is that the name of the course is misleading; it really should have been called Educational Reform in the US. I don't think we studied specifically urban issues at all.",4
106559,"Logically organised, informative and enjoyable. This was an excellent introductory course to Urban Education Issues and provided me with a solid starting point for exploring the subject.",5
106560,The topics were very thorough and covered everything I was wanting to learn more about in this area. The videos were done well. I also really liked the opportunity to comment and interact with other learners throughout the course.,5
106561,Awesome course. A little difficult but worth it.,5
106562,I am thankful for the opportunity to learn. I promise to use this information to help empower and develop urban schools across Ohio and hopefully this nation. I believe all kids can learn but not all practices are productive to bring about hope to all young people. I found the professor to be brilliant and insightful. Thank you again for the opportunity to learn,5
106563,Great work,5
106564,The course is great. I will highly recommended to everyone who desire to build a fundamental knowledge and skills regarding strategic analysis for business organizations.,5
106565,"A great introduction to business strategy tools (which gets exponentially more complex when you apply them in the follow-on course!). I really appreciated the deep but approachable theoretical discussions of economic rents, and the professor's serious efforts to bring together business and economic principles. As a former student of economics, it gave me a great anchor point in the course.While I really appreciate the case-based method, the volume of students just isn't high enough to allow for much vigorous discussion on the forums (or wasn't for me). I would highly recommend taking the course with a friend or colleague and setting aside time to connect each week to get the most out of the case discussions.",4
106566,"Enjoyed this learning and the peer review of case studies. Since the course is online, performing peer reviews displays how other learners view the material. Very insightful.",5
106567,I do have learned basic and powerfull tools to start analyzing the strategic positionning for a company.Course is well structured with a step by step methodology and concrete examples,5

106570,"Is this a fabulous course, complete, that covers many areas of business strategy. I recommend",5
106571,As an entry level strategic consultant I've found this course to be a very useful introduction to the core principles of business strategy. The pace of the course is challenging but manageable. The content was well explained and there were some great take-aways in terms of slide decks and sources of information. Thanks,5
106572,Thank you very much. I will finish left courses here.,5
106573,"In this short course, you can learn few important key topics of business strategy. During the session there are several real cases discussed for understanding better the lesson, but several doubts remains theory. The end-of-session case studies are too complex for using the theories learned. Too many questions were not solved... but it is ""Foundation of...""",4
106574,"Its really hard to communicate with Coursera. I have paid for the course, havent enrolled due to my illness and there is nobody who can help me out with this.Its a very nice project ""Coursera"" but still has too much to make up... what a pity.Martin",1
106575,"I gained much from this course. However, the final assignment is quite difficult to complete for students with no access to data on companies and industries. Had that been readily available (without an exorbitant fee to data providers), I would have rated the course with 4 stars.",3
106576,very satisfied !!,5
106577,"The peer review has some issues, but overall the course is great.",4
106578,Its a great start for strategy enthusiasts!,5
106579,"Overall, the contents are too fluffy and not very tangible. I appreciate though putting the tools into action and having to work on the competitive position assignment, it provides great insights on what matters in a competitive market. As an optimization proposal I suggest to cover the resources of week one, like terms and formulas. That is much more crucial than some of the fluffy contents. Also the companies discussed during the course should not be more known global companies (like Redhook, or the food market examples), hence not to restrict it to USA.",3
106580,It is challenging in part to take this course but its worth it. thank you,4
106581,Much better than i thining,5

106601,"I´ve never taken on-line classes, but being this the first time I must say that it is a great method to learn with some flexibility.

106632,"Informative, Thought",5
106633,Really interesting way to know about this area,5

The course material was well-explained in the videos, and the assignments and final case study did a stand-up job of covering all of the material.Granted, I already have an undergraduate degree in business, but I found this course to be a fantastic refresher for the 3 strategy courses that had begun to fade from memory in the 3 years since I finished university.A big 'thank you!' to the Darden School of Business - I've no doubt that I'll be looking for other courses of interest offered from your team, once returning to the office in the new-year.Kevin",5
106649,Excellent course. Would recommend it to anyone.,5
106650,"Hello! I Just started the course, and spell-bounded by the professor's presentations. There can be no better way of spelling out the tough word 'Strategy' in simplest English. Thanks to the providers and best of luck to the participants.",5
106651,Great course,5
106652,"This review is for Coursera. Why you want me to click 2 times to submit a review? On home screen when i click on stars to review, new window opens.. This is not a great UX.. Please reduce no of clicks that a user has to make to submit the reviews.",1

106662,"Very good teachers, always trying to explain the theory with real examples.Very good course, that stimulates you to do the final assignment, the moment when you really learn.",5
106663,"Great course, but they should provide a statement of accomplishment...",4
106664,"Think it was a very good course, a bit high level though. It is ""Foundations"" though, so that is a somewhat unfair criticism.",4
106665,"Outstanding course, great introduction to strategy. Teaches you some basic frameworks. I registered for the class in August but didnt finish. When I registered again in September, they completely revamped it. I was blown away by the progress. Im definitely satisfied with my experience",5
106666,"Final project was very useful for consolidating the principles of the course, which seemed like a solid intro to the topic.",5
106667,Excellent course! Theoretical models are well-explained with multiple examples from real life.,5
106668,May be there is a technical glitch in answering the Questions of daily assignments while selecting options of the question type 'select all that apply '.,4
106669,Very clear ideia about strategy and it so well design (and taught) that you think you are dealing and learning a basic and simple thing but as soon as you start doing the exercises you see how challenging are the questions and reasoning behind it.,5
106670,I really like the course material. It is well structured and well paced.,5
106671,"I really like this course so far. The lessons are organized, practical and clear. So far, I'm getting a great deal of valuable information from them, and can clearly see how to use certain techniques to make my business more competitive.",5
106672,Great Complete course from great University,5
106673,Extremely insightful course by Prof. Gautam Kaul who also happens to deliver content perfectly.,5
106674,very good course.,4
106675,"way too slow and too long ; too many digressions, by-side remarks, lessons of life, etc ... go straight to the point.",1
106676,Absolutely worth my time!,5
106677,Not an easy course but it is worth every effort to complete it. The video lessons and the many practice exercises demand time and effort but you will gain a better understanding and good perception on valuation.,5
106678,A Good course,5
106679,"The pedagogy is good but the assignment seem tough,what we have been teach in the video session.Appreciate for the initiative to conduct holistic courses of finance.",5
106680,"I love finance, and I love how the instructor teaches it. very thorough!",5
106681,"The course is very cheap. However, training material has poor quality.",1
106682,"Very informative and rewarding. Professor is very energetic and shows he is totally involved in the course. The major problem with this course is that, as complex as it is, coupled with the lack of access to the instructors to ask questions, perhaps the assistants could be more responsive and helpful with problems students are having problems with. It makes no sense to learn without knowing where one is making mistakes and how to correct them.",3
106683,Good course but would have loved two things : more practical examples and certainly more detailed info on multiples.,4
106684,Very good as a structure. Valuable as a course.,5
106685,Very engaging instructor plying cogent videos and challenging quizes,4
106686,Challenging. The big puzzle combined out of 4 courses. Worth trying to develop valuation skills and apply them to the real world.,5
106687,"The course requires lot of effort and thoroughly enjoyed. To be honest the case preperation was challenging but worth taking as that improves first your writing skills and then applying your thoughts to come to a valuation. As the professor says you can value anything once you understand the beauty of finance , i surely beleive that is the case. Wishing all the best.",5
106688,"I liked that this Capstone Project made me think about creative ways to address financial situations that we have studied along the Specialization, but applied to a real-life case. Also, analyzing other people's creative ideas is very eye-opening because of their different perspectives to address those same situations.",5
106689,"A great Capstone, thanks very much to all those participate in this helpful course, University of Michigan, Coursera, Prof. Prof. Gautam Kaul, and all stuff.",5
106690,Thanx a lot,4
106691,"Introduction course to other courses, not much to learn here. And also some quizzes question were never addressed on the content.",3
106692,"Purely theoretical, I doesnt go deep enough, there arent any assignments, only a quiz at the end of the week. Poor material per week.",1
106693,"I have just started, passed few weeks, but I enjoy this course! As I am also learning Spanish, I have a unique possibility to merge learning language with my professional interest :) Thank you very much for this course and specialization in advance! :)",5
106694,very little interaction in the final project. seems this module does not follow the principles of the earlier 4 with regards to virtual teaching,2
106695,One of the BEST! I loved the whole Virtual Teacher Series!,5
106696,Hard topics but easy explained or illustrated.,5
106697,Great Job!,4
106698,"The course is excellently done with well-ordered sequence of lectures that explains visual perception in a new and very interesting way. The instructor speaks in an easily understood English, and his presentation of the material is very well done. I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in psychology, vision, neuroanatomy and neurophysiology.",5
106699,"The course introduces new information gradually, within a known context, as well as exploring the use of images (of the brain, for example). These procedures facilitate learning. I was not able to keep up with the course at the pace of the class (on the dates stipulated) because I am learning English in parallel. But that is a deficiency of mine and I did not give course. Congratulations to the Coursera, Duke University, the organizers of the Visual Perception and the Brain course, and especially to Professor PhD Dale Purves, for excellent content quality, approach, theme, and the opportunity to democratize knowledge to anyone in the world. Thank you!!",5
106700,It is a must for all those who would love to explore vision at the perspective of neuroscience and evolution.,4
106701,Very interesting and nicely challenging! Thank you very much!,5
106702,An awesome course to get familiar with the mechanism of visual perception.,5
106703,"great layout and well presented. concepts were stimulating and I felt I learnt a lot. I would have liked some discussion around topics such as amblyopia and development, effects of observer movement, and the links between visual perception and the vestibular system. Having said that, I think the content was plenty for a 5 week course.",4
106704,"Course was amazing. It deals with how to correctly understand visual illusions through empirical data collection. It does not delve into the anatomical aspects, or the cellular aspects, of vision. Some drawbacks would be the lack of explanation on how to model or collect the data, which is probably too complicated to state in a online course anyway.",4
106705,"Carefully listen to ""About the Course"" video, so your expectations won't be deceived",5
106706,Really great course!,5
106707,this course is very interesting,5
106708,great course: do it again!,5
106709,"Amazing course by Dr. Dale Purvez! This is my second course from Duke University and i absolutely loved it all! This course was very unique in itself ! i.e It involved much more than just assignments. The final test which involved writing an essay which had to be peer reviewed was a good experience. Also reviewing the work done by fellow students have to be noted for it would be an amazing experience for anyone taking this course! I am very much looking for ward for such courses in future. Thank You Dr.Purves, Coursera and Duke University for this course!",5
106710,Very helpful in understanding the difference between visual perception and real physical world. This also shed light onto how the brain works during our decision-making process.,5
106711,"Very well researched and articulate professor, incredibly knowledgeable.",4
106712,"It is a genial..debo course congratulate Dr. Dale Purves, I'm from Ecuador and have followed their texts and articles for 7 years, I have trained as a doctor and I have been fascinated by the nervous system through its bastos knowledge and way of express theories from a simple way to complex ..Thank you for making these courses ..",5
106713,"I don't like that the 3 and 4 star reviews are missing!Coursera seems to sometimes remove reviews with lower numbers of starts.I thought that this course was going to be mostly on the brain, but it wasn't at all.... just a small section.If your main interest is in vision then it might be different, but for me being interested only in how vision relates to the brain, there was very little useful information in this course for me.",3
106714,"is a excellent course, I´m a neurosurgeon and I think Dr. Dale Purves, as my teacher. this is amazing topic, and full the basic them of neuroscience, is an accuracy understand of world. the most enigmatic facts explained by amazing master of battlefield of neuroscience.",5
106715,"whished there would have been MORE material. nice Course, even tough the Speaker speaks a bit slow and some explanations would have been much quicker to understand by Videos instead of verbal/textual explanations..",5
106716,"Really intresting course, simple but educational lectures! Very helpful.",5
106717,"Very interesting course! I also liked to listen to the lecturer, his voice and manner of speaking makes learning easy and pleasant. Thank you so much!",5
106718,"Amazing Course Structure. I completely lost track of the fact that I am, originally a Mathematics Student!",5
106719,Amazing course!,5
106720,i have learned a lot from this course!,5
106721,"It was a good course but kind of vague. Lectures were too long and full of talking instead of pause questions to keep the learner involved rather than just listening. I hoped if there were assignments and games to keep us more engaged and to assure that we fully understand the content. Otherwise, Professor Maurice Schweitzer did a great job with providing engaging examples in each video and I got to know a lot of new stories worldwide.",3
106722,The professors present interesting information about the topic and the supplemental material is helpful in diving deeper into the topic. I also really enjoy how engaging the course is with the quizzes and short answers.,5
106723,Great Course design,5
106724,"This is quite a good course, light on people who are not in HR or Psychology background. It subtly let's you understand a few key factors every manger or supervisor can deploy in their respective work place.",4

106732,awesome !!!!!very logical and to the point with all real life examples,5
106733,A perfect course to understand a typical workspace psychology and an engaging approach to deliver knowledge. I had a lot of fun learning this course.,5
106734,"Some of the pdf reports generators, videos and links don't work, besides that good course.",4
106735,Great course! Highly recommend to anyone in a management position or anyone hoping to be in one. As a Project Manager I found it very useful even when ideas i was familiar with were being discussed as this course helped me find a new way to articulate and discuss them,5
106736,"Pretty basic knowledge. in my humble opinion, the questionnaires are obviously used for the research of the tutors, without offering so much learning benefit to the students. But good stuff to know.",3
106737,Amazing course,5
106738,"Great course, I learned the basic of psychology at work and give a good insight of what to correctly do to motivate, have less issues with stress and so on. :)",4

106744,"Very useful and interesting, mixing theoritical insights and practical exercices.",5
106745,This course has become so influential in my way of viewing people as a true asset to the world and how to solve it's problems that I am researching further how to best filter out the concept of mastery as a motivator for people in all tasks and writing my dissertation in this area. I am truly excited to find out more about how we operate and how isolating personal wellbeing as a fundamental element of our success might bring about positive change in the world.,5
106746,"I am a not working guy, so many questions are hard for me to answer. However, the terms described in the course make sense to me and I really leant something form this course.",4

106760,This is such a well executed course. Enjoyed the videos and way it has been presented!,5
106761,Very important for every working person to understand and apply.,5
106762,Amazing. Your idea with surveys and tests with the results! Just wow! That's a very smart way to collect data besides all. And the lectures are useful and interesting. Now I even consider University of Western Australia as a place for PhD.,5
106763,What wonderful course!,5
106764,Excellent short course introducing the psychological aspects / theories at work and work designing. Lectures are short and to the point. Further useful material are linked as additional reading. This course helped me to gain better knowledge on the work related theories and also to rethink on some of current and past work experience. Thank you all for your efforts in publishing this course.,5
106765,"Very interesting course, I really appreciate seeing the real world application of psychological theories and the material was presented in a variety of ways to gain and hold the learner's attention. The extra reading and additional video resources further enhanced my understanding of the subject matter. The material was delivered simply and effectively. Thank you! Good Job!",5
106766,"Really good course. I took this course to gain some knowledge, to know what psychology is about.",5
106767,"The course is interesting and the self-reflection activies are great opportunies to learn about yourself. However, the course is very short. Each week takes less than 1 hour to watch and it feels like an introduction of an introduction. If you love to learn a lot about something, I don't think this course is for you. However, if you want to take time to learn about yourself, it's great.",3
106768,Great teaching system. This particular course is well thought out and it is a unique way of handing out pedagogy through self assessment surveys.I LIKE.,5
106769,I love this course! It is very inspiring and full of great ideas!,5
106770,Fantastic practice for creative writing. Informative and fun. I recommend!,5
106771,Simple but complete. Great introduction to the bussiness,5
106772,I found the course to be a very good introduction and review for beginner writers and also experienced writers who just need a refresher of sorts. Comments from peers are the most helpful and motivational aspect of the course.,4
106773,"I loved it. The best course I've done in Coursera so far. It gave me the energy, tools and encouragement to write again. Would totally recommend it!",5
106774,"The course is great! However, there are no written examples of expectations for weeks 4 and 5 At least David Hill shows examples after lectures. Not everyone is an audible learner therefore written examples should be posted for week 5",4
106775,"While the information is certainly good, and I enjoyed listening to David Hill, it is too basic for me. I was looking for something that wasn't an introductory course, but I took it thinking the peer reviews would be worth it. I had a difficult time downloading peer writing to review, and I never got any feedback on my assignment. I also went to the forums for discussion, but there wasn't anyone adding new information. It seems like a ghost class without any real live students. Since it is not interactive in any way, I am just spinning my wheels. Not worth the effort.",3
106776,"I loved the experience ,This platform is great is a great place to study",5
106777,"""Writing for Young Readers: Opening the Treasure Chest"" was great! I actually completed a children's book text during the course, and created chapters and framework for another. Classmates also gave great feedback. You get out of it what you put into it.",5
106778,A very goo,5
106779,This was a great class! I learned a lot and had a wonderful time with the course.,5
106780,"Wonderful course!!! I got so much from the lectures, interviews, and exercise. I found the course very informative with valuable tips. I am new to the writing world and am excited to embark in the journey. This course helped pave the way in what to expect. Thank-you so much for the course!!!",5
106781,"This course is great so far - really helpful and specific - but I feel like there is an unnecessary amount of repetition of certain points. We were told ""use your own experiences to fuel your stories"" in 2 videos with David Hill, a reading assignment and then again in a video talking to another author. While I appreciate the ""look, they say it too!"" idea of backing up their ideas, I feel like this is overkill.",4
106782,"The course gave me some insight into the processes involved in editing and seeking publication. However, I feel it was too skewed toward writing for VERY young readers, whereas it was marketed as including Young Adult fiction.",4
106783,"The course was good, was helpful and the peers were respectful.",5
106784,Great course to learn the basics of writing and to get a broader view on what i means to be an author of children's fiction.,4
106785,I enjoyed a lot! Congratulations!,5
106786,A really enjoyable course that was helpful and enlightening. It got my creative juices flowing and gave me some tips and tools to help me along the way. Recommended to anyone interested in writing anything.,5
106787,"While I found the content and instructors to be very good, I don't feel I received any true constructive criticism that will help me with my writing. I would have preferred having an instructor review my work and provide proper feedback. I understand it costs to have someon",3

106790,it's a great course ;),5
106791,"Very good course which I'd highly recommend to writer beginners and those, like myself, who need to brush up and learn a few more techniques. All the lessons were very useful and the assignments were challenging and interesting",5
106792,"Very generic advice although the interviews with children's writers were illuminating and helpful. The marking system was inaccurate, for example it deducted marks for submitting an assignment over word count when it wasn't! Good, solid advice about setting character, scene and place and ideas to help you out of writer's block. The two main presenters were very knowledgeable and it was pitched to an international audience. Some of the activities were repetitious but I guess the craft of writing is but there was a sense of the course tapering away at the end with a proposal letter to a publisher with very little exemplar material being provided to assist.",2
106793,This course was very helpful and contained valuable information for a beginning writ,5
106794,I've learned so much from this course. Not just about the whole writing process but also some valuable information on how to get your work published. Thanks for opening this treasure chest for new writers like me! Cheers!,4
106795,Perfect,5
106796,"I love this course, It is really helping me improve my writing skills, and grow my love of writing. :)",5
106797,"This is one of the best courses on writing for young readers that I have come across. Of course, I have not taken many courses on writing. However, for a amateur writer like me, this course has provided enough fodder for thought and action. It has shown the path to be taken by a new writer, both in terms of developing the writing skills and providing information on editing and publishing. I would recommend this course to all those who aspire to be an author",5
106798,Great class to take if you're a beginner or more of an advanced writer to refresh your learning on the subject. Love how I also got to learn about the editing and publishing process as well. Definitely would not have minded if the class were a few weeks longer. Very glad I signed up and took this course. I am more motivated to continue my life as a writer.,5
106799,Wonderful course. Strongly recommended for all new authors.,5
106800,"Loved this course! I just wished there was a better system for peer reviews, because I couldn't get any helpful tips or feedbackthrough them.",4

106813,I love this at the most,5
106814,I found this course a very inspiring a thoughtful experience. It gives you direction provides you a meaningful path to follow.,4
106815,Learning never should be assumed by the source. Online sources too can outshine other platforms. This course is doing wonders to me and is definitely making me a better writer.,5
106816,I had a great time learning . It was fun as well as informative. Maybe we can have a story competition in another of your courses.,4
106817,Amazing course I love it. I learned a lot about how to write for young readers.thank you,5
106818,A very introductory course that helps in getting an idea on how to write for young readers. I found it quite useful.,4
106819,"Kind of basic about the writing stuff, i wish it work more about audience and characteristics of each age. Very useful the second part of the course, about editing.",3
106820,David Hill is simply superb with clarity and focus on small small things that matter for young writers and readers alike. Blessed to have attended this course.,5
106821,what I loved better was the possibility of rescheduling the deadlines :-) I work in the peruvian rainforest and sometimes there is no access to internet for a good while,5
106822,"just right tone, speed, ecouragement",5
106823,loving this course so far,5
106824,"This course is fantastic, it show me lots of things that end up help me with my work!",5
106825,"Great course for beginners, simple and encouraging. I highly recommend it!",5
106826,"This course has some very distinct and informative material which was terrific for learning about writing for young readers. I particularly found Maria Gill's modules very informative, encouraging and well presented.What I found REALLY disheartening, was that we as students (who aren't qualified and at times, have questionable English literacy skills), were the ones who were given the task of assessing all of the assessments in this course. I was really hoping for feedback from the industry experienced course creators :( . The other thing that was frustrating is that 'word count' was a criteria. Some students were brutal in their grading because one was over the word count by a few words, so be aware of that, if you are going to undertake this 'course'.This is not so much a course which leads to some sort of exam or qualification (dictionary.cambridge.org) but an independent information acquirement experience.I learnt quite a lot about writing and publishing and would encourage you to do this course, as it does contain some great information and tips, just be aware that grading is based on newbies like us and sometimes the feedback can be a bit disheartening but just persevere and you will learn lots. These people really know what they are talking about.",4
106827,"The course 'Writing for Young Readers: Opening the Treasure Chest' helped me advance in my writing and rethink my approach in way. It also put me in contact with other young authors and going along with them was both inspirational and rewarding.The course lectures are very carefully curated and the two narrators, David Hill and Maria Gill, have made efforts to keep the participatns fascinated in many ways. The interviews with established authors from around the world are very insightful.",5
106828,"Its a great Course.It has a lot of good recommendations, interviews and tools for new writers.It also has a very good format and the authors that participate communicate good and share very interesting experiences and points of view of what it is for them to write.I think the interaction and forums dont work very good. Ive taken other workshops (not online) but a primarial resource for improving and getting to find out things is the feedback from others.Thank you very much, and when I start publishing Ill get my certificate from this course.",5
106829,"One of my favorites parts of all the course, was the interview with the playwright. The course is about guiding the participants, or those who want to start to write, with the most important and necessary advices. In addition, the profesor wants to make us understand that writting is more than just a profession: it's passion, and the most effective way of see that point is by hearing a writter who feels that way about litterature active and also pasive.",4
106830,only just started this course but already enjoying it very much,5
106831,Very helpful and easy to follow,5
106832,I liked this course a lot. It really helped me and encouraged me to start writing.,5
106833,Pretty basi,3
106834,"Great course to actually get started writing, instead of just having the idea! I got some great tips and a bunch of first drafts that I'll come back to. Thank you so much!",5
106835,"This is such an amazing course! It really opened my eyes to the fact that writing isn't just putting your ideas in words, it's much more than that, and it's really enlightening and helpful! Thank you so much for all the work that you've put into this course!",5
106836,I really appreciate being able to do this course for free. It is by far the best course I have done in Coursera yet. The content is great and very well planned. So much to get your inspiration from and qualified to teachers to guide you along the way. What more can one ask for?,5

106841,Everything you need to start.,5
106842,"I'm not far into this course, but I believe it will be a great asset to any fledgling writers who want to write for children, or for more experienced writers who want to observe their craft under a new light. Very engaging and helpful.",5
106843,I have learned so much from this course. Anyone that wants to write for young readers would do well to take this course. Thank you.,5
106844,I LOVED these instructors! I wish I could take an entire year of classes with them. I felt like they really want the students to succeed. Great course for learning the basics of writing for young readers. They gave us plenty to think about and whetted my desire to write even more! Thanks so much!,5
106845,Very simplistic in places and preaches their style as if it is the only way sometimes too. However it's a good grounding in the basics and there are some useful exercises.,4
106846,I really liked this course it was fun and it taught me a lot about the course of writing and publishing.,5
106847,Very insightful and inspiring! Great hosts and guest speakers.,5
106848,really amazing :> thank you for this course :>,5

106850,"A good but simple introduction to writing. The instructors (particularly David) are friendly and helpful - it's just that nothing is dealt with in any great depth. However, that helps make it good as an introduction.",3
106851,This course helped me discover the writer inside of me.,5
106852,"This course is a complete package for those who aspire to be a fiction writer, it teaches all steps right from how to start writing to publishing. For me it was a dream course, really enjoyed it and I wish further course of such kind is available so I could join it . Instructors David Hill and Maria Gill were great and they taught in very effective manners and so were the guest speakers.",5
106853,Well constructed course.,5
106854,"I did the MOOC just to break the ice and have a general idea about this world of writing for young audiences. I think the course is fair and quite complete, has some very interesting insights, and the videos as very informative and the perfect lenght (by the time your head can't take more info, they are over). Thank you very much, it has been a pleasure.",4
106855,This course help me in my writing carrer,5
106856,Very good course. Many valuable information and advice about writing in general not just aimed at young readers. Would recommand.,5
106857,I love this course and the tips they provide are tremendously helpful while writing some extract or just some writing work. Thank you :)It's actually fun to be part of this course. I will continue the course till end.,5
106858,"Provides good basic information. The assignments are simple and can easily be ""passed"" by following directions, not necessarily by writing well. Many reviews say the critiquing is the draw-point of this class, but that is all done by fellow students not by publishing experts or professionals. So while this course ""opens the treasure chest,"" it leaves you a long way from publishable",3
106859,"This is a great course to get you writing. The interviews with writers are particularly helpful. The assignments are well thought out though there was some confusion when it came to peer reviews and how to assess word count which the staff are trying to sort out. Peer reviews were very varied as some people just wrote one word down which was no help at all, while someone inexperienced wil struggle with this I think the course should include an early module on reading and critically as reviewing someone's work is a great aid to writing and editing your own work. Course paperwork could include a critical checklist to help with peer reviews. I would have found that helpful so that I could be confident Of doing a good job. I think you should also be able to edit your reviews as a mistake will mean your fellow writer could be marked down. All in all though well worth doing. Many Thanks to the tutors, staff and guest writers.",4
106860,I enjoyed this course to the fullest extent possible. I loved how they made a few short videos every lesson instead of one long one like other courses provide. It made it incredibly manageable and easy to invest time into. It was a great learning experience and I will be looking into furthering my opportunities to become a published author because I now have the confidence and a bit more knowledge on the industry. Thank you so very much.,5
106861,Extremely helpful for those who love writing for children!,5
106862,"Excellent! It has interviews from different writers - different cultures, too - and also has basic concepts to start writing. I loved it, it really felt like opening a treasure chest, literally!",5

106870,"Very detailed, descriptive and knowledgeable videos. The two resource persons are excellent at their jobs. Thank you for improving my knowledge on writing.",5
106871,"The last two weeks of this course held great information. However, the first three weeks seemed to lack focus.",3
106872,"Good videos but strucural info and help. Unfortunately , for me it wasn´t very exciting or motivating and perhaps that is because of my own interests.",3
106873,Really helpful course for beginner writers - and particularly those looking to write for our youngest readers.,5
106874,"A great tool for beginner writes, but not very good at showing you how to write SPECIFICALLY for children.",4
106875,The instructors are great and the interviews are very useful. I would have liked to learn about tone and pacing of the stories. Is there a common structure (at least a basic one that we can later break?). Hollywood uses the three-act structure. Is this also useful for stories for young readers?I learned a lot but perhaps there should be a second course. I'd be interested.,4
106876,Its laid out nicely with just enough to,5
106877,I completed this course 100. I feel I never get publish with all the courses I taken every where. So I keep my treasure chest for later.,5

106880,Great introductory course! My writing improved tremendously and the interaction with other people was amazing.,5
106881,I learned some helpful tips on how to edit and how to better structure a story. But there were assignments particularly on the last two that should have used assignment two or three.,4
106882,"Excellent. Thanks to the professors' guidance, I wrote a children's picture book and have submitted my manuscript to a local publisher. Cross my fingers and toes for good measure!",5
106883,"Great introductory course for writing for children. Comprehensive topic coverage, however not too much detail.",4
106884,Very helpful and informative for aspiring writers!,5
106885,Wonderful to see and hear so many different authors giving advice and being able to learn from them. The instructors were well spoken and neatly organized or an online audience. Definitely a treat for the unpublished and aspiring authors. New tips for old dogs and pups. You can have others review your writing style and format. The only problems you may run into might be the students submitting for review.,4
106886,This course was excellent and helped me alot!!!!!,5
106887,"Awesome course, an incredible opportunity to polish writting skill and to meet some fellow writters.",5
106888,"Excellent course if you are a writer and don't know where to start and how to go on! Not only for young readers, in general!",5
106889,"Great, this course upgraded my view.",4
106890,Loved every minute of it.,5
106891,"I loved this course. Although I was familiar with a most of the topics already. I think from way back at school, and also from some reading on my own, but it has been a while, so it was good to go through it again. The assignments were really good. Week 5, about publishing, was what was most new to me. Would be nice if there's a follow-up course on 'Publishing'.One more thing, not sure why it's called 'Writing for young readers',.... I feel, there's not a lot specifically on writing for young readers.I'd say it's more like a (general) ""introduction to writing stories"". Still, this is a great course for anyone interested in starting to write.",5
106892,"It so great that now we have chances to take part in such interesting and helpful courses. The thing I like most of all in your course is that is collaboration of many people, who have the same passion. It is very important! And it disciplines me a lot!:-)",5
106893,Excellent demonstration with the easiest method.,5
106894,This course is jam packed full of helpful information. I like how the instructor sits and looks at us (the leaner) and talks. It helps feeling relaxed while learning. I feel I have learned more with this method.,5
106895,An excellent and very motivational Module! Thank you!!!,5
106896,I just started this mook and have learned more than any other writing course I've taken on coursera.,5
106897,"I wanted this course to focus specifically on strategies for engaging young readers, but it did not. Additionally, the method of assignment sharing is a file upload/download dropbox. I had fully intended to participate until I saw that. As a MOOC, I realize that there could be any number of individuals registering for this course using false information and uploading nefarious scripts that could hijack my computer should I download something from here. No thanks, Coursera. Epic fail.",2
106898,Information presented was too basic.,2

106907,I'm learning to write a book which is great.,4
106908,"Far too basic in content. It's clearly aimed at people with next to no experience at all on writing and publishing! However, it still is insightful and inspirational as, 'Writing for Young Readers' is taught by two established children writers and, packed with interviews of other writers from all around the world. A nice introduction but, just that -an introduction. If you have experience writing (for children or else)",3

106923,"This course should be given a basic or starter level tag. Some of the videos are great, but they cover very basic: things like genre and narration. I thought the presenters/teachers were great, and I liked their author interviews. I wish there had been more writing assignments. I am very glad I took the course.",3

I I did appreciate the prompt that the assignments gave me to actually sit down and write, but so far the feedback wasn't very helpful.

106932,The interviews and course discussion are invaluable in this course.,3
106933,"The general advice given is very good and useful, and the section",4
106934,These were very short lectures without a lot of content. For example the different kinds of publishing were described but no time was spent on how to evaluate publishers or how to decide what might work best for the author. The interviews with the published authors was by far the best part of this class and I enjoyed listening to them describe their writing lives.,2

106939,"I want to give it 3 1/2 starts - sometimes the modules seem really segmented and you spend half the time repeating the same ideas or recapping the course material (that was new that week!).While the assessment tasks were great exercises, the fact that they're peer-reviewed means that the feedback you get is often unhelpful or poorly informed.It was a good course to do, but I don't think it's really going to change anyone's life (and I would encourage people to not take the peer feedback too seriously!).",3
106940,"Learnt a lot, lessons are on video and are extremely articulate so did not miss a word. Teachers are knowledgeable and down to the most important details, hence, the course is not too long, and doesn't take forever to complete. Amazing!",5
106941,Provides excellent information and encourages new writers to pursue their goals.,5
106942,Very good Training! Lots of examples and practical knowledge.,4
106943,"This was a very helpful course, as well as entertaining.",4
106944,Great class!,4
106945,Very intetesting and complete. Would love a follow up. Didn't give 5 stars just because I think the course could have been even more specific about young readers target audience. Thank you.,4
106946,I have really enjoyed this course. It is very informative and inspiring! Not to mention that David Hill and Maria Gill both do an excellent job!,5
106947,It's perfect for teach beginning Children's book writers how to start writing,4
106948,"It's really great! More creative writing, please!!!",5
106949,"As a writer, this is a much needed course if you want to better yourself and learn the ropes on how to make a living as a writer.",5
106950,"The most fun a MOOC could possibly be. In addition to getting motivated to write, I've also found stuff to read by authors previously unknown to me.",5
106951,This is a great course that shows a path to those who want to get into writing. I enjoyed learning and the best part was the interviews with different authors across different countries. I will look forward to another courses with commonwealth education trust. Thank you.,5
106952,I simply love this course! There should be more writing courses on Coursera because this one has been very helpful and insightful for aspiring writers like me!,5
106953,"I learned a lot of interesting things. Both Maria and David were great teachers: they spoke clearly, making examples and trying to speak as slowly as possible (which is good for a not native english speaker as myself). The interviews were another interesting addition to the course, as the peer reviews: they were not created or structured to lead to failure but to selfimprovement an improvement trough other's advices. It was great. I hope they'll make another course like this in the future, it would totally have my enrollment.Thank you, to the both of you, for the things you taught me!",5
106954,A well designed course. I am learning a lot and improving my writing skills.,5
106955,"I loved the non-UK / American basis for the writing and the study texts: fascinating reads and great eye openers to other styles and languages. Such a rich source! The videos and interviews were great and I loved the transcriptions - they made life so much easier to make notes and annotate from.The main issue I have is with the 'peer' marked work throughout the course. I feel this was meant to be a collaborative tool for us to use, but instead turned out to be a rather awkward device. Some students gave leeway to the 500 words limit; others not. I was failed because my explanatory note - not the piece itself, just a note for context - took me 34 words over. How pedantic was that reader? Another piece I read was over 2000 words long and had obviously been taken from some other assignment: it barely fit the study brief. Additionally, are non English speaking students penalised by having to write in English? Grammar and syntax in the west is very different depending on the country you come from - German syntax vs Italian vs English. All are different. How can I be fairly marked if the reader of my work has English as a second / third language? By that same token, can I really pass a student who has met the course criteria, yet has mis-spelled many words, has little or no punctuation and has jumbled tenses all over the place. This needs to be sorted out I feel, as it has marred this course for me. I don't feel it gave an even playing field to all. Thank you for the opportunity though, I did enjoy it!",3
106956,Amazing. Very useful. Almost perfect.,5
106957,"Very helpful, this course show me that I'm not alone in this path. There are many people with same difficulties and devotion to make their ideas to come in to a fabulous books. thank you for this tool",5
106958,Very good course I learned so many helpful things. The teachers did their best to make the course entertaining and helpful. Thank you Maria and David!,5
106959,It was good tips. it has really interesting interviews. It was been really positive experience and encouraging to keep writing.,4
106960,Very cool easy going course. The videos are short and to the point and the authors in it speak clearly and are easy to understand and follow. The assignments are great fun to do and the community and forms are friendly. If you have an interest in writing in general and want to start writing I'd recommend it as it's good way to get started.,5
106961,"This is a fantastic course, it covers a lot of ground, it takes you through the entire process from generating story ideas to submitting your work to publishers. I gained a lot from doing it. The peer feedback system is effective and useful. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to take this course!",5
106962,Great course!,5
106963,"I loved this course. It was the first course where you need to interact with other course takers. I love it that you give feedback to each other. And the teachers are great. The lesions are simple, very clear and helpful. For me the way of teaching and teachers capture my attention.",5
106964,"Wow, really eye opening",5
106965,"This course is excellent, the content is rich, the videos are amusing and helpful, the interviews are just great. Thank you so much for such a high quality course!",5
106966,Such an enlightening and inspiring course!,5
106967,"Whether you are new to writing or looking for a new way to approach writing, take this course. The short writing exercises work so well with the video lectures.",5
106968,"It is perfect for beginners, but if you're an experienced writer you might be looking for something a little more challenging.",3
106969,"I loved the course. It was very informative and the interviews with authors were very special. I hope there will other courses for writers, new and accomplished, in the future.Thank you very much for taking time to put the course together.",5
106970,"An excellent course. The inclusion of excerpts allows one to develop a greater understanding of the different topics dealt in the MOOC. Also, several excerpts are from stories written by authors based in different continents; this makes reading the excerpts all the more interesting. Also, the course allows one to adjust the deadlines for submitting assignments, which is a good thing.",4
106971,great class! thank you for teaching it.,5
106972,What a fun course! I never knew I could write. I can't wait to get my first book published!,5
106973,"I really enjoyed this course! It has a very fun approach to writing for beginners, as well as having some interesting insights (I think) for those who are already experienced.",5
106974,"Wonderfull course, unlocks all our creativity!!",5
106975,Awesome :) Very interactive,5
106976,"Thoroughly enjoyed this course, it was really interesting and broken down into small, manageable chunks.",5
106977,Lovely course... the faculty was fantastic and guests,5
106978,"It gives helpful and easy to understand information about writing children's books. It also includes helpful documents to edit and proofread your writing, how to get published, writing query letters and advice from current authors about all of the above. You are able to write short pieces of work and have them reviewed.",5
106979,Very nice course! It makes me finally start writing things instead of reading books about how to do the writing. And it is definately a great course with so many writers' interview and techniques. Reading other's assignments is also great.,5
106980,Great introductory course that covers all the basics and doesn’t drag on.,5
106981,This is just what I looking for. It is very insightful and encouraging.,5
106982,Great class!!!!,5
106983,Very informative.,5
106984,"Very good course and Prof specialy guest Prof ,now really i have a tools to write story for children and teenager(my dream) ,i hope that i will succeed in my new experience.Thanks for all.",4
106985,I had fun and learnt alot!,5
106986,"Entertaining and informative, the course helps you start writing with great tips and suggestions for inspiration",5
106987,"Great if you literally know nothing about writing but want to write. Otherwise, the first three modules cover basic story writing information. What's great is the interviews with authors and the ability to peer review and so, read all sorts of things.",4
106988,"It definitely inspired my writing, as well as improved my techniques. The many interviews with other authors gave someone another view on how to write, transform and present one's own work.",5
106989,It was a really fun class with so many wonderful tips on how to improve your writing. I'm glad I decided to take it.,5
106990,great course,5
106991,Great course! Very well structured and taught. Great job by Dr. Brooks! If you're a coach training at any level this is a must-do course!,5
106992,This was a very useful course that helped me understand a lot about an athletes body and how to work on it as a coach.A 'must do' course for all coaches.,5
106993,It's an amazing and wonderful course that helped me understand a lot of thing in coaching,5
106994,"The course addresses quite precisely and pragmatically every aspect regarding young athletes anatomical and physiological development. All the information provided in the lectures is research-based and Dr. Brooks states clearly when she is providing information which needs further investigation or clarification. The lenght of the lectures is short and these are very well organized by modules, facilitating the learning process. The information is almost always related to its application to young populations. While the topics covered by the course represent a fair amount of the information a coach should have, psychologycal and social aspects, which are quite important for training young athletes, are not convered in depth. The assessments lack effective feed-back to support the learning process, given that after taking the quizzes you will only know if your answer was right or wrong, missing any instruction about the course content itself, and the only peer-assessed piece misses a feed-back section which may help to improve future writing.",3
106995,Incredible!!! Great course!!!,5
106996,A lot of hard work but this was exactly what I was looking for. A science-based approach with practical application to my coaching.,5
106997,The course covers with deep detail all aspect of training with young athletes.,5
106998,Really enjoyable course. Well structured with interesting content.,5
106999,The course was very informative with latest research into developing young athletes.,5
107000,Great course for all coaches of youth sports,4
107001,"The course is very valuable and I would recommend this course to anyone involved in sports. My interest was mainly as an athlete but also as a parent of two very young children. The insights gained for children's training were actually very valuable as I am now more confident and comfortable to allow the child to develop their sport skills through early sampling. The aim in this case is to support and instil in the minds of the children the benefits of being active and later on, if they wish to do so, enter a more specialised athletic path. My comment with regards to how the course is run is that I would have preferred if it was a bit more interactive. With 4 moderators I expected that the questions posed on the forum would have been answered but this was mainly not the case. Nevertheless, I highly recommend this course.",4
107002,Very interesting content!,5
107003,Simply wonderful! I great experience to understand the development of younh athletes.,5
107004,Exceeded my expectations.This should be a mandatory course for ALL young athlete coaches!,5
107005,Informative and excellent,5
107006,Very good course on the basics of coaching and training.sometimes we wish to learn more but it is only an introduction.The videos are really well made and the professor really knows her subject.,5
107007,Up-to-date materials. Has good grasp of sports science concepts.,5
107008,The great course. I hope that prof. Brook we continue her work. She is excellent teacher. I am awaiting for here new course.,5
107009,"Excellent course!Will use information to help my general health & wellness.Also highly recommend to any athlete, coach or anyone engaged in fitness.",5
107010,"For those interested in taking exams, these questions were poorly worded and it was evident that the person writing the questions in English was not proficient in the English Language. The material was interesting and up to date, but much was lost in translation.",2
107011,"This course is awesome. It introduce the Zika virus, epidemiology, genetics, and public health. Very diverse with the main actors which re working in the Zika outbreak! Strongly recommend. I watch the material to be informed with less bias and still having a strong scientific opinion, the articles and topics to discuss are a great asset to valid your concepts. I strongly recommend!",5
107012,"Great, clear, concise, explanations on everything. A collaborative effort with teams and specialists from all over the world sharing their contributions to this body of knowledge. Paticularly congratulate the effort to make this a well-ounded conversation both on the biological effects and economical, political and communications side of this problem.",5
107013,Trendy topic with talks from expertises in the field. Covered all areas of interest. Congrats!,4
107014,"Wonderful! Simple and clear language, good instructors, great stuff! Highly recommend!",5
